# solution

[code][2].

This is a typical [dynamic programming][3] problem (and my first time
encounter this concept).

```python
def main():
    n = 21  # number of nodes, not legs, per side
    grid = [0] * n * n

    for i in range(1, n):
        grid[i * n] = 1
        grid[i] = 1

    for x in range(n):
        for y in range(n):
            if not grid[x * n + y]:
                grid[x * n + y] = grid[(x - 1) * n + y] + grid[x * n + y - 1]

    print grid, max(grid)
```

Well, it turned out, this does **not** need computing even! Answer
is `40!/(20!*20!)`, what!!!!?

and someone mentioned [Pascal's triangle][4], but I don't get this.
