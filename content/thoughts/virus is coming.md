News of the new virus coming to the States is all over the place now,
and the stock market has been dropping like a stone. Panic?

I haven't heard many people talking about it, life is rather running
as usual, but I think this is hanging on everyone's mind now, that we
are just waiting for a phone call from school that school is shutting
down, or an email from company that you are all required to work from
home for the next two weeks.. then what? what about food? drink?
necessities in life, gas, internet? &mdash; there are so much
supports to make a modern life possible, that it's difficult to image
what it will be like when everyone, shuts down &larr; even though I
felt quite annoyed by China's shutting down Wuhan city and locked down
its ten million residents on the issue of a government order, I don't
see other way around this. The difference probably will be, how people
fare well in this situation, not that whether we can dodge such
situation entirely.

Watched a movie made in the 1990, [Hiroshima: Out of the
Ashes][1]. Sadly realistic, though I'm sure the reality back then was
ten times, a thousand times, worse. This also reminded me the book I
read which described life after the atomic bomb &mdash; we outsiders
and people were not on site during those catastrophes thought of the
tragedy lasting for only the duration of the hit. But for those
survivors, it was only the beginning of their miseries. This same
theme was echoed in [Chernobyl's café][2], that people living in that
area had no idea in that Sunday morning even when the military had
been deployed on the street measuring radiation level rising to lethal
grade. Then all of sudden, they were asked to pack and leave, in 4
hours! And? They were told the evacuation was for a few days, but they
never, ever, returned, till today, till the end of their life even,
cause the pollution of the disaster will not fade for another 250,000
years &mdash; can you imagine being uprooted like that? What about my
books? my cats? my favourate so and so? Nothing was allowed to leave
except yourself and one suitcase &mdash; cruel? necessary? victim of a
bureaucracy? bad luck? fate?.... I don't know how those 46,000 people
reconcile for the rest of their lives. I'm curious to learn what type
of support they were received after the uproot. But then, I'm not sure
I have the heart to hear their stories, to witness their tears, to
stand shoulder to shoulder w/ them at vigil, missing their loved ones
lost to the tragedy, harmed by it, and forever changed by it. 

Saw a joke about the virus, that North Korea, being an odd ball in
today's world, announced that they had one infection, shot to death,
now their infection count, 0, hahahaha... that's a style, one way to
deal w/ this. This brings me back to my argument of the [拐点][3],
that there are endless possibilities of a virus going forward. Until
we have an understanding of its course, and this can only be done
through science, all others are nothing but wishful thinkings &mdash;
I understand human must summarize, especially in such situation when
there are overwhelmingly amount of information, some truer than others
(but difficult to tell), in order to make sense so to guide his daily
action. Therefore, we need to be more sensitive of the downfall of
this tendency than usual, that by making summary out of ocean of info,
we are also risking to lose sight of the picture, and to lean more on
some than others, while these info are just random encounters to us
&mdash; we are fed by some authorities and channels, while whoever has
the loudest voice gets the attention, thus the preference.

In case you want to brush up your hand washing technique, here is a
[NPR][4] on the subject. Quite fun to watch ~~
