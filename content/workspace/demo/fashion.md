Project Fashion is built to support daily business
of an international trading company with a special focus
on fashion products. Its main functions include
product management, customer and vendor database,
order management (both sales and purchase), and inventory management.
For trading business, it is a bridge between
suppliers and clients. Its value added property lies
in offering client a uniformed view of products and services
regardless the suppliers' differences, and tracking
order throughout creation,
execution, closure, cancellation, and modification.
This system maps closely to each step of these
so a user only needs to run her own function while the system
will glue all pieces together to form a coherent workflow.
Not only information becomes transparent and accountable,
but efficiency is achieved through intelligent cross
reference and aggressive statistic analysis.

Read on about its [core functions and design considerations][2].
