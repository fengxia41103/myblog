I had a dream, as vivid as it can be, that I was walking next to
you. You were wearing the black dress, the one you look so refined and
elegant in. I reached out to your hand, but you retrieved it inside
your sleeve, and only after a couple tries that I was able to hold it
in mine. I couldn't tell whether you were happy or not. You were
probably reluctant.

But, at the moment, I felt so happy. It was like something long lost
found, well, it is, a person long lost, found. Then I woke up. 2:30 in
the morning. I wanted to text you to tell you that I have a dream of
you, again, and it hasn't been there fore a while, and I was really
scared that you stopped coming to my dream. Now you are there, again.

But, I didn't. It's really a struggle for me whether I should continue
to be present in your life, or should disappear altogether so that you
could have yours without any concern of me. I always think the latter
is better, better for you. But then, what am I to judge what's better
or worse? am I playing the God's hand again? I always have this
tendency to put myself in a superior position as if I am the wise one
that knows what's better. Well, not that I'm being arrogant or over
self-confident. I actually feel this way because I care so much, want
to make the best of, and wish the best for. And yet, everytime, it
comes out in such a negative way, at the receiving end anyway, that I
felt discredited, unfair, and disappointed. 

Why? I can only think that it  must be me, the only common denominator
in all  these cases,  that must  have something  wrong, a  low emotion
intelligence, a  blant attitude, or  just arrogance but myself  is not
seeing it.  However,  I know I didn't do anything,  say anything, with
any  intention  to be  misguiding,  looking  down on  ppl,  lecturing,
prejudicial, let alone lie or manipulative.  I will just kill myself I
ever fell  into the spell  of being someone  who lie or  is dishonest,
because I will be disgusted by myself  so much I couldn't be live with
myself anymore.

I miss you. Yes, I do, many many many times. I tried to hide your from
my mind,  so you could live  in a space  in me that is  not disturbed,
quiet, safe,  and sweet. Yet, there  you are, always stroll  out, many
times a day,  not a word, not a  sound, not a smile or a  cry, but you
are there. I talk to you, somehow,  sometimes of things I just did and
thought I did it  well, so want you to feel proud, to  say "I know you
are  the best";  sometimes just  sadness,  moments I  don't feel  like
seeing anyone else, talking to anyone else, just you, being there, the
only one I still have a wish to talk to, about things that saddens me,
bothers me.

And this dream, feels so real, so real. I don't know whether you felt
anything at that moment. Were you sleeping then? Did you hide your
hands in your sleeves and didn't want to give it to me? and did you
come along to walk by my side?

I don't  know where you  are anymore. It's ok  that none of  these has
been true, it's ok  it's a dream that it disappears when  I wake up. I
still feel it,  as real as it  could be, as wonderful as  it could be,
because it had you, in it.
