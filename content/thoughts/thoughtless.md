Sitting here in the sun feels like Cambodia, humid, hot, the green
plants look greener after a day of rain, and w/ Noah fooling around
here and there w/ his primal bow and arrow, and Zhuzhu lying by the
feet. Peaceful, quiet, eventless weekend morning. 

But somehow, my mind is disturbed, for things that I don't have a clue
what to do w/, such as the long Raak packages arrived on Tuesday
(320lb of them, and 15 ft long), what am I gonna do to get them over
to the new place? I don't know. But also, for the subtle feeling that
I wish I had more thoughts, things that anger me and make me want to
express, but then, not much I want to write about, because I don't
find them interesting, annoying, a sign that I care less and less and
less, and this feeling, is not good. Am I losing a sharp mind? or
losing a care for right and wrong, for a self-confidence that I can
make a difference? I fear it's the latter, and that's what is bad
about it.

Did another POC over the last two weeks, [an git+jira
analyzer][1]. Maybe it's the tiredness after an intense
development. Could be. Caught up w/ Dr. Shen, Tong Jin, and Jessie
yesterday. Putting a will questionnaire together. Gradually, I'm
putting my life in order, and preparing my life to be closed
whenever. Not that I'm ready for death, but I want to leave w/o much
left-over regrets. Make me wonder whether everyone has an urge to
_leave something behind_? But then, how many people's biography really
interests others? I haven't even read anyone's, including the famous
Jobb's. Yeah I do watch documentaries that describe a person's life,
and always finding them [inspiring and memorizing][2]. But hardly I
would think anyone wants to read mine, nor would I read it as a
reader.

So, for a life, for a life like my Dad's, what would he have left
after he leaves? All his traits disappear without a trace. His family
will gradually die out if children becomes less and less, and even w/
children, how many of his traits will be passed on? Not many. Each
generation is a new crop. So in the end, it's very true that we came
fro dust, and end as dust.

So on the questionnaire, I put down:

> I'd like to be cremated and have the ashes divided into two. 
> One is to be scattered in an unknown farming place anywhere in Japan.
> The other is to be scattered in HuiLi County, Sichuan Province,
> P.R.China.
> Pick a Spring sunny day with a lot of wild flowers in the field. 
> No permanent memorial of any kind.

Be a nameless is not only a common fate. It's the ending I'd like to
have &mdash; nameless, hopefully, also regretless, or less-regrets.
