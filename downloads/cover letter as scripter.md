Hi,

My resume might shows that I'm a high-up manager these days, which I
am because seniority of skills brings much responsibility in a
team. But I have always been hands-on, and amÂ a scripter as good as
one could get. My main tool is Python in that regard. Not to mention
that I'm full stack capable, also.

In term of data retrieval, cleansing and analysis, I have done many
projects including a data analysis web application integrated w/
theÂ World Bank API, writing data crawler of web page, parsing plain
text including TSV, CSV, JSON, YAML, XML formats, and in some jobs
creating parser of binary file formats. In term of data security, I
was a top researcher and developer of a data security startup who
specialized in application control and virus breach. In term of
analytical skills my track records should be sufficient to show its
worth. And for analysis reporting and documentation my previous works
such as the reference architecture published on the Lenovo website
would testify well.

I'm interested in this project, and think my skills should be useful
to propel the research forward. Thus I'm applying for this position,
and am looking forward to hearing from you soon.



Best,

feng
