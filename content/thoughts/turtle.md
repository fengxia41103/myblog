Walking back from gym a moment ago, passing the 奈何桥 I was always
joking about with her back then. Nice, cool late Spring day, beautiful
weather, beautiful sunshine, beautiful sky, almost beautiful day. Out
of the glittering sun reflection off the pond, there was this lazy
dark patch floating over there &mdash; a turtle, just enjoying its
time, like I felt.

I was watching it, and immediately the thought came to me, that
probably like everyone else who, if had watched this scene, would have
thought, that if only my life is like this guy, just taking time
floating in this peaceful pond, enjoying the weather, enjoying the
life, how nice would that be!

Then, I realized that, with earphone plugged in, I was also listenning
to Mozart's Minuet in D, that is now the tune that I have played many
many times for Dad in 泰康 in his room, that I found peaceful,
relaxing, and beautiful. But then, the turtle had no such tune &mdash;
however he was enjoying his time, he has no Mozart.

So really, the **perfect life** I was thinking, and probably true to
many who felt that way relating this turtle, but without realizing, is
that we want to be like the turtle, having a good time in this pond,
not rushing, but also, having Mozart by our ears, or a big ass TV
playing your favourate show, or some food to fit your appetite, or a
lover to satisfy your emotion or your body, or a good job or title to
meet your ego and monetary goal, or a car you picture yourself to race
on the road or drive by your ex- whatever, or a clothes that makes you
look like that _exact_ picture in Vogue, or a handbag (which is a
topic I have really little clue why it's good, how it is good, and
honestly I couldn't tell the difference. Period.)...

So really, we are all after, is a combination of a lot of things, a
lot of conditions that need to be TRUE, at the same time, all be
there, all be available, all be playing out, all be present, all be
yours. This is not greed. This, is life, or be more precise, an image
of life, that you put yourself in, imagining you being the character
in that picture, in the center &mdash; the center of the scene, the
center of the story line, the center of that comedy or tragedy, the
center of all the attentions, the center of the playwright, the center
of that composed, virtual, but also sooo real, universe.

How interesting. I have always had the feeling that sometimes I felt
this entire life thing, the desire I feel, the disappointments I had,
the frustration, or happiness, are all nothing but a projection out of
my mind. Not that they are thus changeable by just switching your
mindset/prospective. Quite the contrary, they take a life sooo strong
in their own that they overwhelmed me to the point that sometime I
felt life was too hard to continue, and sometimes too beautiful to let
go &rarr; thus, lost in between, start to wonder what is real, what is
truly the meaning of all these, are these really, necessary,
inevitable, or just a made up by myself, like a
self-entertainment. But then, I were the `director` of all these,
feelings, why can't I control it, make them, different, remove the
parts I don't like, and leave the parts I do like? Wny can't I!? why
can't we!?

The turtle floated towards me slowly, as if it noticed my watching,
but decided to went back into the water and disappeared. Maybe it has
his tune of Mozart, maybe it doesn't really care about Mozart at all,
like I don't care a bit of that fish he finds it hot, or that piece of
mud hole he calls home. Maybe, he is not that enjoying the day at all,
but like some colleagues smokeing in the smoke area, just taking a
smoke break, or a coffee break, so the turtle is taking its **whatever
break**!?

Maybe. I don't know. I would not ever know. But one thing I do know,
and I felt it, again, uncontrollable, like all the other emotions I
wish to get rid of but can't, or the ones I wish to stay but sometimes
hard to find again &mdash; I miss you, wish you were here, so I could
tell you about my thoughts of this turtle, and you will nod, or
ignore, or just play your phone, or just doing nothing. But no
matter. You will be here, next to me, and that, is my dreamed life.
