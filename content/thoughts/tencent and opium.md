Listening to [this talk][1] this morning, the thought hit me. How do
you look at this [game][2]?

Games, in my humble opinion, are just, bad. I know it's unfair to say
so since I have grown out of that addiction phase, and every boy/man
will go through that sometime in their life, inevitably. I don't know
the psyche or chemistry or bio-trigger behind this phenomenon. There
must be reason, especially a chemical reason. Brain likes it not
because it feels good, because there is a chemical stuff that equals
**feeling good** &mdash; just the same stuff in different outfit,
_gamble = sex_ that kind of high.

But what bothers me is this. When the entire Chinese population is so
trenched in their **moral high ground** through education (which
myself is a victim, too) that the recent history of humiliation
started with [the Opium War][3] caused by nothing but foreign bully
and their blood-thirsty greed, don't they see the parallel of what
they are doing right now, with this game!?

When investors are getting a high from Tencent's big hit, how is it
different from the East Indian Company was rewarded for their 
success in selling this great stuff called [Opium][4] to the
unexplored _super market_  &mdash; the Orient/the great middle kingdom
of China? It's the same in my opinion.

Because for market and investment, there is nothing about moral,
nothing about right and wrong (and who gets to define these anyway? do
you really even know what a right is? Is there even such a thing as
_being right_?) It is all about returns, which is objective, clear
cut, and zero-emotion. As long as the market responds positively and
cash flows in, investors are happy. These same set of investors can,
at the same time, be mad at some other corporations who are doing the
**evil** by ruining some other people's lives. If the suffering is
remote enough, and I do mean _remote_ being in both the geographical
sense and logic sense, it become just another news slip crossing the
screen.

This is curious then. In human core, we **do not** operate on facts,
at all. We operate on a set of images we believe &rarr; beliefs. These
beliefs are self-fulfilling. They can be completly contradictory, yet
causing no hesitation in one's thought or behavior. We don't even
realize them in most times. We can equally defend them one way or the
other. They are just equally true.

So how do you explain feelings like _shame_, _disappointment_,
_regret_, _anger_? Aren't they then just a creation of yourself,
because they came from perceived misalignment between your belief
versus facts? If so, doesn't it mean that you then don't have a
justification to whine, to feel bad, to become angry or annoyed, or to
feel that way at all? Extending this out, doesn't it mean all
critics become pointless, because they are based on a view, and that
is just subjective and arbitrary? How do you look at history then,
such as the [Opium War][3]? It is a national scar. But since their
motivation and execution back then were just as natural and logical as
what we are seeing right now with Tencent, how can one continue to
blame the war and those _barbarians_?

How about public opinion then? How about a popular belief that
everyone adopts, at least for now? If all these go out of the window,
how do we act? Shouldn't I still feel anything? If they are all just
my own wishful thinking, why can't I change a view and viola, all the
bad stuff are just disappear? In other words, why can't I **fool**
myself all of the time? If I could, then isn't it really becoming a
Matrix world, in which no one is living; they are merely experiencing
a virtual blank. How scary is that!

I don't know. This one seems to raise more questions than it
answers. I was meant to criticize the Tencent fans for their
paradox. But then, what am I to _judge_? The paradox is valid; but I
could not explain, nor have a solution. I feel it is so universally
true that it's even false to point it out as I am doing (I think I'm
doing).

What a bizarre and convoluted reasoning?
