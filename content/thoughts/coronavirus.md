The entire episode of 2020 Coronavirus is an ugly reality show. The
poor Dr. Li died, and it's really sad, and ugly, an ugly truth that a
hero was not born to be one; rather, they were becoming one by pure
accident because they stepped forward, unknowingly,  becoming _out of
line_, _standing out_ among the crowd, at the _wrong_ time when a wave
of collapse was to sweep through.... Li didn't foresee the scale of
this epidemic; he is not a God. I don't believe anyone did, including
the scolded Wuhan mayor who "should have taken this more seriously"
&mdash; nonsense!! Li, practically speaking, is a hero not because of
his prediction, but because of a mass sentiments brewing in the
background who are so fed up by the official bureaucracy and its
**child-like reaction**, that they need one spokeman, an icon, an
image, to shout their minds in a safe distance &mdash; and when this
_hero_ is in past tense, so the more convenient.

In the end, praising someone to be a hero is nothing but another move
of cowardice, reminding me the line by [Lyudmila Yevtushenko][1] in
the movie [Battle for Sevastopol][2]: 

> "I am 25 years old and I have killed 309 fascist invaders by

We, myself, and billion others, are only hiding behind hero's
back. Not only so. To justify our feeble attempt, we, on the one hand,
make an altar for our hero, putting their photos up high, as a sign of
respect; on the other, we turn to the cause of the misery, not to
scold its maker and feel disgusted by it, but instead, searching a
justification in the pile of debris &mdash; that's when a glass bead
is said to be as shining as a diamond, and is as worthy as one, too.
