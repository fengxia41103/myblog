Have you observed something that ppl do, and you just wonder *what the
hell**? Yes, I find human behavior very puzzling. Maybe it's just me
that is not connected with surroundings and felt isolated. But
seriously, there are just these things that ppl do that I can't help
thinking the word `irrational` is too polite to describe.


These days, nothing annoys me more than the morning rush and
aggressive drivers.  So I was driving to work seven o'clock in the
morning in my little Prius C which can only go that fast on the road
anyway, and boy, cars were just tailgating, then got impatience, swing
to the next lane, bypassing me as if running from a disease, there
might even be some dirty look involved and a few curses like `asian
guy just doesn't know how to drive` that type of thing. But
seriously!? 
   
First of all, there are like a million cars right in front of me, and
they are all driving more or less in the same speed, so
bypassing me at your top speed only means one thing &rarr; step
on your brake so you don't hit the car right in front of me
&rarr; seriously, don't you know `distance / speed = time`?


Just out of curiosity, who leaves house seven o'clock in the morning
instead of staying in their cozy houses? Chances are we are all going
to work. Well, so ask yourself, how many ppl you know who at least
claim that they **love* their jobs? Few I suppose. So here are these
enthusiastic drivers who are _eager_ to get to work! I mean, I can
understand there are some ppl who might have emergency to take care,
some who are just love their jobs, but seriously, the disproportional
number of cars going fast on the road just amazes me. I wonder what
type of paradise they work at?

On the similar note, if you do have something so important that you
have to rush like this, well, quoting my beloved [Professor Michel][1]:
<span class="myhighlight">there is always an earlier train</span>. So
get up earlier! The highway is open `24x7`, you know that, right?

And here is something even more fantastic. Ppl literally step on their
gas to pass me while I was cruising towards a <span
class="myhighlight">RED</span> light!? wow, this is just beyond my
comprehension completly, ultimately, thoroughly. _uh, are you going
to drive through it?_ I would love to see it. I thought you are in a
hurry, why stop?... I don't know. They are either blind, or just
stupid. If passing me gives them pleasure, I guess that's one positive
way to look at this.

Then, there is the control. There have been quite a few times the
annoying driver turned out be someone working in the same company
cause we all pulled in the same parking lot. Here stepping out some
harmless looking man or woman, I just wonder why they were so
_impatient_ while now they are just taking the slow stroll as everyone
else to the office, no hurry, no rush, no enthusiasm anymore. Why?
Were they really pushy, or it was just my perception that was faulty?
I tend to blame the rear view mirror for this &mdash; didn't it have a
label saying "_object seems closer than it actually is_"? But then,
why making them look closer, if being closer makes personal
uncomfortable? Yeah, it's all rear view mirror's fault. Peace.

Pickups. Pickups are the worst. They bully, just because they
can. Once a while I got the same `move over slow ass` type of gesture
from small engine cars, too! and that just felt strange. Shouldn't we
small engines support each other? Apparently not so. This, I think,
also signifies what we see in society, that ppl in weak positions
don't bundle together. Instead, they actually tread each other to get
ahead, even the gain is small. Interesting. But don't they sometimes
all uniformly doing the same **wrongs** also as if they are so tightly
integrated that nothing different can be tolerated and even imagined!?
So what sway them one way or another?

I don't know. Human is a mysterious being to me. Or, maybe my sense
just got it all wrong. How sad.
