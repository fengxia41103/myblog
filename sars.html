<p>Sitting at coffee shop and after a cup of coffee, my mind is always,
springing back to life ~~ </p>
<p>So it suddenly occurred to me, what happened SARS? I read all these
optimistic beats in wechat, and got seriously worried about what
people are deriving by shallow observation and an implied impatience
to end this misery as soon as possible. Who doesn't!? But the
documentary watched w/ Noah the other day, [Virus Empire: From SARS to
Ebola], made me feel quite otherwise from these sentiments &mdash; the
Spanish Flu virus killed only 145 people in its first ran, but two
years later wiped 50 million &mdash; no kidding, no shit, no
mercy. Again, like engineering work I do, sentiment counts for nothing
in the face of detail, practicality, and reality &mdash; you can wish
however you want, the things will work when all gears match, or
collapse when a single screw is missing. That, is the life.</p>
<p>Googled SARS, the very first hit is by <a href="https://www.who.int/csr/sars/en/">WHO</a>, of course, and I has
no reason to doubt its credibility. It has a <a href="https://www.who.int/csr/don/archive/disease/severe_acute_respiratory_syndrome/en/">"Situation Updates -
SARS"</a> section listing its trackings in reverse chronicle order, and
interesting enough, the last line, <a href="https://www.who.int/csr/don/2004_05_18a/en/">May 18, 2004</a> &larr; ah, talking
about going back in time, history, let's see.</p>
<p>Now, this news, is just, disturbing! WTF!</p>
<blockquote>
<p>China’s latest SARS outbreak has been contained, but biosafety concerns remain – Update 7
18 May 2004</p>
<p>It has been more than three weeks since the last case was placed in
isolation in China’s latest SARS outbreak, prompting the World
Health Organization to declare that the chain of human-to-human
transmission appears to have been broken.</p>
<p>However, WHO experts and the Chinese authorities are still trying to
determine the exact cause of the outbreak. The investigation has
centred primarily on the National Institute of Virology in Beijing
where experiments using live and inactivated SARS coronavirus have
been carried out. Two researchers at the Institute developed SARS in
late March and mid-April. The outbreak was reported on April 22 and
the Institute was closed a day later.</p>
<p>Preliminary findings in the investigation have yet to identify a
single infectious source or single procedural error at the Institute
– and it is conceivable that an exact answer may never be
determined. Neither of the researchers is known to have directly
conducted experiments using live SARS coronavirus. However,
investigators have serious concerns about biosafety procedures at
the Institute – including how and where procedures using SARS
coronavirus were carried out, and how and where SARS coronavirus
samples were stored.</p>
<p>WHO and Chinese authorities view with concern the occurrence of
laboratory-associated SARS cases. WHO urges all Member States to
view this latest outbreak as an opportunity to review the biosafety
practices of institutions and laboratories working with SARS
coronavirus.</p>
<p>During and after the SARS outbreak of 2003, a large number of
specimens were collected from possible human cases, animals and the
environment. These specimens, which may contain live SARS
coronavirus, are still kept in various laboratories around the
world. Some of them are stored in laboratories at an inappropriate
containment level. SARS coronavirus has also been propagated in
reference and research laboratories, and distributed to other
laboratories for research purposes. Research using live and
inactivated SARS coronavirus – and other pathogens capable of
causing serious illness -- is being conducted in many laboratories.</p>
<p>WHO has issued the following laboratory safety guidelines and
recommendations:</p>
<p>• WHO biosafety guidelines for handling of SARS specimens (25 April
2003)</p>
<p>• Summary of the discussion and recommendations of the SARS
laboratory workshop of 22 October 2003</p>
<p>• WHO post-outbreak biosafety guidelines for handling of SARS
coronavirus specimens and cultures (18 December 2003)</p>
<p>In these guidelines, WHO strongly recommends Biosafety Level 3 (BSL
3) as the minimum containment level to work with live SARS
coronavirus. WHO also urges Member States to maintain a thorough
inventory of laboratories working with and/or storing live SARS
coronavirus and to ensure that necessary biosafety standards are in
place.</p>
<p>WHO commends the Chinese authorities for taking swift action to
contain the latest outbreak once it was recognized and reported, by
way of extensive contact tracing and the quarantine and medical
observation of such individuals. Once again, it has been
demonstrated that SARS is a containable disease.
</p>
</blockquote>
<p>So SARS was, <strong>speculated</strong> to have come from the <em>National Institute
of Virology in Beijing</em>, and now we all know Wuhan happened to have a
Lvl 4 Bio lab, now the whole city is locked down, and the whole world
is, worked up... coincidence!?</p>
<p>I think, yes? no? yes? no?... </p>
<p>Btw, I'm entirely not sure about the idea of <strong>turning point (拐点)</strong>
&mdash; I mean, is this even a legitimate concept in describing a
viral outbreak!? I seriously doubt it, because it's very easy to
perceive such a thing in a simple curve. But hey, let's look at a Sine
wave, and you tell me which is the turning point!? The whole
assumption of this term lies in that once it passes the peak, it will
start to steadily decrease and approximating zero in the long run
&mdash; but, isn't that a wishful thinking!? I don't think virus agree
w/ this at all, otherwise, by mathematics all viruses will be,
containable, because it is just a matter of how long this curve is
&mdash; HIV takes like years, flu, 7 days (so I'm operating when Noah
gets sick), and so on... But this is just pure naive. <strong>Why not a curve
ever going up!? Why not a cyclical pattern like a Sine wave!? Why not
a flat line for ever and ever!?</strong> What is the assumption to rule out
these patterns? and how these assumptions are proved!?</p>
<p>Again, this outbreak is a like an awesome reality show that everybody
is now involved, everybody has to act and react, and it's like how
human will show their true ingredients in front of a dire situation,
here we are, standing naked in front of virus, and each one acting in
a way to justify the situation and make peace w/ him/her-self. A
majority of the Chinese, from what I read and heard, are going through
a pretty clear struggle of "yes they should be shut in their houses,
otherwise they will be acting selfishly", to "I'm sacrificing my own
little convenience for a greater good", thus feeling elevated
self-pride, to "enough is enough, I'm done w/ my duty, and now let me
out and play, and if you stop me, eat my ass"... Fascinating, isn't
it?</p>
<p>I think shutting down the city was a sound decision. Creating panic by
not being transparent was a bad decision. Acting patriotically is
great on individual basis, but a terrible deed to be broadcasted and
even promoted on government's end. I'm glad that modern infrastructure
is able to support these many people being locked in a cage (actually,
to think about it, it's not much difference living in the city on a
common day vs. in lock down days &mdash; your radius of movement is
just those few blocks, and entertainments are all at your finger tips
as long as virus doesn't attack your router or your ISP). So the
perception of anxiety is really from self-pity, sympathy, and boredom
once it lasts for too long &mdash; the same logic when you wait in
line at bank for over 10 min, you grow impatience, and even angry, but
the reality is, that 10 min doesn't make a dime of difference for
99.99999% of the people (especially if you still need to go bank line
for their service ~~ if your time is that precious, trust me, bank
waits for you, not the other way around). It's just a psychological
thing.</p>
<p>Anyway. I feel sorry for people who are going through this. I
constantly think this is a man made, disaster, not that its origin is
man made (that is going to be a conspiracy theory for many years to
come), but the way we handle it, and the way we live through it
&mdash; like war, not that all die and no one lives through it &mdash;
millions did survive.</p>
<p>But, who wants to go back and relive those days, again!?</p></p>
