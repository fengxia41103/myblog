Does everyone has talent? With popularity of the smart phone, all of
sudden, everyone is now a photographer, generating tons of photos, and
some of them are actually quite pleasing. Why do they post them in
wechat? To get attention? compliment? or, just that, they think they
have a _hidden_ talent, thus waiting to be discovered?

We have heard the cliche that 千里马常有，而伯乐不常有. Once upon a
time I was thinking the same thing of myself. But now, I wonder,
whether it's truly so? Thinking of you this morning, while reading the
blogs I wrote over this year. I wish I could share them w/ you
somehow, and wonder how you would feel reading them. But then, I had
to remind myself that girls are usually a lot more practical than guys
at the same moment, that the decisions they make are actually quite
advanced, just that guys didn't understand. If looking at them as a
bystander, I have to agree w/ the girls &mdash; and also, that the
guys in the same scene were usually so immature and clueless that it
is rather pathetic.

But, does it also apply to myself? Is it why I felt so stuck at the
emotion in those blogs, while the reality has been that I was just
clueless and immature, thus making it even more right for you to 断舍
离? (but honestly, I dislike this word at all! not only because it
hurt me, but that it felt rather bogus and like an execuse &mdash; if
one were to 断，it doesn't mean s/he would have to leave离, or give
in. 断is not to continue on the same path as it were, but this person
could still be in your life). Anyway.

Ran into a teeny tiny coffee shop yesterday. What an interesting
setup! It can seat, 3 ppl? Dim lights, not because they wanted the
mood, but the space is so small and caved in, that it simply has
little natural lights. The space was jammed w/ all kinds of
handwritten notes mixed w/ English, mostly about the business itself,
introduction of coffee beans, and a cool stereo setup that played some
rather _strange_ music after I asked them to play some music. The
music made the space a bit, time traveling, I would say. It was soo
dim that hardly any of my photos came out well. But it's ok. The owner
is a really cool guy &mdash; just about everything he has, from a
handmade apron to his tiny water kettle, measure cups, brew gears,
grinders, some small arts here and there on his home made shelf and
walls, a stack of old books half the height of the only window in the
room, piles of beans in its linen bags on a pallet, two canvas bags on
top &mdash; one has his diving gears, and another is a travel duffle
bag, a tennis bag, a guitar, and music and chocolate and coffee bean
smells in the air, and a woman who claimed herself to be his wife (but
she looks _unfamiliar_ with this setting, rather like a visitor, like
myself).... impressive. 

This makes me wonder, whether the purpose of travel, or the fruit of
travel, is to discover these places, these people? But I don't
know. Rather, I would agree w/ 陈涤's comment, though it felt a bit
like a universal truth, that travel to a place is to reconcile
&mdash; to reconcile w/ yourself, w/ this world, w/ this
life, w/ the person you love/hate, w/ the matter you
care/want-to-ignore, w/ your own past and your inevitable next
day. If you happen to be in a place like this coffee shop, maybe it is
fateful, also, that such things make you stay, to take a break, to
relax, to enjoy, and to discover beauty again.

I liked the coffee, not because it was charming, but it left a taste
lingering for a while &mdash; it was bitter, but settling, makes me
think of you &mdash; you may make me sad, but you make me, real.
