This is a quite fascinating argument, and quite unexpected when I'm
reading this book, [Mosquitoes, Malaria and Man][1].

So in name of development, as it is another "-ism", those that do not
benefit the course of it will be deemed unworthy. Again, I found
emphasis on individual, value and right of an individual, is
constantly being challenged, if not at all denied, by these "in the
name of <fill in your label>" _beliefs_. 

I  recall  listening to  Jeffery  Sachs  at  BU  when he  argued  that
perpetual progress is  neither possible nor practical  &mdash; even if
we believe in that universe is inifite, traveling straight towards one
direction will  only bring us back  to where we are.  Economy progress
and development can not go upwards  forever, and I think his point was
that it should not, either. Implication is not only that all resources
on earth will not be enough to support everyone living like Americans,
but this story  of malaria highlighted another aspect  when things are
viewed in a cost-benefit model.

Written in  1978, this argument  has yet convinced mass  to reconsider
the path we are  on, achievements we yearn for, value  of life (as the
Chinese have gone through mania of the  age of success in the last few
years, when preaching of success was  the talk of the day), whether we
can only  go forward, in  a forever  motion of moving  faster, growing
bigger, richer.

I  don't know  whether there  is  a cap  of  human society,  be it  in
population,  in wealth,  in  resource consumption,  in creativity,  in
imagination,  in  invention of  disaster,  in  fostering bias  and  in
correction of  faults.... In theory  I would  think there is  an upper
limit. I'm just living at the tip of its early phase, I suppose. There
is a long way to go, I hope.
