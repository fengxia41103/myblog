I  have   been  doing  a   lot  of  thinking  recently,   about  human
society. There are multiple themes in my life and in my thinkings that
I find them interesting, disturbing, annoying, and saddening. The more
books  I'm reading  about  historical  events and  views,  the more  I
question how a  society, or any society, can survive  and develop, and
whether there  is a  pattern (or  lesson to  learn from)  that propels
their initiation, growth, and declination?

I don't know. Human society is messy. That's the only word I can think
of. Listening to NPR makes this  feeling stronger all the time &mdash;
I  actually  feel sorry  for  government  officials, politicians,  and
advocates who are  either in a position to _serve_  the people, and to
help  _all_. It's  an illusion  that, in  my opinion,  both wrong  and
impossible. I'm not sure how much they really believe in what they are
saying and preaching, and they are set out to do. Chances are, I would
dare to bet, they are feeling  the conflicts within themselves all the
time, that they are not devoted as they show to their cause, but then,
they are in a position that  they have to pretend, not necessarily for
fame  and  glory,  but  for their  survival  and  reconciliation  with
themselves.

# tested

This is sad.  Reading the book [Auschwitz][1] made me  wonder how deep
the  rabbit hole  goes!? It  strikes me  when the  German commando  of
concentration camp questioned how someone  who had not been **tested**
could be his judge? This is very  true I think. If you haven't been in
that situation,  you really don't know  how much yourself is  going to
change, and  how much that toxic  environment is going to  modify your
behavior and thinking. For these natiz criminals (this I have no doubt
that they have  done the anti-humanity act not out  of their excuse of
_following the order_, but out of  a balanced decision of _benefit and
cost_  &mdash;  it  could  have   been  completly  rational  at  their
individual level),  at least  they have  done what  they have  done in
those context, and we  know how low they had been.  But because of the
extreme characteristics of those act,  it should also raise a question
mark on  the head of  everyone else who  is being judgmental  of being
right or wrong.

I know there were many great examples and people who did not fall into
the low in the same overall circumstances. But do they then serve as a
proof of  human strength?  I mean,  how much  can we  generalize these
attributes against the ugly ones? What I see is an alarming pattern of
people who submit themselves to the oppression as a majority's choice,
this echoes  the same question  I asked  小舅 about why  people didn't
revolt during the Culture Revolution. I  don't know what is the theory
behind this,  but it has been  demonstrated over and over  and over in
Holocust of any form, and which could only mean that this reaction and
mechanism is a built-in part of human  &rarr; so as long as you and me
are human, we own this attribute,  and will **inevitably** at mercy of
its effect. But how to interpret heroes and heroic acts in those times
then?  They  were  human,  too.  Why didn't  they  suffer  from  these
built-ins?

I don't know. I wonder whether it is again a trick of labeling that I
have been debating with myself recently (a lot). You see, we take a
certain type of act as being heroic, while viewing others as
criminal. But what is the criteria to judge them? Law? isn't law also
written by a bunch human? then who says their opinions should be the
_law_? To that matter, there are many words I start to question (but
no answer yet):

1. science
2. hate vs. love
3. race
4. discrimination

I feel they have been over-used in such a blanket fashion that it's
really an abuse now.

# science

Science is being spoken as if itself is a Truth, a good thing. No.  It
is a view, an opinion, just like all others. Its difference from
previous Gods and superstitions is that its equations and
interpretations can in some cases predict the future &mdash; when is
the next total eclipse? But quoting something as _scientific_ in many
many discussions is not even centered around this, but as a
take-for-granted attitude that science is better than (whatever your
argument is).

No, no no! This is just BS. This is what I call **labelling**. You
slap a label called scientific onto your argument, and violla, yours
become valid, accurate, and better &mdash; or do they!? I would
immediately challenge:

1. What is your definition of _being scientific_? 
2. What is your proof that yours is _scientific_? (and mine isn't)
3. Why yous being _scientific_ is therefore better than [blank, fill
   in whatever you are arguing about]?
   
Exactly. Science is not a catch-all phrase. It does **requires** a way
of thinking (through experiment and quantification), which is being
highly regarded by current human race. But objectively speaking, it is
on an equal footing with other views of this world. I think its power
lies in two folds, which makes it a implementation (for the time
being, my life for sure):

1. its **much-more-likely-to-be-true** predictability than other
  methods on a day-to-day minute-to-minute basis. 
2. its ability to **uncover more of what we didn't and don't know**,
  eg. was the earth round, or flat?  how to identify a place on the
  earth globe (using a
  tuple of longitude and latitude numbers.)  


But when somebody claiming
his is scientific without addressing the above three questions, he
is lying, abusing this word, and is exactly being unscientific.

# hate vs. love

This came from a conversation w/ Noah in car. I commented on a _bad
driver_ (in my personal perception), and he said he has a word to
describe this &mdash; fxxx. Certainly I don't want to encourage him
using such word. But also it became to me that you **need something to
describe such a strong feeling**.

Any human will develop these emotions, and who can really say one
emotion is _good_ and another is _bad_? I mean, what do you mean by
calling it good? Any kid will learn these emotions eventually, and
they exist as a matter of fact. You need all of them to live this life. So
hate is just another strong emotion that will occur someday.

I think the real difference is at handling these emotions. But again,
if you view something as negative, you will try to avoid and punish
it. So we have anger control, we have _don't make war, make love_
&mdash; the underline assumption is that love is better than hate. 

I found this curious. Not only they are both strong feelings I have
argued to be perfectly valid to exist, but also I challenge why hate
is a worse feeling than love!? Is it because hate is going to cause
more harm to oneself and others? This is a good point I can
accept. But then does it mean how much harm is the criteria to judge?
Sounds so, then how much harm is ok, or just any harm is bad? and
further, harm to whom? What if my hate only harm me? or is there such
a thing as **an isolated harm, or isolated me**?  You see, very
quickly this logic is running into a subjective domain that I don't
think anyone has a clue.

Even further, as we all know the cliche, hate and love are like twins
&mdash; they feed each other, support each other, and become each
other! So really, I don't see hate is being bad at all. It is just a
strong feeling that one needs to handle. But the hard question
emerges, how to handle!? suppress? limit? encourage? aren't all these
already based on a pre-conclusion that these are negative, bad,
therefore should be handled with suppression!?

I don't know. I feel I'm chasing my own tails.
So the conversation with Noah &mdash; the
F-word is one way to express that strong feeling you feel, but not the
only one. The consequence of using it can be a fight. So if you are
prepared to fight, go with it, the word itself is perfect fine as it
is because it expressed your feeling at the moment well (effective),
message clearly understood (no lost-in-translation), and will have
the intended result (fight) &mdash; man, if only projects at work can
be done as such!


So I think the trouble really begines when 
using it without anticipating (or secretly not wanting) 
the fight that may follow &larr; so again, it's the idea of getting
the benefit without paying a price makes it a _bad_ word.

See my point?
