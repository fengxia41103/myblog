  </div>

  <ol id="toc" class="row"></ol>

  <div>
    <div id="article-content">
      <p><p>I have seen this <a href="https://www.amazon.com/China-Witness-Voices-Silent-Generation/dp/0307388530">book</a> on Reader's Corner's shelf for sometime,
and never felt I should pick it up and read. The book didn't feel like
a kind of book I would like to read, "Personal interviews!?" I thought
ot myself, "that is a common cheap method to get some moving and
touching feeling to reader while the author/cook puts in nothing much
but to collect and compile them." That's my thought, like I always
look down on those army of real estate agents hovering around a condo
complex in China these days &larr; what they do own/contribute!?
anything!? They didn't own the unit, didn't even do much of a homework
to collect information of it. As a matter of fact, many of them
deliberately present you the <strong>wrong</strong> information so they can play a
scheme on you, like hooking you with a couple interesting one, one too
cheap for your budget and one too much over yours, so the strategy
predicts that you will then settle on the next one, the mid-range one,
that he is actually selling, which he already knew since the very
beginning. What the hell.</p>
<p>But then, I bought the book, read it, and felt deeply sad inside. Not
that those personal stories were interesting, probably remote, to my
experience. After all, that's a generation or two of which I had
little sense of, heard only some from my own family accounts through
dad and uncles, and had always felt distant, almost repulsed to
absorb, since that age of darkness was too heavy to think about, too
depressing to dig in, and don't we also secretly believe/hope that it
is not going to happen again anyway, so might as well not to burden
yourself with those information.</p>
<p>But then, there  was a clip or  two, that caught me to  think, to feel
disturbed, to  feel really really sad.  I wish there were  also hope I
felt. But  I have to  say there was much  more sadness than  any other
emotions. It's not a sadness of a lost love or a lost generation or of
their suffering. I can't describe what  it is, it is a profound anger,
perhaps, now to think of it, and  a feeling of sorry for that they had
to twisted and turned  and made the best out of what  they had (or was
given)  so  to survive,  yes,  just  survive, not  flourishing,  just,
survive.</p>
<p>Life is hard, for every single generation. There are always one or two
the <em>lucky</em>  ones, but  overall, it  is hard.  So religion  comes into
play, so  is any kind  of thing that gives  you comfort so  to balance
hardship. It's  funny that  even yesterday  when I  dropped Noah  at a
local Chinese church for his first, and mine too, Sunday school, and I
was dragged into a newbie session in which a senior member (I guess he
is, though I  have no clue how  the ranking system works  in a church)
was discussing w/ three  of us (two were a couple  and the woman works
at Lenovo,  too!), and her  question was, religion is  probably needed
because  people need  something  to help  go  through life's  hardtime
&rarr; a psychological need.</p>
<p>On the one hand, I think everybody would just agree w/ her point,
because this is such a universal ask. On the other hand, I also feel
seeking it is then a challenge, if not a impossibility, because there
are so many to choose from (and doesn't each one clams they are the
true one, while others are just plain false!?), but without a
reference, how can one choose? Oh well. I'll leave this to another
discussion later.</p>
<p>Here, I want to jog down a few sections from this book, which, while
reading them, gave me a moment of, silence.</p>
<h1>Page 199, "Tea houses and news singers"</h1>
<blockquote>
<p>Sitting opposite Old Mr Wu, the "written complaint" he had paid
someone to write on his behalf clutched in my hands, my heart
ached. These peasants who thought that young Westerners in fashionable
"begging jeans" were poor, and that doing hard, ill-regarded labour in
the city was to "enjoy life and make big money", did not even have the
basic information or understanding they needed to live in the same
era. But they had never made demands for a better life ot the rich and
powerful who requsitioned them into bankruptcy. Yet those "mother and
father officials" who have survived until today only because the
peasants kept to their work instead of throwing down their hoes to
make revolution and class struggle apparently never paused in their
daily banquets to consider the price the peasants have paid with their
blook and sweat.</p>
<p>China's peasants have been treated as a part of the 10,000 things of
nature, a group that nobody notices. People are concerned about the
melting of the ice caps, they fret over the disappearance of the Asian
tigers, they fume at the desert swallowing up the green lands, they
even have interminable discussions over the right combination of
vitamins ofr every dish of food. But how man people are calling out
for an improvement in the living conditions of the Chinese peasants?
How many people pause to consider the bowls of weak vegetable soup in
China's poverty-stricken villages, with just a few grains of rice
added to stave off hunger? How many people would go to read a story
like "The Gourd Children" or "The Monkey King" to the children of poor
farmers who don't even know which end to open a book at or where to
start reading from on the page, so that those hearts, whose first
awareness was of days and nights of hunger, cold and disease, can have
their share of goals and beautiful memories like the rest of us? How
many people realise that helping those poverty-stricken, uneducated
peasants begins with wresting power from local officials who in turn
have no education and simply do not understand the law?</p>
<p>China has become strong, China has stood up, but we cannot stand on
the shoulders of the peasants for the world to admire how tall we
are. We cannot let the peasants' blood and sweat water the tree of our
national pride.

<p><em>&mdash; Train from Nanjing to Shanghai, 7 May 2007:</em></p>
<p>GIRL A: How do you know that your dad has a lover?</p>
<p>GIRL B: I bumped into them, yuck, they were all over each other.</p>
<p>GIRL A: Did you tell your mum?</p>
<p>GIRL B: What would be the point? She said it herself a long time ago,
all men eat what's in their bowl while eyeing up what's in the wok!</p>
<p>GIRL A: Not necessarily, not my dad.</p>
<p>GIRL B: That's because you don't know. My mum says, what man with
money doesn't keep a mistress these days?</p>
<p>GIRL A: So what're we going to do when we have men?</p>
<p>GIRL B: If they can keep lovers, so can we!

<p><em>&mdash; Ladies' toilets, Shanghai Hongqiao Domestic Airport, 11 May
2007:</em></p>
<p>MANAER: Why is this paper dispense so loose?</p>
<p>CLEANER: I thought that it would make it more convenient for the
customers.</p>
<p>MANAGER: You can't do that, it has to be tight, or it's easy for the
customers to pull out a lot all at once, and we're the ones who have
to pay for it. Have you wiped down all the pictures?</p>
<p>CLEANER: Yes, all of them, even the new ones they've just hung
up. It's just that one over the soap dispenser, there's a mark on the
man's face, I can't get it off.</p>
<p>MANAGER: Don't you srub that off, I put that tape over the man's eyes
myself. Whatever were they were thinking of, hanging a picture of a
man in a ladies' toilet? How come the floor in that cubicle isn't
shiny?</p>
<p>CLEANER: I've just mopped it.</p>
<p>MANAGER: Not hard enough, you should mop the floor until you can see
the face of the person in the next toilet!

<p><em>&mdash; Zhengda Shopping Center, Shanghai, 12 May 2007:</em></p>
<p>YOUNG WOMAN: This bran's no good!</p>
<p>YOUNG MAN: It looks really great on you.</p>
<p>YOUNG WOMAN: What do you know about it? Nobody takes this brand
seriously. I'll crash and burn in the interview, for certain!</p>
<p>YOUNG MAN: Well, can't you wear that one from Next?</p>
<p>YOUNG WOMAN: That brand's too old-fashioned &mdash; as soon as the
boss sees it he'll know that I'm behind the times.</p>
<p>YOUNG MAN: Things are really expansive here, and money's tight for me
this month.</p>
<p>YOUNG WOMAN: So do you really love me?</p>
<p>YOUNG MAN: Of course I love you!</p>
<p>YOUNG WOMAN: Do you? Then you couldn't let me show up in the clothes
that aren't even brand names and lose face in front of a foreign
boss, now, could you?
</p>

<h1>Page 417</h1>
<p>Closing paragraphs.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>These voices mostly come from the younger generation, I guess, because
most of their parents and grandparents don't know how to use a
computer &mdash; they are a generation who know, instead, of civil
war, political madness, and queuing for food. In seeing those young
Chinese united in such a way, in their care, their outrage and
national pride, I realise I may be wrong about them. I used to think
that they were too comfortable and too rich to understand China's
hungry past, or those poor, uneducated peasants and the misunderstood
last generations.</p>
<p>All of this made me think of that song "Dyed with my Blood", again:
why does the national flag have to be painted with Chinese blood? I
pray for my motherland &mdash; I hope there will be peasce and
strength, rooted in love and happy families, and with friends around
the world.</p>
