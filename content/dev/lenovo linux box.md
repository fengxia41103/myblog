Instructions to get Ubuntu 16.04 (or any Linux) as your laptop OS.

# Install Linux

You can do a dual boot or just wipe the whole disk. Window's boot
manager will interfere, somehow, which I don't remember the details
anymore. Google it. Eventually it will work. The rest assumes you have
Linux installed.

# VPN

Most importantly, you need VPN.

1. Go to `otp.lenovo.com` to register your phone number.
2. Install `Lenovo OTP` from your app store.
3. Keep `Lenovo OTP` app running so you can see the active OTP.
4. `apt install openconnect screen`
5. In a screen, `sudo openconnect -u [username] webvpn.us.lenovo.com`

    1. first password: your regular domain login pwd
    2. second one: OTP
   
    If works, you should see something like this:
    <pre class="brush:plain;">
    root@fengxia-lenovo:~# openconnect -u fxia1 webvpn.us.lenovo.com
    POST https://webvpn.us.lenovo.com/
