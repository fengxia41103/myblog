Sitting on the porch going through the photos of today's xmas
parade. Cool weather, 60s, quite comfortable. Cloud gathering, but the
sunset are still shining through cracks here and there. Listening to
this [youtube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wXLjjIi_2GM), Nagoya,
the temple which I wondered into in 2016. All of sudden the memory
dragged me back into time, 2016, the year I still had a home in
Shanghai, with you near by. Today's your birthday. Happy birthday, 美
丽的人, as always, wish the best to you, for having a good time in
life, wherever you are, whatever you do, and whomever you are with.

2023 has been, a year of closure. With settling Dad in April, I
finally felt I could let go a weight on my mind, not that I had wished
his passing, but that I had finally made the trip home, to take care
of him. I hope what I did, the trip to Nanjing, the simple session
that only our closest family attended, would have been the way he
wanted to, to leave this world, finally. Like Coco, he is still
remembered, at least by me, so he is not yet vanishing, just that he
is now living in a different place, hopefully a better one than this
version of the world.

The music is touching. I remember the night I wondered back to the
temple, watching the sky, watching the people walking by, thinking of
my life and you, thinking of what was ahead of me... nothing could
have prepared me for the following years. From time to time I so
regret I let go your hand. But then, I reminded myself that even
though company would have been what I should have given you, letting
you fly is a better way, you are so young, so beautiful, so full of
possibilities, tied down with an old guy like me would have been
selfish. I would have had a good time, but in the end, you would
shoulder much of the burden I have had, and would possibly have in the
future, too. And to the end, I myself would become a burden to you. I
don't want it. I don't want to be a weight on you. Go fly, enjoy. Life
is a journey. Though I know the journey is tough and unpleasant, but
taking away the chance to experience it would be too selfish a thing
for me to do. When you are tired, beaten by life perhaps, want a way
out, here this place would be, a hide-out, that you would be able to
hide from this world, having all the comfort still, but could be
alone, by yourself, and like what I am doing right now, sitting on
this porch, watching the sky change, watching the cloud gathering,
watching the sunrise and sunset, and do you know that sunsets around
your birthday are always, always, so breathtaking!? I always feel
it's a sign, a destiny, that you were born at this time of the year,
that the evening has the best hue, just like you, being the most
beautiful in this world. So it is, meant to be.

Happy birthday.

Starting a new job on Monday. It feel that a chapter of my life is
being closed. Not that the new job would be that much different from
what I have had all along. But now with Dad passed away, myself moving
into a new job, I feel the age of 50 a beginning of some sort of
life. I don't know what lies ahead of me. Actually I don't even have
much thought or hope that how old I could eventually become. Maybe
it's truly a sign of depression, that I feel I could leave this world
at any moment. Like the podcase I listened, I don't regret coming into
this world, I had my fun. But I don't mind leaving now, either. It's
enough. I don't want to experience more, pain or merry, I have seen
them. I have loved, have lost my heart and my soul, have known what a
beauty is, what a kindness is, what all the good things this world
could offer are like. That's good enough for me. I may feel worried
about Noah, or any life of whom I may feel I could still offer
something, but in the end I know I did the best I know how. I won't be
able to accompany them till the end, so they will be on their own,
eventually. I wish all the best luck, as I am wishing for you, and
thank you for coming to my life! I love you, all.
