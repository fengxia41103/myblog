Slug: can you innovate

This has been a topic on my mind for quite some time now ever since I
worked in Shanghai in 2016 and witnessed things that quite annoyed me,
especially from a software engineer prospective. 

So the backdrop is that Chinese people have been encouraged by
the country's phenomenal success in economy and are now moving from _made in
china_ to _created in china_ &mdash; a sound idea, just like
_socialism_ or any other idea someone around the corner has. The
idea is not the problem, the implementer is.

Ideas are cheap. There is a problem xyz, easy. The challenge is how we
are gonna find a solution for this problem, let alone a _satisfactory_
one? Well, no one can really define that. Even when you talk about a
_working_ solution, the immediate argument will be what you mean by
_working_? How do you prove it works? This sounds more and more like
an attorney's job now, doesn't it? Well, let's leave this
philosophical dilemma and rant about why I was annoyed by this
innovation wave.

# Buzz words

First, loading buzz words is not innovation.  These days just walking
into any coffee shop in Shanghai and locate any group of:

1. more than 2 people (2 is more likely love birds chatting), 
2. age band between 20-40
3. using laptop instead of smart phone or tablet
4. bonus: it's running a PPT
5. super bonus: it's running code

Yes, you have just found Latte entrepreneurs. Get a cup
of coffee and eavesdrop for a while, the buzz words are bound to flow
with full strength: `cloud computing`, `big data`, `sharing economy`,
`amazon`, `google`, `BAT`, `R` ... nowadays one should also add `AI`.
Whatever the problem is, or even the solution might be,
these are the most common denominators.

I really shouldn't bash these ppl. After all they are thinking, and
trying to create a solution. But I was deeply annoyed because &mdash; <span
class="myhighlight">these are not solutions</span>. These are buzz
words that anyone can pick up from a blog or a chat forum. They are
window dressers that makes a content pretty and looks more
sophisticated than it is. But do you understand what they are really
about? Let's say _cloud computing_. Why cloud? what make a cloud? Yes
there is the [NIST definition][1], but that doesn't really mean
anything to me if you can't relate it to your own context (the problem
we are to solve) and explain (clearly):

1. what will a cloud be used for
2. how it is going to help
3. which layer is going to help, and
4. how that decision was made

To the minimum, if you are thinking that building a cloud is more of a
HW investment than SW, then you don't know what you are talking
about. If you are to rent from AWS, then can you tell me what cost you
are to bear in exchange for its service (and I can tell you now it is
not just money... no, not data security, nor privacy, nor vendor lock
in... these are all valid points, but the real bummer, is the learning
curve). <span class="myhighlight">Yes, people, brain</span>.  That
will be the hardest asset to come by, and the most valuable in your
org. AWS is a wonderful service. It is a Ferrari with a million
dials. The magic word _cloud computing_ is not going to just spit out
a solution for you. It will help, dramatically, if you know how to
tune those dials, properly.

Man! I can't tell you how many times I had to battle
some Chinese IT fella in 2015 who wanted to sell his client
an Oracle database (the swiss army knife of DB) but
failed to come up a single example of which feature of the Oracle is
needed in his application, and why alternatives are inferior? Come
one! if you are too lazy or just not good enough to set up an
apple-to-apple evaluation, then all what you are saying about the
wonderful things Oracle can do, are just a word-of-mouth speculation.

# Domain knowledge

The reason they took the buzz words as solution itself is that they
are taking an easy way out &mdash; a sounded cure-fore-all instead of
acquiring, analyzing and proving **domain knowledge**:

1. How much do you really know the problem?  and the context of the
problem? 
2. What's the assumption you are taking to think of this as a problem?
3. What method you used to analyze the cause of this problem? 
4. How do you support your argument? and how sound is your support, both qualitatively and quantitatively?

My problem is that many conversations I
have participated all went with roughly 30-min of discussion of the
problem and rest of life for the grand future of the "what if we get
10% of the 13-billion population using this!?" How exciting! Of
course, even selling a million toilet paper is an exciting business,
and if you can figure out to sell them by the piece instead of roll,
man, you will be a legend for sure.

Analyzing something is hard. As a matter of fact, any learning is
hard. To understand the problem is the hardest part, if not the only
thing it matters in an innovation. Too often, the tool becomes the
solution. Like the old saying, when you only have a hammer, every
problem starts to look like a nail. Most of us would consider
ourselves a domain expert of something. The quick measure I would
suggest is how much time you have spent in that domain. Time doesn't
cheat, and practice makes one perfect. So if the conversation on the
_problem_ only lasts for 30 minutes and consensus is reached, it is a
clear sign that the analysis is too superficial, and likely too
wrong. If one really respects the word _innovation_, do your
homework. If it takes 3 years for a highschool and a 4 years for a
college, this _big_ problem to solve can not be easier than that.

And last, debate. The more debates and splitted views there are, the
more likely you are truly sitting on something worth solving.
Arguing with smart brains is not only fun, but a great way to progress
analysis and get closer to the core of that domain.

# Disruptive, not

<figure class="col l6 m6 s12">

A byproduct of China's economy miracle is an impatience to realize a
dream. Even worse, urban legends encourage one to be _disruptive_,
because, just look around, how many new riches found their fortune by
disrupting the traditional course with their ignorance and ego alone!
The mentality of _nothing is impossible_ is not a slogan, it's a
common sense.


But no, innovation is not, and can not be, disruptive. We have argued
innovation is rooted in domain knowledge, and that knowledge forms the
food chain we see today, which in turn brew the perceived
problem. The instinct of redrawing the map to remove that problem is
absolutely correct &mdash; it's like taking fish out of its tank. It
will die. But the new map will have its own quirks, just you haven't
seen them yet. So being disruptive is nothing but replacing the old, visible
problems with a promise while repeating "no
problem no problem no problem..." to your covered ears.

Innovation is not magic. It can only be a system with feedback loop
that can be continuously tuned. Like writing software, you always
started with a version 1, and ended up with version 989287429 after
that many iterations of trial-and-error. If you ignore (or downplay)
the intermediates, viola, your end result looks absolutely
**innovative**!  Think about Newton's apple, or Einstein's, or Google,
or Amazon, great arts, or any disruptive technology/solution you have
in mind, just look closer, read and research, you will find
breadcrumbs all over its path. The last push gets all the glory, but
the truth is that it's standing on the shoulder of a giant, and the
ladder to climb is the spirals of continuous try-measure-tune-repeat.

Yes I'm a tech guy and am on a _perpetual_ learning curve of some new
or unfamiliar technologies. When a growing age, I found myself even
constantly on a review session of some old technologies &mdash; a
command line I can't think of anymore after a couple month, a Python
syntax that now eludes me and I have to google it &mdash; this is not
even stackoverflow because SO is used only when I can ask a question
that has passed Python 101. I'm talking about _google python built-in
function_ type of basics. Shame. But there are just so many
technologies that one has to know in order to piece all them together
somehow to make your stuff work. So to me I'm constantly learning,
constantly thinking, constantly re-inventing wheels or copying someone
else's wheels, and constantly writing something **new** and **fresh**
that only my brain is producing. _Is this innovation?_
