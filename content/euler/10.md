[code][2].

* **problem space**: `int < 2000,000`
* **test criteria**: is prime?

Easiest approach is to find all primes under 2,000,000 and add them up.

```python
def get_primes(n):
    i = 1
    while i <= n:
        if is_prime(i):
            yield i
        i += 1

def main():
    n = 2000000
    print sum(get_primes(n))
```

## primality test

This topic is not easy. My implementation is so called **naive**
version because it is simple to understand but does not scale well
when testing large number.

```python
def is_prime(n):
    """Test function if a given number is prime.

    Argument:
    :n: number to test

    Return:
    :Boolean: true if n is prime
    """
    if n <= 1:
        return False
    elif n <= 3:
        return True
    elif n % 2 == 0 or n % 3 == 0:
        return False

    i = 5
    while i * i <= n:
        if n % i == 0 or n % (i + 2) == 0:
            return False
        i += 6
    return True

```

## get primes up to N

My implementation is, well, not creative nor fast. This version, found
in [here][4], is a much nicer version, even though I don't fully
understand this yet.

```python
from itertools import ifilter
from math import sqrt


def primes_up_to(n):
    """Generates all primes less than n."""
    if n <= 2:
        return
    yield 2
    F = [True] * n
    seq1 = xrange(3, int(sqrt(n)) + 1, 2)
    seq2 = xrange(seq1[-1] + 2, n, 2)
    for p in ifilter(F.__getitem__, seq1):
        yield p
        for q in xrange(p * p, n, 2 * p):
            F[q] = False
    for p in ifilter(F.__getitem__, seq2):
        yield p
```

To find all primes under 1,000,000, performance comparison:

1. my naive version: 3.1s
2. this version: 0.14s

However, this version suffers by using `F` to maintain the
sieve. For a large `n` (> long long in C), Python will complain with
an error!

From [here][3], I got a couple nice ones.

### a one liner to get primes under N

```python
def primes_oneliner(N):
    aux = {  }
    return [aux.setdefault(p, p) for p in range(2, N)
            if 0 not in [p%d for d in aux if p>=d+d]]
```

### prime generator

```python
import itertools
def erat2( ):
    D = {  }
    yield 2
    for q in itertools.islice(itertools.count(3), 0, None, 2):
        p = D.pop(q, None)
        if p is None:
            D[q*q] = q
            yield q
        else:
            x = p + q
            while x in D or not (x&1):
                x += p
            D[x] = p
```

### get primes up to N

```python
def primes_less_than(N):
    # make `primes' a list of known primes < N
    primes = [x for x in (2, 3, 5, 7, 11, 13) if x < N]
    if N <= 17: return primes
    # candidate primes are all odd numbers less than N and over 15,
    # not divisible by the first few known primes, in descending order
    candidates = [x for x in xrange((N-2)|1, 15, -2)
                  if x % 3 and x % 5 and x % 7 and x % 11 and x % 13]
    # make `top' the biggest number that we must check for compositeness
    top = int(N ** 0.5)
    while (top+1)*(top+1) <= N:
        top += 1
    # main loop, weeding out non-primes among the remaining candidates
    while True:
        # get the smallest candidate: it must be a prime
        p = candidates.pop( )
        primes.append(p)
        if p > top:
            break
        # remove all candidates which are divisible by the newfound prime
        candidates = filter(p._ _rmod_ _, candidates)
    # all remaining candidates are prime, add them (in ascending order)
    candidates.reverse( )
    primes.extend(candidates)
    return primes
