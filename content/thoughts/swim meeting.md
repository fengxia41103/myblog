It's a strange feeling that you got a text from a total stranger, and
it turned out we could chat like old friends as if there is indeed a
parallel universe and somehow we connected. She is a very pretty
person, and I sincerely wish she has a beautiful life, also. Maybe one
day we will meet in person, but it indeed feels like a destiny of some
sort.

Taking Noah to his swim meet today. I don't know what happened to the
sweet boy I know. I don't think I am doing a good job now as a dad,
and I don't think she is doing a good job as mom, either. He turned
into a person that is constantly unhappy, and is actively avoiding
me. I don't know what I did that is turning him away. There must be
something. But this feeling is annoying on my part. I hate to show up
at his door only to see him unhappy and unwilling to see me. I wish my
being there would be viewed as a good thing, not that I get up early
in the morning just to frustrate him. The quirky thing is that he
isn't happy either when being with his mom. So, what is going on? Once
a while we get a nice conversation, usually after his swim training,
as if he has let out all the steams in the training, now could be more
relaxed and have a talk. I cherish those moments. But still, I wish
him happy, w/ or w/o me. If me staying away is the key, then be
it. But so far I think himself is confused, and he doesn't know what
makes him happy at all, so just venting on me as if I were the
fault. Oh well.

Swim meet is a thing of joy. It's like a town party. Even kids are
walking in w/ a lawn chair as if they are going to a picnic. And
watching these little ones kicking and splashing is simply, wonderful!
What a beautiful thing life is! Being young and healthy and full of
energy. Sometimes I feel life is indeed short, that the best years of
your life are only that many, and they just fly by. Then you start the
looooong years of being old, being weak, being not of your top form,
and only watching yourself deteriorating day by day, and what an agony
that is! I know these kids don't know that yet. It is a fate of human
nature that you would realize only when it is there no more. I guess
this also speaks of the theory we learned in finance that a loss hurts
more than a gain does for the joy. So the feeling of a loss is etched
deeper. This also explains that Dad was relating all the unpleasant
memories even then he had lost all the chain of reasoning. So safe to
bet that sweet memories are far and between, if any left in the end,
whereas bitter memories stay. What a pity.
