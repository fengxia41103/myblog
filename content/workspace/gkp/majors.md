Majors are split into three layers: category, subcategory,
and majors. Our data covers
all 32 categories and 171 subcategories that are officially recoganized,
and 1,663 majors either defined by government or by school.

## Category and subcategory

Department of Education defines 32 categories and 171 subcategories.
Similar to school research at _State level_, here I have focused on statistics
so to provide a birdeye view of majors and schools.

Students can quickly browse through category and subcategory to locate
area of interest she wants to drill further down.

## Major

Besides text description of a major, the application has built
integration point with popular job posting sites so it can display
the most recent 50 job posts that matches this major. A _job title
keyword cloud_ shows the titles used by employer. This helps student
to understand what type of job will be relevant to this major.

Also, posts are grouped by its location(city) so that gives
student another reference point when choosing major.
