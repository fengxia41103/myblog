I would not have thought the word 苏州 had popped up in the headline
news because of such a
[tragedy](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jjDcXXNjWU0). But the
aftermath of many netizen comments is really what I want to talk
about here.

It's quite common that the act of this woman being painted as a
savior of a national pride, which, regardless my disagreement of the
comment itself, is also implying that the pride is in a decline in
recent times. Thus, a heroic event such as this became a counter argument
of such decline, saying that not all are lost, not all are bad people,
and there are still good eggs left, which usually also implying that
majority of _us_ are the good eggs.

However, this is a flawed logic. Period. The act of this person proved
one thing, and one thing alone, that she was a hero. She, herself, no
one else but herself, was a good egg. She had no intention to
represent anyone else, nor she had any obligation, or right, to
represent anyone other than herself. This statement holds true to
everyone of us here. The comment seems elevating her to a height as if
bestowing a glory. Further, it even carried a tone that a commoner as
such is now being recognized on a stage, which, as the rule if not the
law, is reserved only to the privilege, because being on this stage
can only be allowed if some highup gives the nod.

What a nonsense!

This so called glory is not a glory at all. This praise is not a
praise for the mere reason that it is insincere, untrue, and
unwanted. She did not ask for this, nor had consented being put on
such a stage. On the contrary, I'm certain that she didn't want this
tragedy to happen at all, let alone she paid the dearest price! What
is happening is that her body is being dragged out of peace, laying on
a platform under a spot light, words forced into **her own mouth**
so to back up a theory, a justification, an evidence, while none of
these had previously paid slightest attention of her!

What a shameful play! This is not a glory you are awarding her! This,
is killing her twice! thrice!

What will happen to her tragedy then after this five minute of fame?
Flushed away just like another piece of toilet paper that had wiped
some shit off the dirty ass. Shame. Total, shame.

Stop linking her to those political BS, those nationalistic BS, those
cultural, historical BS. Her heroism has nothing to do w/ stopping the
decline of the national pride, of proving that Chinese still have
moral left, of having still some good eggs left. Stop using her to
wipe clean anyone's ass, mine included. Each of us is an
individual. I'm responsible for my own behavior, my own decision, my
own judgment, not much of my own fate but I try, and my own
conscience. So should we all be. Only then, when we could look at
ourselves as such, and look at her as such, there is then a hope no
more nationalism, no more cultural revolution, no more stupidity, no
more manipulation, and no more such senseless tragedy.
