PY Consulting was founded in 2015 by a group of friends who share a
passion of technology and want to provide quality service to our
customers. We are specialized in building <span class="myhighlight">
prototypes of data-driven web application</span> using Python Django
framework and Material front end. Our key advantage is to achieve a
quick turn around from perceiving a concept to having a usable sandbox
environment. A typical cycle runs between 2 to 4 weeks, and in most
cases, your system will be up and running within one week.

From experience, we have come to realize that most _customers_ have a
fairly broad idea of what the solution will be like. Often enough they
have a certain _technology_ in mind they prefer to use. However, such
preference can be distracting.


First of all, engineers are hired to create a solution for you. It is
key that they could _internalize_ the problem first before forming
an implementation strategy.  Customer proposing a particular
technology is a good starting point by indicating their preference. It
is equally important to keep an open mind and be ready to discuss and
try alternative ways. Instead of hang up on which library or
programming language to use, focus on the problem &mdash; business
process, user roles, organizational layout, responsibility chart,
hidden assumptions, domain knowledge and constraints, management
expectation &mdash; only after the problem has been well understood
could one picks _the right tool_ for the job.


Secondly, each technology has pros and cons. This is a given.  We have
overcome quite some challenging learning curves and have become
skillful of certain toolsets, but they may not include the cool buzz
word everyone is talking about. In software design and development,
having a shallow knowledge a hot topic is easy; having sufficient
experience and insight to create a robust and efficient overall system
is hard. Knowing alphabet doesn't mean one can write a novel. System
nowadays requires a sound knowledge of the entire stack, which covers
at least half dozen languages &mdash; CSS, JS and HTML for frontend,
Python/Ruby/Javascript/Java/Go/.net for backend, and SQL/XML/JSON/YAML
for data persistence. Each of them has different syntax, style rules,
process to compile, build, test, and deploy. Not to mention for each
task there are another half dozen frameworks and libraries written in
that language to choose from. This chain can go on and on and on. I
always believe knowing your tool well is more important than using the
"best" tool half-baked.


So do us a favor,  check out the samples we have produced in the
past and documents that illustrated our design methdology and
toolchain, then decide whether our __toolset__ and __mindset__ fit
your preference.

We are constantly building up our toolbox with new technologies, new
tricks, best practices and such. But at the mean time, we are stubborn
old timers. We want to be convinced by a __real__ case in which our
existing toolbox can not handle the challenge _gracefully_ anymore
&mdash; we think this is the only way to evaluate how switching to a
new tool would help, by how much, what made the difference, and in
what situation it becomes useful.


We believe this is how we could deliver quality to our customer
&mdash; if going to a war, do you want to be with somebody who shoots
a bull's eye with a WWII rifle?  or someone who can operate a 21-st
century cutting-edge weapon but can not aim well?
