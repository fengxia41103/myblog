I'm finding myself battling my own perception these days, a
lot. Perception isn't a new topic to me. I have analyzed in [hurt
feeling][1] whether it is a reasonable action for Noah's mom to feel
hurt because of something I did, well, at least based on her
claim. But still, perception is such a fundamental thing of human,
that in this trip w/ Noah, and in the last few days when he and I were
both recovering from jetlag, this is the only thing I could think of
to reason how I had lost patience w/ him, and started to dislike more
and more of myself &rarr; perception, is the evil cause of all human
unhappiness.

Cambodia, and the image of that place, was constantly on my mind this
morning. Watched two documentaries yesterday &mdash; [save my
seoul][2], and one that talks about child trafficking in Siem Reap,
the city Noah and I just visited. And this morning Noah and I were
watching this really strange, and rather too realistic japanese movie
called _Happy Hour_, in which four female friends, all in their 30s,
are going through their life and struggles, like everyone of us on
this planet, real, dull, pain, and 无奈. Then, everytime when someone
cried in the screen, I could feel the emotion, if not touching and
bringing myself to tears, at least, it would feel awkward, that makes
you want to run away.

What is it? Why human, on one hand sooo deeply touched and connected
with another human being, even if the other one is only an image, a
virtual strange in a screen!? I don't know him/her, but I felt the
upset, the tide of emotion that this person is going through. Is this
sympathy? imagination? Is this the final link that keep us sane, that
deep down in our soul there is a connection to each other, however
remote we become, how ever far we drift apart, however different we
all are, there is a string of humanity holding us together?

But then, why human also act in the completly opposite way, that being
cruel to each other, indifferent, deceiving, even many times outwright
bullying and humiliating!? Why? and what makes one doing one more than
the other? Do we have all have both sides on us, just that social
rule, education, self-discipline, and any other random idea that comes
across my path, that reins me from being the bad one? Well, isn't also
these _random idea_ that defines what is good and what is bad? So they
are their own judge and you are being put in a race one couldn't win!?

What is it? Why can someone achieve such a noble thing, like the guy in the
[The Last Samurai][3] who has such a firm belief in their cause, and
acted with their soul and heart? and at the same time, someone who
tramped on everything to get his gain, but justified just the same?

The guy in this _Happy Hour_ movie who is divorcing one of the
women. He is a _rigid_ scientist, but honestly I couldn't see what is
_bad_ about him &mdash; and yet, all the women seem to _see through_
him and criticized him for being cold and impossible to live with! I
don't understand their POV, but I'm sure they have a point, otherwise,
why they say and act so uniformly, and being full confidence in their
statement? &larr; I'm not one who can be convinced easily. But I would
admit their conclusion even though I don't understand a bit of how
they derived their points.

How bizarre! Then Noah got up really early in morning, partly due to
his jetlag, partly because he could watch TV. I told him that he was a
good boy at Taikang because there were night shift staff entertain him
if he got up early. So being fair, it was really just **my
perception** of him being a good boy because I didn't have to get up
w/ him and keep him entertained! So really, his being good or bad is
nothing but a result of my own's condition &rarr; when I'm well rested
and lighthearted, I find him pleasant, smart, **the best travel
buddy** to have; then, I'm tired, grumpy, occupied by memory and
criticism of his mom's handling of him, I put on a negative lens... So
in the end, he has always been, him; it's me who has shifted from one
end of the happiness spectrum to the other, and venting my frustration
and annoyance on him, and this, **is what I'm battling w/ &mdash; my
own perception**.

So in the end, one is the enemy of his/her own. It is not bipolar; it
is nature. Like what I'm convinced that one's weakness is bound to be
the strength, I'm also convinced, that what I'm feeling is not only
natural, but insolvable. I can only feel and sense this world through
perception. It is the only way to function and react. Yet, it is also
the thing that creates an emotion in you, that makes this world an
unhappy place, and myself an unpleasant person to be.

Cursed.
