If you are looking for a candidate with strong software development
experience and research capability solving complex
problems, look no further.

I have been doing software development for over 20 years. I am a
full-stack developer including infrastructure and DevOps. I am
familiar with nearly all domains of a software system, both from
technology aspect and from development life cycle aspect. In one
project at Lenovo I was the UI lead responsible to deliver work in
Angular and React.  In another project there I was the team lead
working in Python Django, Ansible and Helm. At Lucidum, I wrote code
for React frontend, Java Sprint backend, Python for machine learning
and data API integration, Selenium and Cypress for e2e testing, Groovy
for Jenkins, Terraform for IaC. I was also designated the primary code
reviewer responsible for all PRs across 50+ GitHub
repositories. Working at UNC School of Medicine I created their first
Docker deployment in production, and was a main driver of their DevOps
projects.

I'm good at approaching challenges when no solution has yet to be
found. I was a seeding member of Lenovo's cloud-computing research
team. We were to create a solution for data center market from the
ground up. In that period I published two Reference Architecture paper
on Lenovo's website, worked with a team of 12 engineers on prototype
and refinement. One of these designs became "Lenovo Open Cloud
Automation" (LOCA), the first cloud-computing software offering by the
company. It was featured in Mobile World Conference 2019 in Barcelona,
and won a substantial commercial contract.

In 2020 I worked with a medical researcher at Mass General
Hospital. His research team at the time were strugglling to use two
opensource software, both written in Python. By then they had spent
weeks to get them run on their lab servers without success. I was able
to Dockerize these two projects over a weekend, unblocking the team so
that they could focus on their research whereas their expertise. This
experience prompted me to take interest in research and academic
environment where I could help similar cases. In these places projects
are often research oriented, laying a foundation work for the
future. They may not bring immediate commercial rewards, but they have
a long term impact. Therefore, when I saw this position, I feel this
is a perfect fit for both my skills and my interest.

I am confident that there are much value I will bring to this
position. I will be looking forward to having an opportunity to engage
a discussion, and exploring how I can contribute to move the needle
forward. Please do not hesitate to reach out.
