[This][1] is pretty amazing &mdash; "Google killed 2.3 billion ‘bad
ads’ in 2018, down 28% from 2017". I'm thinking the sheer number and
complexity involves to make detection, and to take action against
these 2.3 billion bad Ads. This is an absolute tech challenge, not to
mention the principle that drives such intention, and the
willingness to put down something like this to cleanse oneself.

I know Google has always had the [Don't be evil][2] motto, which I
found quite impressive when first heard of it. This is hard. I mean,
this is an ambiguous term &mdash; what is evil? who be the judge? and
what should you do about it? Google's number revenue is still its Ads,
and yet this 2.3B bad ads are not just noises, but toxics that will
pollute the market, and thus killing its cash source. So you could
argue that Google has every incentive to take this action.

But this faces the exact same question raised &mdash; who determines
good or bad? and if we take it into the free-market argument, wouldn't
the free market force distill these bad guys because they will not get
enough business, and will then be phased out? Apparently, the
Internet, or the Google's Ad market, is telling us otherwise &rarr;
the free market force is not sufficient to self regulate its own
health &larr; it simply can not keep up with the number of bad guys
who are equally creative and smart, and have stronger motivation to
game the system for advantage. The only defense is an arms race
&mdash; that by putting a clear policy upfront as requirement to
participate in this market, and an efficient police force to monitor
and rule out violations.

We used to scold these 城管 because they have absolute power over
under-powered street peddlers, and as Acton said, "Power corrupts;
absolute power corrupts absolutly", this is inevitable. However, it is
unclear either alternative is a better picture. We are assuming street
peddlers are morally sounder than these 城管 due to their
weakness. Of course, this is not true &mdash; an averaged distribution
of demographics is more likely to be true than false among these
population, or any group, if no other data to back it up. Further,
even if this is true, it says nothing about the shift of such _high_
moral standard once they are granted w/ more power! As a matter of
fact, history has proven too many times that what corrupts a person is
exact the transition from a low position to a high position.

So, what other options? Police force? I hate this idea, but this logic
seems to be the conclusion we are drawing &larr; if you can't
discipline yourself, then an external force must be introduced. Call
it police, or whatever you want, but that doesn't change the nature of
this force, nor why it was introduced at first place.

Then, what about this force now being granted with absolute power?
Isn't it the 城管 we just mentioned? or an authoritarian regime? I
mean, it can take many forms, but ingredient maintains. I don't think
I will like that at all. I don't think this is even the debate of
democracy vs. non-democracy. This is a paradox of how to main order.

We all agree we want to maintain order. I just argued that we can't
self-discipline sufficiently to avoid a police force. I'm worried
police force gains absolute power. Then what? A police of a police?
then another layer on top? and on and on and on.

I really should read Alice in Wonderland. Now everywhere I turn, every
topic I write, seems to be an analogy of an endless rabbit hole. Maybe
it's my analytical thinking is the problem &mdash; just too dumb to
figure it out, but too smart to be content with ignorance.

It's the dilemma of me &mdash; caught in between, not alive, not
dead.
