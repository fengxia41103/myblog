Saw an article on 知乎 the other day, titled [外国网友问：“为什么中国
禁了西方科技公司，却不满华为被禁？”][2]. The content is pretty obvious
to guess then. Browsed the comments and I suppose author's responses
here and there, I got quite, concerned a view held by the article that
there is a difference between the Chinese ban of Google (to be more
precise, Google was not banned, but it chose not to conduct business
anymore _voluntarily_), and the ban of Huawei &mdash; China set up a
house rule, say, censorship, that applies to anyone conducting in his
realm, so it is an objective law regulating everyone, not just
Google. If you don't like it, I don't like you either. But US, on the
other hand, is actively talking to his _allies_ using carrots and
clubs to ban Huawei, with, according to the popular view, the sole
objective to choke Huawei, thus China, to death.

There is a logical fallacy, I think, in this argument, because house
rule itself does not justify its, fairness. As a matter of fact, the
definition of a house rule is **exactly the opposite** to fairness
&mdash; using the house door as a virtual or physical threshold, a
house rule deliberately spell out that there are now two camps of
human in this world, those inside this house, and those outside this
house. Therefore, it is the exact definition of a segregation. Even
worse, it is a segregation based on any arbitrary criteria the house
owner likes or dislikes. So **to discuss fairness within the scope of
a house rule is complete nonsense** because the root of a house rule
is a personal preference, while fairness is a thing that can only
exist beyond personal preference.

If China justifies its blocking Internet access to Google using the
house rule, wouldn't it also justify any business owner posting a sign
"<whatever racial or sexual identity> only"? I would hope that the
answer is No. So how is this difference from China's house rule?

Further, even if it is a law, well, like any other law, being it a law
in physics or a law in court, is subject to challenge. If there is a
single aspect of a law being fair, it is not its current content or
intention, but its readiness to be challenged, by anyone, literally,
anyone on this planet. Period. A law that presented itself as _absolute
right_, well, by history, is always a fallacy, a FALSE that does more
harm than help. While I'm writing this, Noah is having a Bible study
w/ two older kids from a local Chinese church over Zoom meeting. Even
as firm believe of their doctrine, they are not offended by Noah
posting all kinds of _bizzare_ questions regarding the Bible. That's
what this should be.

But,that's exactly there the fallacy the article's author has
committed &mdash; the Chinese house rule has been posted as an
unchallengable decree with a sole argument that "if you don't like it,
you are not welcomed here". What this really is not a house rule,
actually. On the contrary, it is still a belief system, an ideological
camp, that manifests the idea of 非我族类，其心必异, which then, leads
to one and only possible consequence, **intolerance**.

This, is another case in point I have said in other articles before,
that author such as this is a coward. S/he is afraid to admit the true
cause of such action is based on ideology, but instead, making it a
subject of law and order, so to give the idea a sense of neutrality
and objectivity. This is rather pathetic. Why am I so afraid of
admitting my belief in an ideology, and stand the fight and challenge
on that ground and that ground alone, if I feel confidence of my view
and my act? 

Even worse, in some of the responses it was positioned that house rule
was such in order to protect the people.. well, I have had enough
writing on [people][1], which to me is a huge neon sign of
fallacy. And is protected from what!? In a response it was asking why
then Stackoverflow is also not accessible. I know! When I was
traveling, it puzzles me that SO was not accessible, or was painfully
slow, for no apparent reason! What's there that is ideological!? I
mean, does using an API or a Python call harming the house in any
fashion? Arguably it can be, because it can be used to access harmful
information. But then, if the entire Internet is really just an
infinite pool of information, it becomes pointless then in this chain:
api &rarr; info &rarr; harmful belief &rarr; ban. So literally, this
becomes a ban on information itself. Dark age, isn't it?

Fallacy, like any other fallacy, fulfills itself, forever true, and
forever invincible. It is a heroic act to claim one's ideology/belief,
live to it, defend it; it's a cowardice to avoid the ideological
challenge, instead, keeping its followers by making them ignorant,
docile, and quiet. Is this fair? In a sense, yes, because all its
followers are treated the same way &mdash; a walking dead.
