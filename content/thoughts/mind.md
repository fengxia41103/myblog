Got a book and it is truly disturbing, [Rape of the Mind][1]. So the
mind manipulation has been developed to the point that is highly
refined, highly `scientific` (you know I always have reserve about
this particular word this days), highly systematic, and highly
predictable. And this is the really disturbing.

Like how I have analyzed my line of work, psychology has developed
framework and divided torture into phases that can be systematically
entered through means of physical torture, drug, mental confusion and
such. Therefore, all the brutality of torturing on the body isn't just
a pain to bear or to yield, but just one step towards a goal that the
initiator has a clear definition &mdash; in other words, he knows what
he is doing, the question is, if you are the one being tortured, do
you know what he is doing to you!?

Scary, isn't it!? Part of the book will be talking about mind
manipulation on the mass, which I have always wondered about. The
recent movie 芳华 made the talk of that bizarre age to the headline
again, which is often a cliche to my education and my generation, when
everybody kinda of shrug shoulder as if it was a bad dream and would
not happen again. Yeah, it was just a crazy time done by crazy
people. But always, I ask myself, was it? Was it just made possible
because of the all the crazy people over excited about their
communist future, or it was a demonstration of evil manipulation of
the mass, as what this book is talking about? If you were caught in a
bad dream, how do you know!? or you just can't know? If so, what's the
remedy? I think bad dream happens, so you can't eliminate it. Then
what? You get caught and destroyed by it? or is there a way to ID the
dream even while you are in it, like that spinning totem in the
Inception movie?

I never knew the word `brain wash` was invented by the Chinese
(according to the book author). Nonetheless, I firmly believe the act
and the thought of braining washing anyone, for however the purpose
and agenda, is evil. This come from my underline belief that if there
were one thing that is completly free in this world, it is the
mind, and to me, guarding its freedom is the last line of defense of
humanity. That's why I view the way internet is being blocked in China
as a pure act against humanity and society because it is artificially
controlling the input to your mind so to achieve a controllable output
&mdash; this is setup of a social lab, and I don't want to be in it.

But reading the western philosophy make this even worse. To some
views, the mind is not free, it doesn't even exist. We can be just in
the dream, and there is nothing wrong with that. Dream isn't an
illusion, and illusion isn't necessarily bad either. It's just, that.
Descarte's **I think therefore I am** is neither sufficient nor
correct, because it implies a causal relationship which he didn't
want, so he changed it to **I am, I exist**. How fascinating! I admire
these thinkers who made reasoning to explore these concepts. It
doesn't really matter which conclusion they have, I think the act of
thinking and reasoning is the cornerstone of humanity and being.

Sitting here watching Noah finally got to play his minecraft game, I
wonder, even it's a fantasy world he is building and is into at the
moment, he is creating (a fuzzy pixel house), a world of his own, 
that reflects what his mind has, his reasoning carries, and his like
prefers... however unreal this world is, it's a place he can feel, how
it is like being free.
