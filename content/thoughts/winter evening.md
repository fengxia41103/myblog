    Noah's Kumon arts... what can I say? It's rather funny to watch
    his arts, though he was distracted. But it's ok. He is doing well.

Another evening w/ beautiful sunset. It's has been the best decision
to live here, being able to look out the window and see such a
wonder. Noah is like my lucky star. Only with his instinct could we
have been so lucky. He's at mom's place today. Was thinking to join
him, but then was in the middle of getting netbox work the way I want,
so it became another evening just by myself.

The other day, Google photo prompted me a photo of Noah sitting on
horse back, and it was dated 2018, two years ago. Wow, I remember the
event, when he and I were visiting my dad, and we were invited for a
lunch in this fancy place by this rich son of my dad's neighbor. Both
his daughters and himself ride horses, and actually own horses. So for
the first time in his life, Noah got to sit on a horse. I told him
about the photo and how it makes me feel time flying by, and he said
he was actually scared at the moment because the horse looked HUGE. It
was, indeed, makes me wonder how soliders could have fought against
such a thing &mdash; just imagine when it was running towards, and you
were like an ant comparing to its size. Courage, I guess, and perhaps,
desperation.

Seeing that photo made me miss dad. I haven't been able to make the
yearly trip to see him due to Corvid. Unlikely this is be eased
anytime soon, even w/ vaccination. I can see him in Wechat group. He
is doing, as usual, but I dreamed about him quite often recently. I
don't feel anything is up yet. But it's an uneasy feeling.

A friend of mine shaved her head, like completely! Unbelievable!! and
it looks **awesome** on her! It's really cool, I have to say,
especially when woman does it. I guess it has this _wow_ effect not
only because she does look pretty cool in it, but because it's
unexpected. Maybe I'll shave mine also someday, just to feel,
different, I guess, and it's rather a statement, of something. But
right now, I don't have anything so strong and dear to claim. So not
yet, not yet.

Her shave actually reminded me again that woman met in Shenzhen, 萍姐.
I actually don't know her name, so just going by the sound. She was
not only shaved, but wearing only T string, like all the time!!! It
was just, strange! Then you could see, that guys around her, though
pretending to show respect, always had an eye wondering around her ass
for a peek. Dark, isn't it!? I know. It was just a weird scene when
she was around. I don't know her story, why she was taking that
style. Had some chats w/ her. I think she was fine, somehow mellow
even, but maybe just for her own protection that she wanted to show
strength that way, I guess.

Picked up a line from 袁游 the other day, not by 袁sir himself, but
one of his substitute, and that line annoyed the hell out of me. It
goes like this, "As you know there are roughly two types of
civilization (actually I think he meant `culture`, but here for
literal translation) &mdash; west and east. East is represented by
mostly China and Japan, and you know Japanese culture came from China,
therefore..." Out of the mouth of some 20 year old, though
knowledgeable he is, is totally disgusting. I think this is now
passing the symptom of [nationalism][1]. This is outright arrogant and
self-centered. Not only there are more than West and East, but within
East there are more than just China and Japan! I haven't traveled as
much as I wish, but trips to Cambodia showed me clearly how wonderful
their past has been! It's an incredible sight seeing the Ankor Wat,
the beautiful carvings on the wall and stones, so beautifully done. It
was totally breathtaking. And honestly, please, stop always linking
Japan to China as if they are a son born without talent and is still
stupid &mdash; this is as typical as some Chinese parents treating
their kids, that they think they will never grow up, never understand
much, and never good enough, _for the parents_! Bullshit! Japan may
borrowed a lot from China, but they have not only preserved history
better, but have developed and built many wonderful things based on
the learning. It will be totally bizarre if Newton's first grade
teacher said that regardless Newton's achievement, he still owed all
his to the teacher.

China has $$ to boast, but its mind is as inferior as days of Opium
war, unenlightened, and bogus.
