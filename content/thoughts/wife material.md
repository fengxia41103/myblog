Traveling reveals one thing to me. I don't know whether this is unique
to me, or it is common to many people, guys especially. I start to
realize that, regardless which space I am in, let's say, in a shuttle
bus, or a subway, or an airport, or a country like Cambodia, there are
always women, and among them, somehow, there is always one that you
will find attractive, like to look at a few more times. It's a
pleasant feeling, but also feels strange in a social context, that
feels like a pervert. But honestly, it just happens. I step into this
space, observe, start to be aware of people around me, then violla,
over there, there is this one person that you will just realize, that
she is good looking (in sense of relativity of course), and you want
to see more of her.

How interesting! I start to see this pattern over and over and over
again. Even while touring some random tourist site, there is always
someone that catches my eyes. Why? Is this a common thing for all male
animals, and what about females? Are they feeling the same way? I'm
really wondering that in a closed space of any kind, human will find a
mate. If so, I would only guess that this is really driven by
instinct, by some native builtin desire.

Or, is it just driven by loneliness, I wonder?
