From 4th grade class weekly message of 4/8/2018:

> Positivity Project News:
> 
> Starting Monday, we will begin learning about integrity. This is
> doing the right thing when nobody is watching. People with integrity
> practice what they preach and maintain a consistent pattern of
> behavior aligned with their values. They have the courage not to
> follow the crowd if it means going against their beliefs. Integrity
> is closely linked with the terms of honesty and authenticity. People
> with integrity tell the truth and have alignment in their thoughts,
> feelings, and behaviors.

Well said, isn't it?

Just came back from a long trip, I felt this piece described exactly
how I feel what China's current society lacks, integrity.

1. We had a red eye flight at 1:45am at Pudong airport. I was thinking
   to take the T line 9 &rarr; line 2, which on map gets to Pudong at
   last stop. I also know there is a switch on line 2, four stops
   earlier than the airport stop, that everyone needs to get off the
   line 2 train and transit to the other side of the platform for a
   smaller train (and this I never figured out why!? It's such a waste
   of traveller's time and energy, for the benefit of economy?
   energy!? for the few times I travelled on this line, the carts were
   ALWAYS packed! So it wasn't because only few people need to go to
   the airport thus why wasting precious subway space, and could get
   line 2 turn around quicklier that way, too &larr; sorry, not the
   case!)
   
   
    Anyway, so I looked up online for its schedule, and it was just
    [confusing][1]. That `Guanglan Road` stop was the trouble one. So I
    saw the extended weekend hour and it was passing midnight. So I
    thought this would just work since my flight is 1:45am. 
   
   
    For pure odds, Noah and I got off at Guanglan Road stop around
    10pm. Boy, just when we were getting off, a "shorter train" pulled
    into the platform on the other side, and everyone, I mean, the
    entire passenger who were on line 2, and I'm talking about like 60%
    full of the entire train set, started running to that train. I held
    Noah back since I figure, well, there would plenty train till
    midnight deadline. Then all of sudden, these swarm of people
    started evacuating from that train, and just disappeared! In
    between, there were a swamp of people asking whether you want a
    ride to airport &larr; those so called 黑车 (unauthourized taxi
    drivers). 

    There were actually staff on board that train, but no one explained
    anything! Finally when the entire crowd was completely gone, left
    with a few dumb-founded faces, like me and Noah, dragging luggages
    and had no idea what is this about, asked a staff, who calmly told
    us that `the last train to airport is 10pm` &rarr; so there is no
    more train! WTF!!?? Then why isn't there any sign, direction,
    guideline to tell all these passengers what to do!? and what the
    heck running line 2 to passing midnight and having midnight flight
    while a 4-stop of distance has to be cut off at a different,
    earlier hour!?? What's the rationale!?

    I guess there isn't any. And didn't the gov battle these
    unauthorized drivers for years!?? well well well, you have just
    created this **GIANT NEED** for their existence! and I would even
    say you not only created them, you actually encouraged them to be
    in service!! Otherwise, what are these passengers going to do!?
    Apparently you are not helping them for sure! You actually kicked
    them right into this pothole and watching them to figure it out
    completely on their own!!

    Geeeee......... this is just, **maddening**!!

2. Once we finally got the airport, for all its grandeur and cool
   looking, all terminal gates were shut! and every single passenger
   must enter this building from a single entrance! and it was windy,
   chilly, and regardless where you unboard your vehicle, you must
   walk to that entrance, and there is again, **NO SIGN**! .. well,
   there was a human sign &larr; they acutally put a poor girl
   standing there to tell all the confused faces "go to entrance
   number 24"... what for!!?? I really don't get it!!! and I can bet
   all doors would be open when the World Repo was holding here!
   
    Just ridiculous!
   
3. Then at custom, there was a **single window open** for poor
   foreigners! A single one! while citizen windows had like 10! and
   the guy who worked there was god damn slow! 
   
    I guess they just love us so much that they didn't want us to
    leave.

    What a service, and what a country!

And this, is exactly what **integrity** is about &larr; do things
based on your value, not on impressing someone for a good show! 

Well, I guess these are pretty telling what values this city/country
holds. So really, before you think you are getting back your historical
glory and be the center of universe again, I for one, will not want to
live in that universe at all, because **our value systems surely are
incompatible** as far as I can tell.

Peace.
