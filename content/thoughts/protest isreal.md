Beautiful weather. Went to the balcony after gym, and saw a gathering
of some sort at the church across street. Perfect to try some
photography! Was thinking to take Zf for a walk, but still felt
to take the Df instead.

A small section of the street was blocked by four policy cars, two on
each side. People were having their fun, food was served, DJ was
playing loud music. By the time I was walking across they were
inviting people to dance. Then by the time I walked around town and
came back passing this same spot, crowd had all gone home, stage was
cleared, and only some were putting stuff away, and a stack of folding
chairs standing there ready to be picked up.

I wouldn't have given it much thought if not because that earlier on
this walk I ran into a camp by chance, a camp of protesters on a lawn
on campus. Signs were put up says **Gaza**. Tents flattened like a
piece of floor mat lying on the ground everywhere. A couple young kids
were drawing using chalks on the brick walk which cut across the camp,
dividing it to two sides. Along this walk was a row of tables with
people standing behind. Turned out they were serving out food, drinks,
and I guess other necessities. More supplies seemed brought in, and a
group of them were sitting on the ground drawing or writing something
on a carboard size sign materials &mdash; the word "genocide" was,
everywhere, "divest", "no university", "stop", "13,800 ppl have been
killed", one kid dies every 10 min (or second?)....

I don't know. I was surprised that they were there, many looked, and
by the words on the sign referring to the "school", "UNC",
"university", I took many of them are UNC students. But why?

I don't understand. I heard on youtube yesterday that American
colleges are seeing escalation of this protest against Isreal w/ the
quote-&-quote "genocide". But I don't get this. Didn't they see the
beginning of all this, that Hamas raided that music festival, killing,
raping, shot on video, showed off to the world, as if they were on a
celebration!? So, what do they expect? Just walks away from all these,
crimes, crimes against humanity, crimes against the very word
**peace** that these protesters are using, crimes against their own
family, friends, neighbours, classmates, strangers who share the same
living space so called Gaza. How could these students fold their eyes
on this? Is Isreal really _over-reacting_ when Hamas built their
bunkers, tunnels, camouflaged using a hospital, a school? Can the
people who works there claim _innocent_ that they didn't know? If they
did know, what else do they think will happen? They are innocent in
the sense of action, but not in the sense of knowing, and in the end,
tolerating.

Gaza and its residents tolerated the existence of this extreme group,
and some of them even supported it, participated it, and carried out
its command. They are the minority, alright. But the crime of silence
is real, it kills, and it killed. This is exact the thing that these
protesters are voicing &mdash; that they are **not tolerating** the
violence Isreal is showing. And this, should be the role model for
Gaza! Raise your voice, act, if you indeed don't like Hamas, then, say
it.

And if you don't, then, well.

The students got this all reversed. It's not about the Isreal being
right or wrong. Rather, their exact protest is the lesson they should
be giving to Gaza &mdash; the way of support Gaza, if they sincerely
believe this, is to ask Gaza people to say what they truly feel
&mdash; if they look at Hamas the same way I do, then, silence is not
the right thing to do. Find a piece of lawn. Put up a sign, just like
these students are doing.

But. If these people indeed think the Hamas is a good egg. Well, then
I think this camp on campus, with all its goodwill, is a hypocrisy on
display.
