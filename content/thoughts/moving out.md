Today is the day. Moved out, spending night at new place. No bed, just
a comforter on the floor. But it's ok. Had a fight w/ Noah,
again. Enough. I don't want to be hurt, and hurt him, anymore. It's
better this way.

Sitting here reminds me the days in Shanghai bnb, also a comforter on
a floor, cheap but manageable, and works for the purpose &mdash; being
close to 泰康's shuttle bus stop, so I could visit dad everyday. 

But now, what is the purpose? I'm lost. I miss bunny already. I wish
to hear her meowing now. She would be bored here. I know. It's better
for her to be there, there are just more things for her to chase, to
watch, to get excited, and perhaps, to dream about. So, what is this
life?

It's not a new life to me at all. It's an exile.

The other day on the way back from 517, Noah asked me why I bought
this place. I said the No. 1 reason was that he said he liked this
place, and that, gave it a meaning. Otherwise, all places, any places,
would be the same to me &rarr; they are nothing but a place, like what
I have here right now, quiet, too quiet, pretty looking, but rather,
soulless.

So, it is how it feels to move out. Seven years, finally, this is
happening. I don't feel happy, or sad, or much emotion at all. It
feels, just, lost.
