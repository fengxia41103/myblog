This notion of _技术已经很成熟_ (it is a [mature technology][1]?  a
well known technology? huh? I don't even know how to translate this
line.)  bothers me a LOT! What do you mean by that? There are loads
questions to be clarified, don't you think!?

[1]: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mature_technology

* that the technology has already been developed? 
* that can be easily copied and re-implemented, with the same wonderful results?
* or has been in existence for a while and everybody in the room
understands what it means, and what it takes!? 
* Are we talking about the principle of this technology here? or a
  version of implementation? 
* or some other customized idea based on it? 
* and how do you know it works for you in your application context?
  Have you done a POC? and to what degree your POC was built and
  tested and proven to give you confidence? How far apart is your POC
  from what you envision of the **real** thing? How did you derive
  that conclusioin?

Really, whenever ppl use such a **vain, vague, meaningless**
line as to set the theme of a  discussion, 
it is nothing but a grand title that leads
to nowhere and a unmistakened signal of wasting time on everybody 
involved on the thread, regardless the topic
and actual fact. Truth told, the speaker or the writer just has
zero clue of what the technology really means, how it works,
how it is implemented, what quirks s/he has experienced and is aware
of, how these quirks are going to impact what you are thinking to
achieve with this technology... the list can go on and on and on.

The bottom line is, there isn't such a thing as _mature
technology_. There is known implementation of it; there is successful
case (and failure cases in that matter) of it; there is probably many
many theories and diagrams about it developed from multiple dimensions
of viewing angle so to have an _interpretation_ of it; there is so
called _best practice_ (even this term has been completly **abused**
in context of a technical discussion) of certain aspects of it derived from accrued
experience by others who have treaded on this path before and
attempted a few things here and there while one is easier/harder than
another.

But the way people (bogus tech experts) commonly put this line forward, is really
**implying one huge assumption** that this worked before, and I can
find someone to replicate this result.

Really!? Should we then list some counter example just to make a
point? Computer architecture. Since its birth, its architecture has
always been: a compute unit (CPU), memory (for transitional data),
storage (for data persistence), and data bus (for data
transportation). Every single electronic device that we know of today
follows this exact architecture (in its most general term). Yes it is
a mature design and widely adopted, understood, practiced, and
used. Yet, Intel can do it doesn't mean you can do it. If someone
standing on a stage and starts saying "this is a mature technology,
and I'm going build a computer of XYZ to make it the fastest or the
most powerful of computer on earth", forget it &larr; no, it is a
mature design, probably, but there are million dials to make it work,
and having a architecture diagram at hand shows nothing of its
possible implementation path and its pitfall. If you are the first
time doing it, you will fail, 100% of the time. Like everything else
in life, if you never practiced it before, your odds of striking gold
on the first try is, and should be, **zero**.

So please, don't quote examples of Google whenever you talk about AI
or the best technology company; don't quote Amazon whenever the topic
is about e-commerce or supply chain; don't quote Alibaba or Tencent
whenever it's about Chinese tech ruling the world... because, like a
personal success story, the true capability of the company or the
business contribute to less than 10% of what it achieved. It's the
other 90% that has no theory, no diagram, no roadmap, no recipe, and
impossible to replicate. Period. Besides, duplicating the exact growth
path doesn't guarantee a 1-to-1 copy of their status to you,
either.

Not to mention, technology, is really a particular mindset, a view of
the world and a understanding of the issue, yours against mine. The
difference is not in which tech stack to use. It's in the way we each
build a logic, to do analysis, evaluation, and to battle trench wars
of the old saying of **devils being in the details**,
and to make decisions along the trial-and-error.

If you have done it yourself, speak with detail and concrete,
especially, with fear and concern, with identification of risks
and warning signs. If you don't know yourself but knowing somebody
whom you think can create this thing, let him/her speak. 

Just remember, the phrase _mature technology_ is the first step
in the wrong direction.
