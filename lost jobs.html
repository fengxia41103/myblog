    <h1 class="myhighlight">Lost jobs, not really</h1>
  </div>

  <ol id="toc" class="row"></ol>

    <div id="article-content">
      <p><figure class="col l6 m6 s12">
  <img src="images/robot%20replace%20human.jpg"/>
</figure>

<p>These days, everywhere you turn, there is talk about AI, and one
primary theme is the human fear of being replaced by robots, thus
resulting in huge waves of layoffs and job loss, which then leads to
social turmoils, revolutions, and government collapses. Horrible.</p>
<p>But if you think of it, it isn't new. Not only it isn't new, I think
it is one of those topics that is <strong>perpetual true</strong> and <strong>perpetually
horrible</strong>, whenever you bring it up. Like a nightmare, the only way
to deal with it, is to wake up (in other words, not to think of
it). As long as you put yourself into that scene, man, it's certainly
gonna be bad.</p>
<p>Exaggerated? Just take a step back and name all the parallels you can
think of &mdash; </p>
<ol>
<li>when there is a more efficient way in production &rarr; job loss</li>
<li>when there is a new way in production &rarr; job loss</li>
<li>when an innovation emerges that takes the fantasy of everybody
   &rarr; job loss</li>
</ol>
<p>I think you get the idea. The theme is the same, that the old way of
doing things are bound to be changed, and with that change, many
positions will be eliminated, and people lose their old jobs because
<strong>they are not needed anymore</strong>.</p>
<p>So in the core, the fear is about not feeling needed anymore, an
abandonment if you will, by the society. Isn't this the same as being
abandoned by love? I have always been thinking that if only one knows
where the next relationship is, the agony of breaking up wouldn't be
that hard at all. Borrowing from the Hunger Game, <em>the only thing that
is more powerful than fear, is hope</em>.</p>
<p>I recall the book of <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Affluent-Society-John-Kenneth-Galbraith/dp/0395925002">The Affluent Society</a>, which argues that with
the prosperity of America, many will be rendered <strong>idle</strong> because high
production efficiency simply doesn't need that many labor. The author
said this new class, the <strong>ideal class</strong>, is not only natural, but
actually good, so might as well embrace it instead of fighting it.</p>
<p>Doesn't it sound the same arguments we are hearing about AI? Yes, I
think so. That's why I say this topic isn't new, and is going to be
repeated over and over and over. Different trigger, same talk.</p>
<h1>Your job, isn't ready</h1>
<p>Then I was thinking, what type of jobs will be eliminated? The
immediate reaction will be &mdash; low skill jobs. They can be easily
replaced by machine power, can't they? </p>
<blockquote>
<p>But, what if, your job, isn't ready!?</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Robots/computers aren't monsters who just eat everything on its way
and still digest well. They pick; they have an appetite of certain
things, but not all.  So the question becomes, what do they like?
They like logic, reasoning, and deterministic result; their stomach
doesn't do well if you feed them <strong>ambiguity</strong>. What are these about?
Not sheer machine power, your arms vs. his hydraulics. It's about
<strong>decision making</strong> (in today's glorified term, it's about <strong>intelligence</strong>).</p>
<p>In any computerized application, there is an
inherent decision making process, which is derived from offline domain
knowledge. Computer is really brainless, actually. Unless you tell it
there is a decision to be made, and these are the <code>if-else</code> you need
to make your decisions based on, it has no idea. So who knows there is
a decision point, and here are the 4-5 options, and condition to pick
one over another? &mdash; someone who possessed this domain
knowledge, be it from experience, from business requirement, from
management needs, from a genius stroke &mdash; they are all
<strong>offline</strong> and <strong>domain specific</strong>. <span class="myhighlight">
Computer can model, implement,
and enforce them; but it can't invent them</span>.</p>
<p>So what type of jobs are ready to be, <strong>computerized</strong>? Corporate
jobs, because they are usually better defined (what to do), better
structured (how to do it), better documented (models), better
understood (explicit domain knowledge), and often repetitive (wow, 
this is paradise for computers). To replace a guy shoveling a
sidewalk, his labor can be easily done by a robot, but his pattern of
shoveling and his experience of digging here versus there because of
the difference of soil or his tool, if there is any, well, 
nobody has ever spend time
to extract that <strong>domain knowledge</strong>, therefore computer is
<strong>clueless</strong> about him, therefore, his job is just not READY!</p>
<p>The fundamental law here is the cliche that <strong>there is no free
lunch</strong>. Extracting that domain knowledge and modeling it into a
computer bears a cost (cost of someone else to understand you, and you
willing to open up your <em>secrets</em>), and that cost does not justify
someone to study and figure out how a robot can do that shoveling
job. Human labor, as long as it is cheaper than this cost, is plainly
safe, for economic reason.</p>
<p>So, as long as your job sucks to a degree that it is boring, making
only reasonable profits, and disgusts many people, your job is safe.
Of course, here lies the other extreme of the spectrum, that the job
is challenging to the point that human simply doesn't know how to
model it or even understand it, say, <code>write me an awesome novel</code>,
<code>play the piano like Mozart did</code> &mdash; unless you can define
<code>awesomeness</code> and can model <code>Mozart</code> style, you are out of luck.</p></p>
