很多人都i知道，浪漫的爱情里，两个人都怕时间太短，都说要长相守，两不忘。
最浪漫的话，是陪你慢慢变老。 Then this morning I had another
thought. 

All families have some burdens that trouble them, regardless how
wealthy they are, how wonderful they look to outsiders, how much love
they have for each other. There just
isn't one single, perfectly happy, worry-free, trouble-free,
conflict-free family. But then, with dad's current condition, he
doesn't understand these troubles anymore. What used to be a
forbidden topic can now be safely said in front of him &mdash;
grantedly he has his own world these days and that world isn't worry
free either. However, he is not bothered by the worries that is
troubling me.

So I was thinking, the most romantic thing is not to accompany you
till age, but <span class="myhighlight">to be with you till you don't
remember the past anymore.</span> 是的，就是这样的，不用慢慢的变老，是
陪伴着到有一天，那个人已经忘记，不再想起，想起了，你也认得出是回忆，但
不是从前的故事了，是另一段回忆里生长出来的世界，那个世界里，依然有
两个人，也是一半的幸福，一半的忧伤，那就真是陪着了，不变老，也不忘记。
