- Expanse: Ann Zhang will reimburse all costs

## food

**Mix dry food w/ a bit olive oil in the morning**

- Glass jars in the middle drawer next to the frig.
- New in bags in the trash can glider on the left side of the
  dishwasher.
- Amount: in general cover the bottom of the small salad bowl.
- Main meals: breakfast (7-8am) and dinner (5:30-6pm). Go with your
  own meal schedule would be fine. He will be begging for food as soon
  as you are eating.
- Light meals & snacks: lunch, after each potty run, and before
  bed (sometimes I just gave him some milk).
- He doesn't have regular web food. Once a while I give him cat food
  from Noah's place. That's his special treat.
- I usually give him my plate after I'm done, nothing on it but small
  pieces at most. I feel it's more of a ceremony to him that he is not
  left out of the whole deal. Otherwise, he seems not psychologically
  satisfied.
- He doesn't drink much. A salad bowl w/ fresh water. He likes water
  cold.
- He has no teeth left. So he can't chew.
- He loves bones. But only give him large ones so that he can't
  swallow to choke himself.

## potty

### schedule

Every 4-6 hours, ideally.

| 7:30am | 12pm | 5pm | 10pm |

Adjust according to your routine. If leaving him home alone, I usually
will shift his runs so that I could give him one just before leaving.

He usually poops once a day, most likely in the first run or the last
run. **Always** bring the bags. He does it twice in most cases, so you
need two bags at least. After the first one, he may walk a little bit
before he squats again for his 2nd shot. So be careful where you take
him. I had once he did it when we were crossing zebra line, hahaha,
awkward.

### places

He is used to doing it on the sidewalk. So I try to move him at least
away from shop front or crowds. But sometimes he did it right in the
middle of the road (and stopped all traffic!! Imagine!!).

The bushes by the church on Merrit Road (turn left towards Franklins
if taking the west exit) is usually a good bet. The ones before the
municipal parking lot right across street from our building front is
another spot he will hang out and often does it. Other places vary.

Bike racks on the west side of the building.

If walking along Franklins, just about any trash can or parking lot
pole or tree roots get his attention. I haven't yet figured it out
what's so special about them.

### signs

- If in the morning, he would walk briskly once out of the elevator
  towards the side entrance. In this case he would usually do it right
  after getting outside. Sometimes I could move him across the street,
  but that depends.

- If he talks eagerly after seeing you coming home, he likely needs a
  pee. Sometimes it's a false alarm, but I have been giving him a walk
  nonetheless since it calms him down, also. Most of the times he is
  quiet, even when having accident.

- Watch out his water intake. He usually consumes a salad bowl of
  water per day. If he drinks heavily one day, be ready to have more
  frequent runs.

- If he starts agitates instead of lying quietly in one place, he
  needs a run. It's very much like a little kid.

- If he gets up in the middle of the night, chances are he is going to
  have an accident.

### accidents

It's usually when I left him home for 5-6 hours due to my
routine. Places vary. No patterns have been identified. Sometimes I
wonder he was just not happy about the situation. Because of his size
damage is manageable. I put hims bowls now on the rug so that he
doesn't use that area for accidents anymore.

He never did it in bedroom, nor near food including frig. Furniture
wise the only case was by a chair's foot but never happened there
again. Overall these are rare events.

## allergy/skin

His dry skin is a concern. I have no recommendation. Giving him a warm
bath helps to remove most of them. But they reappear.

There are, sometimes, red spots around his peanut and he licks more
than usual of that area. There is a prescription pad one can use to
wipe the area. It helps.

I have some of his allergy pills, too. I have also tried human allergy
pills (half our dose every 24 hr) on him. No visible effect.

## beauty

Warm towel to clean his face, especially around his eye area.

Warm bath using shower spray and his shampoo monthly would be good
enough. Shampoo needs to be on him for 15 min.  He doesn't like head
wet, but he cooperates well.

I also give his feet and belly a rinse before bed.

## workout

He doesn't walk far. He could, however, walk to the Bolin Creek Trail,
just at his pace. The trail we went the most often is the
bike/pedistrian trail by the railway track behind the carwash place.

He gets hot in the sun due to his hair color. You could tell he slows
down and starts looking for shades.

In most cases, a slow walk around the building is sufficient for him.

## odd ends

- He doesn't like rain or wet ground. When rain he would walk close to
  the building where grounds are dry. You can make him go into the
  rain to do his business, however. Sometimes I would carry him to his
  place. If caught in a rain he manages fine, however. Sometimes he
  would walk as usual right after a rain. So it depends on his mood of
  the day I guess.

- He sings to a high pitch piano sound. So when watching TV or playing
  music, don't be surprised if he suddenly joins.

- One of his digits grows upwards. It may cause him some trouble
  walking, I suspect.

- There could be small pebble or odds stuck in his paw hairs. So
  please use the finger to feel them and remove if any. It must be
  uncomfortable.

## Don'ts

- **Walk around any caktus!!** His nose got pierced once, and his paw
  was pierced by a fallen spike once, too. Poor thing. Both times I
  was able to pull the needle out, but they were close calls. Nowadays
  I either pull him far away from them, or carry him passing the
  bushes so to eliminate possibilities. Mostly I worry the wound will
  be infected.
