<p>It feels like vacation, this working remote from home, that's how it
feels, to me. Not only the work is not fully loaded relative to my
capacity, but the rhythm of life, especially when Noah is at mom's
place, just myself, sitting here, watching out the window to the
horizon, to the street, to the sunrise, the sunset... everything of
these moments, remind me the moment of trips I had taken, the one in
Japan, the one in Cambodia, the one is Huili, the one in
Kunming... just like this, sitting by the window, after a night's
sometimes sound sleep, sometimes an uneasy one, watching a place,
feeling familiar but at the same time strange.</p>
<p>There is this little barber shop across the street. The barber, Ken,
said he opens at 7 o'clock in the morning on Saturday. Here it is, the
lights are on. When all the surroundings are still gray from waking
up, the lights shine through his shop window rather feels brighter
than it actually is, but standing out for sure. I have never seen any
customer at that hour of the day. Then why? He looks like a decent
man. So is he running away from his family by lying about his shop
hours? But why, then? I will ask him next time.</p>
<p>On the side of his two-story building, there is now a giant mural,
almost black and white (mostly shades of grays, no colors), of a
person with a guitar. Noah and I actually bumped into the guy who was
doing the painting on the first day, I should say, on his first
night. We were coming back from Cary, turning around the corner of
this street, wow, here it is, this giant <em>mural</em> on this wall!!! It
was 9, maybe 10, at night, and the weather was quite clear and
pleasant. I got curious whether he did it with paints, or is a printed
wall decal. So we went over after parking the car. Then it turned out,
what I was looking at was a <strong>giant image projected</strong> on this wall!!!
About 30 feet away from the wall, there is this projector. So the guy
projected it so he could use spray paints to mark out the
outlines. Then, the next couple days, he came back during day and
worked on it, and many many many people stopped by, taking
pictures. There were these three girls, who drove their car here, and
each then pulled out some camera gears, and took photos of this
wall!... and here I am, sitting on the my bed, just waking up from a
Fall's Saturday, and here it is, right next by me, on this wall, as if
the artist just painted for me. If there were truly God, I now have to
say, I feel I'm being spoiled by him. Thank you.</p>
<p>Election is near. Terrible atmosphere. When Trump was first elected, I
thought he was an unconventional politician and may do unconventional
things instead of the status quo, you know, play the political
game. But now, I give him credit for his smartness, he is sharp and
not stupid at all, but he is not a nice person, and that says it
all. The country is split, all the news of violence here and there,
the topic of Trump is becoming a synonym of Chinese medicine, a taboo,
if you still want to have a pleasant and meaningful conversation. One
thing I like the most of America is the friendliness of strangers,
that you can bump into anyone on the street, give him/her a smile, and
you get one back, and you feel safe and comfortable approach anyone
for a chitchat. Not anymore. You start to see them wearing a <em>party
sign</em>, like a halo, and you ask yourself which side s/he is on, and
that deters the thought to approach them. What is this? It's fear,
indeed, and that's what Trump's four year brought, fear.</p>
<p>I wonder whether the book I read reflects my mental state at the time?
Like music, the same piece can hit you so hard on one day that makes
you cry and cry and cry, then, you listen to it again, and I can't
find that emotion anymore! So for the books. Picked up the sequel to
the <a href="https://fengxia41103.github.io/myblog/humans in new york.html">Humans to New York</a>, more portraits, more stories, but I
didn't have the sensation anymore. One or two still touched me, but
the most of them felt, mediocre. The author lost the casualness of
those shots in the first album. Also, I feel the first album had a
<em>passion</em> in it, that he had so many shots of a person's hair, such a
sophisticated piece, a person's hand wearing all sorts of rings and
stones, or a pair of socks, or a tatoo... all these, felt, more, life,
more real, more, interesting, because, all these, are a part of a
person, that s/he deliberately made, put it on, and thus, mean
something to her. Face may be the standard representation of a person,
but all these little things are even more revealing, of who they are.</p>
<p>Sun is rising. The light is now casted half way over the hotel
building I could see directly from my window. On this side of the
street, still shadows, and the barber shop's light, is on, and no
customer, no cars driving by, hardly even pedestrians considering the
large population of young college kids in the neighbourhood. A quiet
Saturday morning, chilly outside. It's Fall, and watching the leaves
on the ground and some of them just falling from tree and were still
dangling and dancing in the air on its way down, what a name,
<strong>Fall</strong>, indeed, it is Fall, as everything is, falling down.</p>
<p>A line from the book, page 147, a woman across a desk:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"I'm eight-six. And that's about enough. I'm ready to go."</p>
<p>"Aren't you afraid of death?"</p>
<p>"Why would I be?"</p>
<p>"Isn't that sort of a natural condition of living?"</p>
<p>"Not when you miss your husband as much as I do."
</p>
</blockquote></p>
