I guess it must be hard. Noah completely tipped me off again
today. His glasses were bent (slightly), and I asked him what
happened. He said there was nothing. Then he said yes he was hit by
somebody. Then the story turned out to be that he chose to be under
someone's chair during _independent reading_ time, and the kid kicked
into his face, somehow. 

I was totally mad! on multiple degrees!

First, lie. I hate this. If you  did it, admit it. Don't try to wiggle
out of it,  especially when you are  only, what, 10!? There  is no way
you are going to fool me yet. And, didn't we just talk about this last
week, that  any lie will  only lead  to more lies  so it rolls  like a
snowball until a spectacular fall. The longer you can cover it up, the
messier it will be  when it crashes. I know kid  doesn't this yet. But
this is a lesson in life, and he needs to learn it, needs to memorizes
this, needs to **never do this again**.

Second, integrity. We just went over  last week! I was pissed off when
finding out during a school's parent even that he had skipped A LOT of
works in  class (I'm talking  4 out of 5  pages are just  blank!!!) He
said  they are  optional.  Fine.  But even  the  required  one is  not
completed! We had  a long discussion after it, and  it wasn't pleasant
at all. I brought up the  topic of `integrity`, which his social study
went over in 3rd grade. Integrity, is  to do the right thing even when
no one  is looking or knowing.  I was using  it to tell him  that even
without me  finding out, he should  have been a good  student in these
classes  by doing  his homework  and  listening to  teachers. But,  he
didn't, and this is really upsetting.

Even just a couple weeks ago, we were joking about his 1st grade day
when the Japanese teacher emailed us about his **unacceptable
behavior** in her class. He said, "I remembered!" I was actually
rather surprised, and impressed. But then!? This!? This is really
disappointing.

Third, poor judgment. I really hate to say this, but putting your own
face to someone's foot as a fun way to play, in class!!?, is just
plain stupid. He was asking for it, asking for the damage, asking to
be kicked. He didn't care a thing about what could have happened to
his glasses, to his safety.. this is just, fxxxx, stupid! I wish the
kid could have kicked a lot harder than just causing a bent glasses,
if only he could then learn the lesson. 

I don't know. Sometimes I really feel he has a terrible judgement. I
try to argue that it is his age, and his even less age than his
calendar age psychologically. Yet, I really think this will carry into
his life even when he is older. Poor judgment don't just go away. I
have witnesses many in adults, and it just amazes me how and why these
people could not comprehend &mdash; people racing to a red light,
saying one thing while acting another, pretending what they are not,
feeling blown up as if they were god, looking down people who serve
them, believing a superficial statement w/o questioning or even
thinking.....

I don't know. By being different, Noah is actually becoming the very
opposite of his wishes &rarr; he is becoming commonly mindless,
stupid, mass.
