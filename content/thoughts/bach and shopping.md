2020 Thanksgiving day. Sitting here and listening to [Hilary Hahn][1]
playing Bach at the end of the concerto, what a wonderful sound! When
I was at Noah's age, Dad used to listen to Bach and Hendel, and I
thought they were no comparison to the pop songs I liked, and they
were not only not beautiful, but rather ugly, close to being a
noise... how time has changed! and how much I have changed! Maybe it's
the age, that is teaching me now to appreciate this music, and the
mind too fragile to handle the stimulation of youth, the bang bang
bang, but seeking now peace, calm, and indeed, beauty.

The big shopping day of the year. I had crave for a few things, but
then, while tuning up the volume w/ the remote and letting Bach to
fill in the room, I can't help thanking myself that I made this
purchase, and it works so nicely, and making this moment all the more
enjoyable than ever. That, however, also got me thinking, back in the
days, when people were not living with luxury (well, there were always
some who had more than necessities), they only had, and probably cared
about, things that were practical in use. If the thing happened to be
also artful, bonus. Didn't all the antiques, like those super
expansive bowls or tea cups or plates, were all useful things!?
Instead of just being a play thing on the shelf, which seems to be the
identity of art or artifact, they were actually active participant of
daily living activities. They may look delicate, but they were
supposed to be durable and can sustain rough hands.

This same idea has been echoed in this book, [Peaks and Lamas][2],
that Tibetan, though lived a poverty life if judged by industrial
standard, but their life had beautiful things that were not diminished
by their minimal living style at all. It's really a mindset, that they
spent that much money on things that an industrial person would not
care, yet, we industrial people crave for those arts they have but
using for daily routine tasks. How ironic!

So while holding the remote, I start to think that the craves I had
these couple days, especially on this shopping day, is but another
testimony of this irony. I should really remind myself not to purchase
just because they are on discount. It would be much more pleasing to
fill the room with beautiful, and useful, things, than a pile of,
things that are good deals but idling. This makes me wonder, aren't we
now in the **Age of Junk**, that many many affluent people buy things
without giving enough debate whether they are practical or necessary
(of course, they always convince themselves of the purchase that they
were practical and necessary). Instead, they just give in to the
desire, but in nearly all cases, ended up living with a thing they
don't love anymore, and look ugly. It's the sense of chasing novelty
winning the race, while the sense of beauty was left behind. Sad.
