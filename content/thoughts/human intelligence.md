What in incredible [paper][1]! This says so much computer and
artificial intelligence than any of the popular talks.

I have had a few conversations w/ people who are not computer workers,
for example, the girl who is taking care of my Dad. I have always
found it difficult to demonstrate the value of computer, and at the
same time annoyed by elites who brag about the **future without
understanding or even giving much thoughts to the complexity of their
empty promise, and the implication, especially social ones, that a new
way of doing things can bring**. I will refine this further that there
are too much attention given to the positive side of a change, which
is exciting, both financially and socially, and too little to view it
from a structure that, for example, presented in this paper, that
guides to understand in which area/domain this change belongs to, how
and why it can an impact, who is a first-degree neighbour thus be
affected, and in what way.

Structure, framework. I have always been advocating that in order to
approach an issue, however complex (or simplistic) it is, to have a
framework in place (and it can be completely subjective and incorrect)
is better than none. Framework is essentially of personal view of the
issue. It is not an arbitrary mark you throw on the wall and call it a
structure. Rather, it is a fruit of deep thinking based on that
person's experience, intelligence, and view of the world even. It is
actually a summary of the all the information presented at the time
and were understood by this person, and is thus an aggregation of
information in shape of a design. If you think about it, everyone is
an architect &mdash; we all operate this way (just like this paper is
presenting), that we use our sensory system to collect information,
which by nature will only be a subset of ALL, and then even a smaller
portion of these collected info will be comprehensive to us, and
translated into a place in an overall hiearchy, which formulates a
reason that explains the info &larr; this is the info process, and
potentially triggers a motivation that leads to action.

Therefore, it is only natural that one has a framework, even
implicitly, because one must have one to operate. Yet, the ability to
recognize your own framework, and be able or willing to present it, is
the difference. This probably can be argued as how much one
understands oneself. Self-reflection brings not only a peace of mind, but a
depressing view of oneself &mdash; how limited one is! how
un-intelligent one is! But intelligence don't change unless one sees
where it is (otherwise, one doesn't even have a reference to compare
to, thus will know no improvement nor degradation). Thus, to define
and present one's view, is a bold move, which shows in affirmative
statements. But this is different from those emotion driven
entrepreneurs, who lack the ability to think, but have too much
ability to fool.
