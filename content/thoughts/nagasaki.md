What a fine early Autumn day, nice weather, nice temperature, nice
breeze. Noah's first day to the middle school. His bus left at 7:36,
so the day all started early, which feels, great, that I have done the
gym and have checked my emails, and now can write down some thoughts
before noon. Like it, except for the mosquito who just bited me, but
unfortunately it landed on the seat next to mine, and SQUASH, it's
now, dead &larr; does monk kill mosquitoes? I mean, do they consider
them a form of life also, so that by their religious code that they
shouldn't harm them either? or, they classify mosquitoes as a
different kind, like 妖魔鬼怪 in 西游记, that can be killed at will?

Talking about 西游记， this is what brought me to write this article
&larr; Noah and I were riding back from Reader's Corner (btw, I picked
up a book, Russel's [why I am not a Christian], flipped through a few
pages while waiting for our take out yesterday, very interesting!), I
think we were discussing what to eat, and he said he was not hungry.

> "你这是要成仙啊!" I commented.

> "What is 仙？" He asked

> "They don't need food, they can just live, like 孙悟空。" I tried to
> relate this concept to something he knows.

Then all of sudden, it got me thinking &mdash; 孙悟空 is a rock, then
why does he still eat, say 蟠桃!? and even more importantly, where do
these food go!!!!? I mean, does he have a digestion system? and what
about the, waste!!? Toilet won't help, right!? does he even have those
parts, and the hole? Never thought of this. We know he had a feast on
蟠桃大会， but it was never discussed whether he processed these foods
in the same/similar way as we do (which I believe majority of the
audiences all think so!), and whether there are anything left at the
end of this process, and how he got them _out of his body_!?

Fascinating, isn't it!? I have argued in [another article][2] about
how devils are truly in details, that the romance of the three kingdom
never explained/described how their massive armies were arranging to
handle human waste. Then here it is again, the all powerful monkey
king was always eager for those magical goodies, 蟠桃，仙丹，人参果,
but never had the need to either pee or poop! &rarr; I guess you can
argue that he is super human, thus handle these _foods_ differently,
or that these foods converts 100% into energy of some sort, thus will
not generate waste... but then, the 2nd one is shaky, because in the
novel this guy ate all sort of things, especially when he was still
only a mafia boss in his own territory &rarr; so he was eating all
kinds of **ordinary** food. And even, let's say, he has upgraded his
status to have now access to these magical foods, it's up him to judge
whether this food is 100% energy, or only 80% &mdash; I'm now thinking
how 猪猪 smells my food sometimes and will not even touch it, and I
was always wondering how he knew this meat/milk is fine, but the other
isn't. So I suspect the same challenge is faced by Mr.孙， how does he
know!?

Well, I know novels are fictional, and just any novel has ignored this
part of human life completely, thus it's just a convention I
guess. But a lot of time when I was reading novels, I found the author
trying very hard to describe **details** with an intention to bring
viewers into the scene as if it were soooooo real! Yet they all choose
not to address this one single super important part of living &mdash;
there are plenty description of feast, of hunger, of struggle for
food, of survival on scraps, but characters, especially the super
heroes, simply do not go to bathroom!

But then, reading the book [Nagasaki][3], the reality flies right into
your face &mdash; messy, ugly, painful, full of choices that ended w/
terrible outcome, decisions that were bad or even fatal, good
intentions went nowhere, begging for help received no response... I,
like many many others, have been left with impression that the two
nuclear bombs every dropped on real human &mdash; Nagasaki and
Hiroshima, ended the war and saved lives (usually we deem them to be
American lives). Then we feel relieved and literally, moved on &mdash;
moved on with our thoughts, with our discussions, with our
interests. **I have never given it much thought to realize that even
when the war was over, the life did not.** For all the survivors of
the war, of course the survivors of Nagasaki, the war was over six
days later, but life didn't. When we were all cheering to draw a
period on history and ready to flip the page, the misery of these
people have just started.

Reading a book like this is, real, because when the details are being
considered, described, you see the struggle of everyday life. The same
sentiments are played when you lose someone dear, like Lei to me, that
the deceased didn't really just disappear, they left a lot for the
livings to absorb, sometimes good, heart warming, sometimes, sad,
difficult to swallow. The life is truly like a never ending stream
&mdash; it goes on and on and on with or without you, or the one you
loved. But then, a moment like such trauma came, making a splash, or
changing the course completely, often in an instance, but you
have to endure its consequence for a long long long long time. 

Indeed, it's easy to mark an end of, an era, a war, but how to mark
the end of, a life? Death? That's not enough, either. This makes me
now think of the cartoon [Coco][4] &mdash; a life ends when, no one
remembers you anymore... and if I still remember, still has the
memory, can I give more life, to you!? I wish it will.
