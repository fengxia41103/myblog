&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I noticed that there is always some &lt;strong&gt;after market&lt;/strong&gt; news or earning&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;calls that will sway the market. Further, apparently trading is going
on after the market is closed to me! Therefore, there is a dark period
when the price is moving, but I can not participate until the next
morning. Using this value together with daily return, I'm hoping to
gain sense how likely an up seen overnight will translate to an up
during day.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;My indicators&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is really what got me to begin with &amp;mdash; the analysis edge I
was hoping to achieve. I think this is the same drive that you have in
mind. If so, read on.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;figure class="col s12"&gt;
  &lt;img src="images/stock/my%20indicators.png"/&gt;
  &lt;figcaption&gt;Example of my indicators&lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;code&gt;end-to-end return %&lt;/code&gt;: if I buy at the first &lt;code&gt;open&lt;/code&gt; price, and hold
  it till the last &lt;code&gt;close&lt;/code&gt; price, how much do you gain? I also call
  this &lt;code&gt;range return&lt;/code&gt;. One can easily picture that any buy-sell pair
  can be viewed as a range return. Of course, in reality, buying at
  open price and sell at close price is not possible, at least not for
  me. So whatever the return is, it's an ideal situation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;code&gt;compounded return %&lt;/code&gt;: this is to emulate a busy day trader who,
  instead of holding through the range, buy at each &lt;code&gt;open&lt;/code&gt; and sell at
  each &lt;code&gt;close&lt;/code&gt;, thus riding the daily wave. Since there are ups and
  downs, what is the compounded return then?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In most cases I looked at, compounded return is always &amp;lt; range
  return. Therefore, riding wave is not a good idea, even when
  transaction fee is 0.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;code&gt;close price RSD %&lt;/code&gt;: RSD, relative standard deviation, is to measure
  how much swing close price is seen in this time period. The larger
  the value, the more volatile it appeared.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One catch, however, is that when computed over a longer time period,
  because prices is ever going up, for example, this value will
  naturally become larger. Therefore, it's more useful if you compare
  stock A vs. B over the same period, not to a single stock itself.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;code&gt;overnight flip/consistency&lt;/code&gt;: I'm curious how likely an overnight
  trend carries over to the next day&lt;sup id="fnref:1"&gt;&lt;a class="footnote-ref" href="#fn:1"&gt;1&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;. Numbers are day count.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;code&gt;overnight flip returns up %/down %&lt;/code&gt;: This is one step further on
  observing an overnight trend against its next day. In a flip, there
  could be a large up, then a small down, and vice versa. Therefore,
  by computing the compounded return of overnight and today, we can
  see how many flips resulted in a positive return. Up and down % adds
  up to 100%.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the example above, among overnight flips, 46% would have resulted
  in a positive return, but 56% in the negative. Therefore, in this
  case down flips were not compensated enough by the next day ups,
  meaning the sentiment, though flipped a bit, was still carrying the
  day.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;code&gt;two-day trend up/down/flip&lt;/code&gt;: Taking two consecutive days, how many
  are both ups, downs, or reversed. Since human is naturally looking
  at yesterday's trend feeling it will be duplicated today&lt;sup id="fnref:2"&gt;&lt;a class="footnote-ref" href="#fn:2"&gt;2&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;,
  knowing how likely today's positive will flip is at least a useful
  probability measure.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;code&gt;daily return up %/down %&lt;/code&gt;: Easy. Take each day's return, what's the
  odds you would have made money if riding that day? In the example
  above, 50/50, indeed a random walk down the Wall Street.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;code&gt;nightly return up %/down %&lt;/code&gt;: Counting overnight returns, how likely
  it would have gone up or down. Using this probability, one may bet
  the overnight. One reason is that overnight is off limit to
  investor. We simply don't have access or control over this period,
  but the market doesn't sleep. Further, I noticed that some companies
  make earning calls deliberately after market is closed. Therefore,
  this is really a period of uncertainty by design of the system.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;code&gt;up daily return avg/RSD %&lt;/code&gt;: Curious how much a daily up we saw in
  term of average and its RSD. Taking this together w/ &lt;code&gt;down daily
  return avg/RSD %&lt;/code&gt;, I'm hoping to shed light whether upside is better
  than the downside.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the example, upside avg was 1.91% while downside was
  2.11%. Therefore, downside dominated, in average. Up's RSD was less
  than down's, so that we saw larger scale of swing when there was a
  down day than one of an up day. So overall, I would take this period
  as a down period and would expect to lose since the odds were not in
  up's favor.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;Tech indicators&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I didn't invent any of these. Found this &lt;a href="https://github.com/rrag/react-stockcharts"&gt;react library&lt;/a&gt;, and am
using it to plot these fancies. One downside of this approach is that
I don't have computed numbers such as SMAs. So later I might
re-implement these values so to make more sense of them.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One observation is that all of them are doing some kind of SMA, which
is essentially a smoothing technique. I have commented in &lt;a href="{filename}/workspace/stock/stock%20detail.md"&gt;previous
article&lt;/a&gt; that this is a double edge sword as it can generate so
called a pattern for pattern's sake.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Further, these charts are clearly against philosophy that stock
history is not a reliable indicator of the &lt;em&gt;future&lt;/em&gt;. Therefore, I have
them here because of their popularity mostly.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;li id="fn:1"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In theory, you can profit off any probability that is greater
than 50. Therefore, if there is a discrepancy between consistency
and flip, you should be able to bet the next day using this
probability. This same thought goes to other &lt;em&gt;flip/consistency&lt;/em&gt;
measures.&amp;#160;&lt;a class="footnote-backref" href="#fnref:1" title="Jump back to footnote 1 in the text"&gt;&amp;#8617;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Even though it is a cliche that history does not predict the
future, in stock's case, it is difficult for layman investor such
as myself to think otherwise. Yesterday's trend is the closest
information we have got.&amp;#160;&lt;a class="footnote-backref" href="#fnref:2" title="Jump back to footnote 2 in the text"&gt;&amp;#8617;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;code&gt;ROE Gap %&lt;/code&gt;: Since there is also &lt;em&gt;published&lt;/em&gt; ROE, this value
  indicates how far off the Dupont ROE from published one: &lt;code&gt;% =
  (published-dupont)/published&lt;/code&gt;&lt;sup id="fnref:1"&gt;&lt;a class="footnote-ref" href="#fn:1"&gt;1&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;. Negative value will indicate that
  consensus opinion is more &lt;em&gt;conservative&lt;/em&gt; on this stock than I am.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;code&gt;Top 10 Institution Owned %&lt;/code&gt;: Counting the ownership of top 10
  largest institutional owner/investor in this stock.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;Dupont ROE&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.investopedia.com/terms/d/dupontanalysis.asp"&gt;Dupont model&lt;/a&gt; is a &lt;strong&gt;decomposition&lt;/strong&gt; of ROE.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There are three major financial metrics that drive return on equity
(ROE): operating efficiency, asset use efficiency and financial
leverage. Operating efficiency is represented by net profit margin
or net income divided by total sales or revenue. Asset use
efficiency is measured by the asset turnover ratio. Leverage is
measured by the equity multiplier, which is equal to average assets
divided by average equity.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What I like about this is the distinction of three different business models:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;high margin&lt;/strong&gt;: reflected in high profit margin. Their unit profit
   is good, think of high-end fashion. Downside of this type is that
   increasing volume will work against high unit margin. Thus scaling
   up by producing more is not the right strategy.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;high turn over&lt;/strong&gt;: think of Walmart, low unit margin, but huge
   volume. This is the opposite of high margin model, and is the
   dominant strategy by nearly all new entrants of an industry &amp;larr;
   selling things cheap is always a eyeball catcher.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;high leverage&lt;/strong&gt;: don't know yet how to read this value because it
   feels a double-edge sword &amp;mdash; can be interpreted as having the
   good credit to borrow (assuming banks are not stupid), or, on the
   other hand, loaded w/ debt and is in trouble. Further, this is
   highly dependent on the macro when debt is cheap or expansive, and
   I would even say the personality of CFO, as we all know, gamblers
   stack high leverage, and conservative grandpa hates debt. A common
   example of this model is the financial industry, whose foundation
   is leverage.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;ROE, or the published ROE you find online, is usually based on an
averaged sales over multiple reporting periods, averaged assets, and
so on, thus resulting a single number.  This tool, however, computes
ROE for each reporting period, thus shedding lights on how ROE has
changed over time&lt;sup id="fnref:2"&gt;&lt;a class="footnote-ref" href="#fn:2"&gt;2&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;figure class="col s12"&gt;

  &lt;img src="images/stock/dupont%20roe%20values.png"/&gt;
  &lt;figcaption&gt;Example of Dupont Period-to-Period&lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Chart is normalized so to see its change easily. In this example
above, MSFT's ROE runs around 30 year to year. Profit margin and asset
turnover all went up in 2020 report, indicating a healthy business
operation. Its equity multiplier dropped a bit, indicating it is
taking on more debt than before. Considering MSFT's reputation, I
wouldn't then worry about its increased debt, and further considering
the cheap interest rate, it's likely a good strategy to leverage up in
this period. For example, if you google &lt;code&gt;msft bond rate&lt;/code&gt;, MSFT is
running at &lt;a href="https://cbonds.com/bonds/87917/#:~:text=International%20bonds%3A%20Microsoft%2C%203.625%25%2015dec2023%2C%20USD%20(US594918AW47)"&gt;&lt;code&gt;3.625%&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, making borrowing money quite cheap for MSFT.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;Net Asset per Share&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.investopedia.com/terms/a/asset-based-approach.asp"&gt;Net asset&lt;/a&gt; valuation is often applied to company that will be
liquidated. Here I'm applying a simple version: &lt;code&gt;(total asset - total
liabilities)/shares&lt;/code&gt;. The idea is that if I pay off all liabilities,
what's left for stockholder, assuming you get asset for its book
value. Of course, this is a very rough estimation.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;However, there is also an important underline assumption that &lt;strong&gt;asset
will grow together with business&lt;/strong&gt; &amp;larr; essentially the company is
becoming bigger and bigger, and that biggness is in term of its
assets. Therefore, if it is deemed a healthy business, growing net
assets per share should be an indicator of its success. Using the
example above, BFAM's NAV grew from $12 to $21. Considering it is
acquiring more daycare centers and probably equipment with them, I am
taking this trend as a healthy growth of the business.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;DCF&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yeah I did quite some DCFs back in the MBA days, and sadly, I almost
forgot how to do it. So here it is, bringing back some memories.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;figure class="col s12"&gt;
  &lt;img src="images/stock/dcf.png"/&gt;
  &lt;figcaption&gt;Example of DCF&lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;DCF has a &lt;strong&gt;lot of assumptions&lt;/strong&gt;. So I really don't see how to verify
or beat the market on all these dials single-handedly. Play with your
scenario by tweaking the input fields see how it will affect the
valuation&lt;sup id="fnref:3"&gt;&lt;a class="footnote-ref" href="#fn:3"&gt;3&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;. &lt;strong&gt;Note&lt;/strong&gt; that terminal rate has a dramatic impact on the
valuation. So be prudent in your projection. Also, if your target is
an ETF, there won't be a DCF because it doesn't have balance sheet.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;Balance Sheet&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Balance sheet data are the largest data set. See &lt;a href="https://yahooquery.dpguthrie.com/guide/ticker/financials/#balance_sheet"&gt;yahooquery doc&lt;/a&gt;
for available data points. I found raw numbers on a balance sheet are
rather pointless because human brain isn't good at processing
them. Further, knowing one's asset is 2.3B is meaningless, but its
changing from 2.3B to 2300B in one period is revealing! Therefore, for
balance sheet analysis, I'm not listing any reported numbers, but are
focusing on % of a total, and the same index change % from one period
to next.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;figure class="col s12"&gt;
  &lt;img src="images/stock/balance%20sheet.png"/&gt;
  &lt;figcaption&gt;Example of balance sheet&lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I want to be conservative. Therefore, more attention is given to debt
and liability.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;code&gt;equity multiplier&lt;/code&gt;: &lt;code&gt;= asset / equity&lt;/code&gt;. Since &lt;code&gt;asset=debt+equity&lt;/code&gt;,
  the higher this multiplier is, the more debt this company is taking,
  thus more leveraged. This, of course, is a double edged sword. It
  can mean that it has capability to raise debt (w/ lenders), thus
  using less equity to do business; it an also mean it's loaded w/
  debt and is in trouble.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;code&gt;debt to equity ratio&lt;/code&gt;: &lt;code&gt;= total debt/equity&lt;/code&gt;.  Similar to the
  equity multiplier, I'm trying to understand how bad the company is
  relying on debt. So, if debt is 60%, and equity is 40%, it will be
  6:4=1.5. Therefore, the higher this number is, the more leveraged
  this company is.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;code&gt;liability/asset %&lt;/code&gt;: &lt;code&gt;= total liability/total assets&lt;/code&gt;. I'm assuming
  if the company is liquidating, will its asset enough to pay off its
  liability&lt;sup id="fnref:4"&gt;&lt;a class="footnote-ref" href="#fn:4"&gt;4&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;. Without consideration of discount, relative change
  among periods are still valid.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;period-to-period changes&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;code&gt;debt % of asset&lt;/code&gt;: &lt;code&gt;= total debt / total assets&lt;/code&gt;. Debt is long-term
  liability. Ideally you also need to discount liability for its
  market value, not using its book value. In the example above, about
  50% of assets are debts. Debts are often renewed so a company
  constantly borrows. So my understanding is that a stable % is fine;
  a sudden change will signal health issue or a strategy shift.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;code&gt;debt %&lt;/code&gt;: &lt;code&gt;= growth of total debt&lt;/code&gt; from p1 to p1. Value of the first
  reporting period will be set to 0 as it has no &lt;em&gt;previous&lt;/em&gt;
  one. Similar to the &lt;code&gt;debt % of asset&lt;/code&gt; above, it measures how quickly
  a company is accruing debts. Negative value will be highlighted
  because the debt is decreasing, a good sign.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;code&gt;account payable %&lt;/code&gt;: &lt;code&gt;= growth of AP&lt;/code&gt;. AP is a liability. I feel in
  business AP can grow for two reasons: company is not paying off
  vendors because it's poor, or being greedy to use AP as free deposit
  for interest. AP decrease may either be a healthy sign that company
  has money to pay, or that vendors are losing faith in this business.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;code&gt;account receivable %&lt;/code&gt;: &lt;code&gt;= growth of AC&lt;/code&gt;. The counterpart of AP. If
  it grows, it's a bad sign that customers are not paying.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;code&gt;cash %&lt;/code&gt;: &lt;code&gt;= growth of cash, cash equivalents, and short-term
  investment&lt;/code&gt;. In other words, anything one an quickly turn into cash
  are counted. If it grows, I take it as a positive sign.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;code&gt;working capital %&lt;/code&gt;: as name. Working capital = current assets -
  current liabilities. In other words, this measures how much a
  company needs to keep its business going, like a filler. If it
  grows, then the gap is enlarging, which puts more burden in
  borrowing to get a bigger filler.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;code&gt;net PP&amp;amp;E %&lt;/code&gt;: as name.  PP&amp;amp;E is a long-term investment. It's a
  signal how much they are investing into the future production.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Think about this. If you are going to run away, will u want to
  invest into a factory, or keep cash? So, I think a positive
  change is a good thing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;Income Statement&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;See &lt;a href="https://yahooquery.dpguthrie.com/guide/ticker/financials/#income_statement"&gt;yahooquery doc&lt;/a&gt; for available data points. Again, raw numbers are not helpful. Instead, % of a total is useful, eg. profit margin.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;figure class="col s12"&gt;
  &lt;img src="images/stock/income%20statement.png"/&gt;
  &lt;img src="images/stock/income%20statement%20values.png"/&gt;
  &lt;figcaption&gt;Example of income statement&lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;code&gt;COGS margin %&lt;/code&gt;: &lt;code&gt;= cogs/revenue&lt;/code&gt;. Total cost to bring in that much
  revenue. I'm expecting it to be rather stable if a business is run
  well.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;code&gt;operating income margin %&lt;/code&gt;: &lt;code&gt;= operating income/operating
  revenue&lt;/code&gt;. The higher it is, the higher operating margin there are,
  thus more efficient.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;code&gt;operating expanse margin %&lt;/code&gt;: &lt;code&gt;= operating expanse/operating
  revenue&lt;/code&gt;. These are direct cost to earn those revenue. The lower,
  the better. However, if we look at &lt;code&gt;operating income margin&lt;/code&gt;
  together with this, you will find their sum is not 100%! What is
  missing is the operation overhead.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;code&gt;OPEX margin %&lt;/code&gt;: &lt;code&gt;= OPEX/revenue&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;code&gt;EBIT margin %&lt;/code&gt;: &lt;code&gt;= EBIT/revenue&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;code&gt;total expanse margin&lt;/code&gt;: &lt;code&gt;= total expanse/revenue&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;Cash Flow Statement&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;See &lt;a href="https://yahooquery.dpguthrie.com/guide/ticker/financials/#cash_flow"&gt;yahooquery doc&lt;/a&gt; for available data points. In this analysis,
all values are converted to &lt;code&gt;B&lt;/code&gt;. As a layman, I think the more cash
you have, the better.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;figure class="col s12"&gt;
  &lt;img src="images/stock/cash%20flow.png"/&gt;
  &lt;img src="images/stock/cash%20flow%20values.png"/&gt;
  &lt;figcaption&gt;Example of Cash Flow Statement&lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;code&gt;cash growth from beginning&lt;/code&gt;: &lt;code&gt;= (ending cash - beginning
  cash)/beginning&lt;/code&gt;. This measures how much cash grew in that reporting
  period. I take this as a sign of how profitable the business is.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;code&gt;operating cash from prev %&lt;/code&gt;: how much operating cash grew from
  previous report. I focus on operating cash because it represents
  what this business is about. Income, on the other hand, can be
  generated not through its core business, but some fancy accounting
  or financial activity (eg. bought bitcoin early) &amp;larr; these are
  not what this business is, but luck. So if this index is growing, I
  take the biz is growing stronger.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;code&gt;FCF/operating CF&lt;/code&gt;: how much operating cash ended up being free
  cash. The higher, the less overhead/debt one needs to pay off from
  operating cash flow, thus healthier.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;code&gt;FCF/net income&lt;/code&gt;: a good explanation &lt;a href="https://www.morningstar.com/invglossary/cash_flow_from_operations.aspx"&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If net income is much larger than cash flow from operations, it's a
signal that the company's earnings quality-the usefulness of
earnings-is questionable. If cash flow from operations exceeds net
income, on the other hand, the company may be much healthier than
its net income suggests.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;code&gt;operating CF/net income&lt;/code&gt;: just because.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;valuation ratios&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;These are published ratios taken from &lt;a href="https://yahooquery.dpguthrie.com/guide/ticker/financials/#valuation_measures"&gt;yahooquery&lt;/a&gt;. I'm taking them
on face value as a reference point.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;figure class="col s12"&gt;
  &lt;img src="images/stock/valuation%20ratios.png"/&gt;
  &lt;img src="images/stock/valuation%20ratios%20values.png"/&gt;
  &lt;figcaption&gt;Example of valuation ratios&lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In this example, BFAM's PE grew from 49.76 in 12/31/2019 to now 364.38
on 3/3/2021. Alarming, isn't it!? If accepting this, we are saying
this business grew 7x more valuable in just one year, 2020, and don't
forget 2020 was the Corvid year! Doesn't make sense, does it?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On the other hand, P/B decreased from 9.73 &amp;rarr; 7.76 over the same
period. Therefore, we actually need to find out what these &lt;em&gt;book
values&lt;/em&gt; came from, as it must have grown a lot in 2020. If they are
assets useful for operation, it's a good thing; otherwise, remember,
liability is part of asset also (since debt can actually be sold, thus
has value!). So growing asset can also be that it's taking on more
debts, which, in my opinion, is not a good thing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="footnote"&gt;
&lt;hr&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li id="fn:1"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Whenever there is a published alternative to a computed one, it
will always cast doubt when the two are different. Comparison as
this is an attempt to measure how accurate source data are, and
how accurate my computation is. Even assuming these two are
perfect, a substantial gap would imply that I'm missing
information which the concensus value has included (of course,
here I'm assuming the published value is itself dependable).&amp;#160;&lt;a class="footnote-backref" href="#fnref:1" title="Jump back to footnote 1 in the text"&gt;&amp;#8617;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="fn:2"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Smoothing always troubles me because it can mask outliers
without good reasoning. An outlier can either be a noise that
skews result, or a signal that something is wrong. Overall, I
prefer a business who runs rather like a stable ship, not a bumper
cart.&amp;#160;&lt;a class="footnote-backref" href="#fnref:2" title="Jump back to footnote 2 in the text"&gt;&amp;#8617;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="fn:3"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I thought of building a sensitivity analysis. However, the
general impact of each factor can be understood without using a
specific stock. Further, combination of these factors can grow to
a large matrix, and presenting all of them may seem impressive,
but defeats the purpose making data consumable by a user.&amp;#160;&lt;a class="footnote-backref" href="#fnref:3" title="Jump back to footnote 3 in the text"&gt;&amp;#8617;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="fn:4"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Asset value is using its book value. In reality, this should be
discounted as some assets may have no buyer. Further, intangible
asset such as reputation should be heavily discounted or removed
entirely since I'm really thinking of this in case of the company
being troubled, and then its name won't be worth much.&amp;#160;&lt;a class="footnote-backref" href="#fnref:4" title="Jump back to footnote 4 in the text"&gt;&amp;#8617;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;h1&gt;Backdrop&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The app is a complete rewrite of one which I wrote five years
ago. At the time Jookun approached me that he had some wise strategies
of investment. I was intrigued by his passion, but wanted to verify
its worth using some simulation. Thus a Django was created with Yahoo
finance daily data as the input, and some data crunch based on his
idea. Like all other ideas, I started to come up some of my own while
working on it, and gradually it let me deep down into the rabbit hole
&amp;mdash; for the first time in my career, I had computation so intense
that it would overheat my laptop and had it shut down! I felt I was on
track of something. However, it had then been left to rot
since. Though I had tried to revive it over the years, some of the
code was done in such a complex manner that I didn't have the heart to
read it again. One impression, however, always left me with a hope,
the difficulty â€¦&lt;/p&gt;</summary><content type="html">&lt;figure class="col s12"&gt;

&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;h1&gt;Backdrop&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The app is a complete rewrite of one which I wrote five years

since. Though I had tried to revive it over the years, some of the
code was done in such a complex manner that I didn't have the heart to
read it again. One impression, however, always left me with a hope,
the difficulty of obtain these free daily data. As mentioned, I
started with Yahoo data. However, it was shut down just around that
time. Later I shifted to Alpha Advantage while it was still free of
use. Well, not anymore. Soon after I switched to it, I guess it gained
enough popularity that it went on with memberships and so on. What
jumping through these hoops occurred to me that if I could just
publish these historical data somehow, and let people download and use
them, there are already value.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So recently, I started to think about this idea. Starting with another
round of reviving the old app, I implemented Django command to dump DB
data into CSVs, thus creating 500+ files, each representing a SP500
symbol, which were what I had. However, I want more &amp;mdash; how about
a better user experience? how about some computation of probabilities
based on a layman's observation? how about DCF?... all these,
eventually propelled me to rewrite this from scratch, and here it is.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;Audience &amp;amp; goals&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;First, it is an absolute illusion if a beginner like myself will beat
the market by these analysis, not only because of limitation of
knowledge, information, and experience, but of personality. I don't
know what the winners are like. Internet is filled with articles on
what it takes to be a good investor. I have some of those qualities,
but there is no guarantee nonetheless. Therefore, I'm back to zero.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But one thing I am certain, that everyone will experience what I have
experienced, at some point of his/her life, that they are curious, or
interested in, the stock market, have the itch to try, know some bits
of it, but not a whole lot, and have some basic &lt;strong&gt;hunch&lt;/strong&gt; of some
&lt;em&gt;pattern&lt;/em&gt;, or &lt;em&gt;frequency&lt;/em&gt;, or &lt;em&gt;occurance&lt;/em&gt;, and thought there might be
a gold mine buried underneath and yourself might be the lucky one. So,
how to find out, or to verify?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here are five levels of users I sense:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;table&gt;
&lt;thead&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;th&gt;Type&lt;/th&gt;
&lt;th&gt;Tool&lt;/th&gt;
&lt;th&gt;Audience&lt;/th&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;/thead&gt;
&lt;tbody&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td&gt;1&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;apps &amp;amp; websites&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;Have basic knowledge, satisfied with reported info&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td&gt;2&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;Excel&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;Think they have some data/info analysis edge&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td&gt;&lt;strong&gt;3&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Excel + VBA&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Automate routine computation and data assembly&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td&gt;4&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;Script or lib&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;Programmer who gained more computation power over Excel&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td&gt;5&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;Commercial&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;Professional, sky is the limit, membership&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;/tbody&gt;
&lt;/table&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Difference between 3 &amp;amp; 4 are blurry, but the idea is that
scripting/lib will give you a much wider selection of tools than
VBA. Further, VBA is not as good a building block if you want to stand
on the shoulder of a giant.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Users of type 1 and type 5 are not my audience. User of type 2,3,4 are
essentially the same people &amp;mdash;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;they are independent/self-confident enough to think of their own
  method, but are yet willing to go with a commercial source or
  solution&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;they have some financial knowledge, and&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;are not afraid of (or even fond of) data crunching.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Their routine follows these steps &amp;mdash;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Obtain raw data:&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;daily price (well, you could also have finer grain data)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;financial reports: balance sheet, income statement, cash flow&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;computed ratios, eg. P/E, beta&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;some popular indicator or evaluation values&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Crunch of his own indicator or measure using these data&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Draw a graph here and there to visualize his results&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Search for pattern&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;During my research and implementation, following this pattern, I found
a few places where this tool can help:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Getting data&lt;/strong&gt;. represented the first barrier higher than expected. I have
  related my experience w/ Yahoo, Google, Alpha. I'm surprised how
  limited such data sources are there considering how widely spread
  the Internet has become, and stock data being always in the public
  domain.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A value of this tool is to handle API of available data
  sources so to retrieve available &lt;em&gt;raw&lt;/em&gt; data.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Cleansing data&lt;/strong&gt;. Once you get data, consuming data represents
  another barrier &amp;mdash; understanding particular data form (&amp;larr;
  this is usually source dependent) and handling data anomaly.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;2nd value of this tool is to normalize these data points, and
  potentially amending missing data by providing reasonable default.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Computing standard ratios&lt;/strong&gt;. Crunching a clean data set is usually not the
  challenge at all.  Of course you can go with your fancy where the
  &lt;em&gt;edge&lt;/em&gt; is believed to be. However, there are always a few &lt;em&gt;standard&lt;/em&gt;
  ratios everyone seems to begin with, eg. growth rate of a number
  from period to period, or pcnt of one expanse of the total, things
  like that. They are not difficult to compute, but rather
  mechanical/tedious, and are not readily available from a data
  source&lt;sup id="fnref:1"&gt;&lt;a class="footnote-ref" href="#fn:1"&gt;1&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;. Therefore, you have to do them &lt;em&gt;manually&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Therefore, 3rd value of this tool is to provide some computed values
  out of box. One beauty of historical data is that they don't
  change. Therefore, a pre-calculated result is as good as new.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In short, one can view this tool as a fancy automated Excel template
that I have built to facilitate routine works and get you going w/
your analysis quickly less the mechanical build-up that is necessary
but distracting from analysis itself.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;System design&lt;/h1&gt;

  &lt;figcaption&gt;Stock app high level design&lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;System is split into backend and fronend. Backend is a Django app w/
exposed REST API using &lt;a href="https://django-tastypie.readthedocs.io/en/latest/"&gt;Tastypie&lt;/a&gt;. Frontend is &lt;a href="https://reactjs.org/"&gt;React&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Primary data source is Yahoo's financial data. In particular, I'm pulling these:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;historical stock daily prices &amp;mdash; high, low, open, close, volume&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;financial statements &amp;mdash; balance sheet, income statement, and cash flow statement&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;published meta &amp;mdash; beta, P/E, and so on. Since these are
  opinionated, Yahoo is just one of many alternatives.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;Data model&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Model names are intuitive.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;table&gt;
&lt;thead&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;th&gt;Name&lt;/th&gt;
&lt;th&gt;Description&lt;/th&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;/thead&gt;
&lt;tbody&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td&gt;MyStock&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;Place for name, symbol&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td&gt;MyStockHistorical&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;Daily trading data&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td&gt;MyStrategyValue&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;Pre-computed values based on historical, eg. moving average&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td&gt;IncomeStatement&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;As name&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td&gt;BalanceSheet&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;As name&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td&gt;CashFlow&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;As name&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td&gt;ValuationRatio&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;Published valuation ratios, eg. P/E. They are source dependent.&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;/tbody&gt;
&lt;/table&gt;
&lt;figure class="col s12"&gt;

&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;h1&gt;Data persistence &amp;amp; processing&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Data persistence is MySql 5.7. Using Django's ORM, this is not a hard requirement if your preference is something else.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Data processing is handled by Redis via Celery so to achieve ease of scale. As mentioned earlier, &lt;code&gt;MyStrategeValue&lt;/code&gt; are derived from historicals, thus are computed prehand using this mechanism: Django custom command &amp;rarr; compose celery task &amp;rarr; submit task to Redis queue &amp;rarr; task executed and data is persisted to DB.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There are also custom model property which is computed on the
fly. Most of them can be pre-computed also since historicals are not
static. However, to minimize dependency on these values that must be
prepared as a separate step, I opted to the current method. By
observation, performance penalty by not having them in DB is
acceptable.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Using docker, the following data volumes are used:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;table&gt;
&lt;thead&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;th&gt;Volume&lt;/th&gt;
&lt;th&gt;Attach to&lt;/th&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;/thead&gt;
&lt;tbody&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td&gt;stock-data&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;Main DB data storage&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td&gt;redis-data&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;Redis data storage&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;/tbody&gt;
&lt;/table&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;Network&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Network of the setup is fairly simple. We distinguish &lt;code&gt;data&lt;/code&gt; vs. &lt;code&gt;management&lt;/code&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;figure class="col s12 center"&gt;
  &lt;img src="images/stock/backend%20network.png"/&gt;
  &lt;figcaption&gt;Stock app networks&lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Ports&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A service is a function unit. In this implementation, each is a
docker. I try to limit exposure of ports on docker host so this
application can be easily co-hosted with others without causing port
conflicts. In essence, &lt;code&gt;8084&lt;/code&gt; is the frontend UI port, and &lt;code&gt;8003&lt;/code&gt; is
the backend API port. All others are docker-to-docker only.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;table&gt;
&lt;thead&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;th&gt;Component&lt;/th&gt;
&lt;th&gt;Docker Port&lt;/th&gt;
&lt;th&gt;Service&lt;/th&gt;
&lt;th&gt;Host Map&lt;/th&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;/thead&gt;
&lt;tbody&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td&gt;Frontend&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;80&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;Main frontend app w/ Nginx built-in&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;8084&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td&gt;Backend&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;80&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;Nginx proxy&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;8003&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td&gt;Backend&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;3306&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;MySql DB&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;none&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td&gt;Backend&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;8001&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;Django app&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;none&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td&gt;Backend&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;6379&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;Redis&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;none&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;/tbody&gt;
&lt;/table&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;Develop &amp;amp; Deployment&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Assuming you have &lt;code&gt;docker&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;docker-compose&lt;/code&gt; installed already, clone the &lt;a href="https://fengxia41103.github.io/myblog/drafts/stock thoughts.html"&gt;repo&lt;/a&gt;, and under &lt;code&gt;/backend&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;/frontend&lt;/code&gt;, use the &lt;code&gt;docker-compose up --build&lt;/code&gt; for the first run to build initial images, and &lt;code&gt;docker-compose up -d&lt;/code&gt; for incremental changes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Frontend development can be benefited by a non-docker setup. So you need to &lt;code&gt;npm install&lt;/code&gt; then &lt;code&gt;npm run dev&lt;/code&gt;. Once you are satisfied w/ your frontend code, production deployment can be &lt;code&gt;docker-compose up --build -d&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="footnote"&gt;
&lt;hr&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li id="fn:1"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Some source provide indicators such as MACD. Most, however, only
provide raw/reported data such as sales of an Income Statement. My
goal, therefore, is to follow the conventional train of thought by
converting these values into percentage, and some period-to-period
change rate, and so on, which I found myself doing a lot whenever
I receive an Excel full of numbers.&amp;#160;&lt;a class="footnote-backref" href="#fnref:1" title="Jump back to footnote 1 in the text"&gt;&amp;#8617;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
