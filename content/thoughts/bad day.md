Have you ever been caught in a mode that you just feel the whole life
is collapsing, not necessarily things are really bad, just that you
feel the mind is on a edge pissed off by something at that moment that
you just want to get out, to scream, to even kill somebody!? You will
be like **wtf** let's just bring it on, sink me to the bottom of
whatever life has it for me, trash me to the ground, and better just
kill me so I won't bounce back up again to suffer more by dragging it
on and on and on.....

That's exactly how I feel right now, today! WTF! really? How could
this be soooo damn hard? I just want to move on my life, and here it
is, somehow, somewhere, some dark energy in this universe just want to
anchor me right back to where I am. And seriously, if only there is an
archor in my life, in my mind, wouldn't I have taken this step in the
first place!? Pls, get a grip. Can't u see what is happening!? Why!?
The feeling of being stuck, is just fxxx terrible.

I don't know. Life is hard; marriage is hard; living is hard; being
positive is hard; being sad is hard; being left alone is hard; being
endorsed by people is hard; being yourself is hard; being someone you
like is hard; being someone others like is hard; being the want-to-be
is hard; being the as-is is hard; being, is just hard.
