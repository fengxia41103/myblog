Had a chat w/ a friend yesterday after he showed a snippet of his chat
history, rather more accurately, of his argument history, w/ someone
in his circle about the ongoing corona virus outbreak. The argument
goes something like this:

> Yao: The traditional Chinese medicine is useless.
>
> B: What is your job? (Implying, are you a doc?)
>
> Yao: I'm a nobody, certainly not a medical personnel.
>
> B: Then you have no qualification to make such a claim.
>
> Yao: This is absurd. Why can't I have an opinion even if I had no
> medical training?
>
> B: Cause you don't know what you are talking about.
> 
> So it goes on and on and on....

This is interesting, and actually quite common pattern that I have
witnessed over and over in chats, especially among Chinese. I sense
there is a logic flaw in this pattern, but haven't given it much
thought what this flaw is. But a word suddenly came to me &mdash; 举证
倒置 ([reverse onus][1]), meaning to shift the burden of proof to the
party who is being challenged &rarr; but, in a common sense, I would
expect the challenger to provide the evidence to support the
challenge. After all, I thought I was right, it's you, the challenger,
who is disagreeing w/ me. So why should I bother to prove myself
correct, again!? Wouldn't it even be super biased even if I _do_!?
&larr; that's where it smells funny, isn't it! &mdash; I was told at
some point that this is the foundation of Chinese law, which
essentially assumes you guilty, and it is up to the defendant to prove
him/herself innocent; on the contrary, the US law assumes you
innocent, and it is up to the challenger (the plaintiff) to provide
evidence that you are guilty (that is his/her position, isn't it!?).

Can't find much of this term beyond the legal application. So googled
a bit more, and found that in philosophy, this is called [burden of
proof][2]:

> When two parties are in a discussion and one makes a claim that the

So in both terms, applying to such debate pattern, it means the
challenger, the B in this case, is making a challenge to Y's claim
that the "traditional Chinese medicine is useless", thus it's him/her
obligation to provide evidence/proof for the challenge.

However, apparently something didn't go right, when B immediately
questioned whether Y has medical training, thus if Y fails to **prove
his credibility w/ proper domain knowledge** (and this is a very shaky
ask since, first of all, there is no agreement of definition of this
qualification, second, approval of satisfaction of meeting the
qualification lies now in the hand of the challenger! This is the most
questionable aspect of this pattern!) leading down the path that you
claim itself is questionable if you don't have adequate training. What
went wrong!? .... hmmm.. what's going on here? Two things are mixing
up in this debate now, both, well, by my evaluation, are fallacies on
B's part  &mdash; the [argument from ignorance][3], and [Ad
hominem][4].

# argument from ignorance

First, the [argument from ignorance][3].

A bit hard to read and digest. So let me use a couple common patterns
you would hear from a Chinese medicine lover:

1. **false positive**: I took a Chinese medicine and now my symptoms are completely gone. The medicine cured my symptoms.

2. **absence of evidence**: There is no evidence of Chinese medicine
   causing harm, and therefore, it must be unharmful (or even
   helpful).

I bet these sound familiar to your ears. But then, wouldn't these also
apply to Y's claim that the medicine is useless!? I mean, he can't
conclude it's useless because it _didn't work in one case_ (the false
positive), or that _didn't work because I can't iterate an example
when it worked_ (absence of evidence &rarr; he may not be knowledge
enough of cases when it worked! thus bringing the question of his
professional training as a challenge)!?

Sounds so, doesn't it! Meaning both parties are offenders of this
fallacy by shifting the burden of proof to the other party. But, is it
so? If this is the case, then whoever speaks first (thus stating
his/her opinion) is liable to provide evidence (I think they should),
but will be automatically in a position of playing defense, and since
this is an opinion vs. opinion, no sufficient proof can be provided if
the other party has taken the position to reject this first claim!

On top of this, there is the difficulty of **proving a negative**. As
in this case Y's claiming that the medicine is useless (a negative)
requires him to proof it never worked, which apparently, is not true
(as before the modern medicine, these traditional ones had to play a
part in healing people, whether it worked by chance or by practice,
thus must have successful cases to support its being useful).

# Ad hominem

Doesn't a Latin just add, weight, to the credibility of what I'm going
to say!?... hahaha... don't be fooled by it, just that don't be fooled
by anything just because it is printed in a capital letter or on
paper. Keep up your curiosity and hope you can still follow my lines
so far. 

[Ad hominem][4]:

> 

Here we see the exact strategy (a fallacy) that B has deployed in this
argument, by questioning Y's _medical training_ &mdash; this is the
most prevalent pattern you will observe in Chinese, both the online
_verbal assaults_ between a fan club and their foes, or historically
how they tarnish someone during the Cultural Revolution era &mdash;
once they prove you are a bad person (only in a moral sense, and the
moral standard, of course, if held by the winner, usually the one who
has the biggest fist or the loudest voice), they conclude that
everything of you is now nonworthy!

# summary

So now by examining the debate, there are two problems:

1. On Y's part, he has to seek a different route to prove the
   negative. I don't know how and what it is, but there must be a way
   to do so. Otherwise, the negatives will be un-defeatible!
   
2. On B's part, he attacked Y's credential instead of his claim, which
   is [Ad hominem][4].
   
Now, I'm interested in know, why there are so many argument fallacies
in these common daily exchange of opinions? and how could people, who
are not a student of philosophy, be able to guard themselves against
them? Is there really a pattern that we can express the opinions
freely, while not falling into these traps? And further, don't be an
offender myself?

Hmm......
