<p>I'm in a constant amazement how misconcepted this world is, by me, and
by many many others. Not only of this world as it is now, but the so
called history, things that have happened, have passed, should have
been written in stone, crystal clear, no ambiguity. Yet, when reading
a book like <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/America_and_Americans">this one</a>, it's truly an eye opener that what I
thought I have known, what everybody thinks they have known, were not
so, were, perhaps, forgotten, or, were not understood in the first
place.</p>
<p>Sometimes I feel the history is playing a funny game, that by a common
sense, the longer you wait, usually the more faded the memory becomes,
thus the more likely what was remember became less and less <em>accurate</em>
or <em>reliable</em>, like what I have argued against in <a href="https://fengxia41103.github.io/myblog/china nationalism.html">this article</a>
that many of the Chinese elites are propogating the <em>main stream</em> idea
of China's history with much distortion, which are obviously
<strong>illogical</strong> because they failed in cross checks. But they were
<em>invented</em> anyway so to fit for the needs of the uprising nationalism
sentiment and of course, the needs of the ruling authority at all
levels, whatever the level may be, and whatever the ruler's taste and
preference may be. As the proverb says, 上有所好, there must then be
providers to satisfy it.</p>
<p>But on the other hand, there is another <em>convention</em> that the longer
you wait before looking back, the clearer you will start to see what
was truly the case, because the effect of the even had been known, had
played out, and it's much easier (in theory) to formulate a causal
argument which is both convincing and closer to the truth, even though
I also constantly have the doubt that causal relationship is but
another human invention to assist our perception, and there are, have
been, and always will be, many many casual relationships that can be
formed out of any two events, historical events in particular, because
they can not be tested again, thus are nothing but interpretations,
your words against mine, that kind of deal. Nonetheless, the more
stepped back you are from the event, the more likely you are less
partial about one way or the other, thus giving you a better chance to
be neutral and objective, cool-headed, to cut through the mess and see
the core. But doing so also requires not only knowledge and judgement,
but practice, then, how would one gain practice without first making a
lot of such mistakes? This ask itself is illogical, isn't it? What a
catch 22!</p>
<p>I never read the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Grapes_of_Wrath">The Grapes of Wrath</a>, and didn't know <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Steinbeck">John
Steinbeck</a>. But this <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/America_and_Americans">book</a> is fascinating. I wish I could type
it down because there are so many points I couldn't agree more. More
importantly, the process that America has emerged, how people have
treated <em>newcomers</em>, are the exact same pattern being played out in
China, in a new community, in a team in a company, over and over and
over, thus making me to believe that this pattern is not only common,
but is speaking loud how human groups behave, predictably,
unchanged. Actually everytime I came across a book like this, I can't
help having an urge to go back to school and take on social studies
&mdash; though I am disgusted by human's behavior I witness everyday,
especially during the morning rush hours on the road, I think social
study as a way to research and observe human and human group, is the
much harder task to undertake than an engineering challenge &larr; I
can learn many many of the hard science and math, but I can't get even
a slim grip on human's emotion, desire, reaction, thinking. It's
either that I'm just bad at it, or, they are just too damn hard!</p>
<p>Anyway. Let me type down the first misconception of America, that
people have come to this land to form a paradise on earth with
everybody being a sisterhood or brotherhood, such a friendly place,
friendly people, wonder idea &mdash; wrong, wrong, wrong. And I'm
hoping that by reading this, you will start to question everything you
think you have come to see and hear, and wonder, whether they have
become a misconception:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>It is customary (indeed, at high-school graduation it is a
requirement) for speakers to refer to America as a "precious
inheritance" &mdash; our heritage, a gift proffered like a sandwich
wrapped in plastic on a plastic try. Our ancestors, so it is implied,
gatherd to the invitation of a golden land and accepted the sacrament
of milk and honey. This is not so.</p>
<p>In the beginning, we crept, scuttled, escaped, were driven out of the
safe and settled corners of the earth to the fringes of a strange and
hostile wilderness, a nameless and hostile continent. Some rulers
granted large sections of unmapped territory, in places they did not
own or even know, as cheap gifts to favorites or to potential enemies
for the purpose of getting rid of them. Many others were sent here as
a punishment for penal offenses. Far from welcoming us, this continent
resisted us. The Indigenes fought to the best of their ability to hold
on to a land they thought was theirs. The rocky soils fought back, and
the bewildering forests, and the deserts. Diseases, unknown and
therefore incurable, decimated the early comers, and in their energy
of restlessness they fought one another. This land was no gift. The
firstlings worked for it, fought for it, and died for it. They stole
and cheated and double-crossed for it, and when they had taken a
little piece, they way a fierce-hearted man ropes a wild mustang, they
had then to gentle it and smooth it and make it habitable at all. Once
they had a foothold, they had to defend their holdings against new
waves of the restless and ferocious and hungry.</p>
<p>America did not exist. Four centuries of word, of bloodshed, of
loneliness and fear created this land. We built America and the
process made us Americans &mdash; a new breed, rooted in all races,
stained and tinted with all colors, a semming ethnic anarchy. Then in
a little, little time, we became more alike than we were different
&mdash; a new society; not great, but fitted by our very faults for
greatness, <em>E Pluribus Unum</em>.</p>
<p>The whole thing is crazy. Every single man in our emerging country was
out for himself against all others &mdash; for his safety, his profit,
his future. He had little care for the land; he ripped it, raped it,
and in some cases destroyed it. He cut and burned the forests, fired
and plowed the plains, dredged the beautiful rivers for gold, leaving
a pebbled devastation. When his family grew up about him he set it
against all other families. When communities arose, each one defended
itself against other communities. The provinces which became states
were each one a suspicious unit, with jealously held borders and
duties, tolls, and penalities against strangers. The surges of the new
restless, needy, and strong &mdash; grudgingly brouhg in for purposes
of hard labor and cheap wages &mdash; were resisted, resented, and
accepted only when a new and different wave came in. Consider how the
Germans clotted for self-defense until the Irish took the resented
place; how the Irish became "Americans" against the Poles, the Slavs
against the Italians. On the West Coast the Chinese ceased to be
enemies only when the Japanese arrived, and they in the face of the
invasions of Hindus, Filipinos, and Mexicans. Nor were the dislikes
saved exclusively for foreigners. When dust and economics rooted up
the poor dirt farmers of Oklahoma and pushed them westward, they were
met with perhaps even more suspicion and resentment than the other waves.
