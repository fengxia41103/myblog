<p>Sigh. Life is indeed full of puzzling person and phenomenon that
annoys me and I found myself always wonder why they do that and what I
have done to make them act that way (or regardless what I have done
and do, they are just like that). Why?</p>
<p>The new house is coming together nicely. All the good decisions were
made and the outcome is really satisfying. Bill is a good guy. But
then, communication with him is just not there &mdash; calling him
didn't usually feel welcomed, and calling me always starts 7is in the
morning (regardless the day of the week) and it's always when I needed
to pay him. How, one way, ish. After getting off that annoying phone
conversation with him, I was thinking that this is both entertaining
and annoying &mdash; I thought I'm an angry old man. Well, here he is,
an even angri<strong>er</strong> than I am &mdash; funny, and rude. Oh well well,
no harm done, so be it.</p>
<h1>history, euphemism</h1>
<p>Reading <em>"Practicing History: Selected Essays"</em> by <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Barbara_W._Tuchman#Books">Barbara
Tuchman</a>, I am deeply shocked how terrible track record of
human had been and how ugly
the outlook of current days would be (and already have been). 
It's really disturbing and sad.</p>
<p>The good news is that I found a new word, <strong>euphemism</strong>, I feel it's
exactly the noun I have been searching for to describe those <a href="https://fengxia41103.github.io/myblog/irresponsible response.html">bloated
response</a> of Chinese language I have been complaining about. I'm
not sure I agree with its dictionary description, but I can see the
root of it is that an act of window dressing to make something sounds
<em>prettier, better</em> than it actually is, with a motive of what!? In the
oriental world the common perception is that the drive of saving-face
is a strong argument. But honestly I now fail to see the line between
face-saving and trickery &mdash; by dressing up and avoiding a
clarification of the words in use, I would argue that you are just
giving me a false impression and leading me astray, often with a
deliberate intention of such false effect as the outcome! Isn't this
trickery or what!?</p>
<p>I really enjoyed her words on history because she stated clearly the
words she meant, and her stands on things she discussed. See, this is
what a historian or any profession should do &mdash; a thinker who
questions order given in a broader sense than his/her own job and
command chain, derives an opinion and judgment with your own argument,
and take a stand for question and discussion. It's hard, confusing,
destructive, anti-progress, anti-many-status-quos, but it is
necessary, must.</p>
<h1>technology != True. Period.</h1>
<p>Her words led to think more about my profession &mdash;
technology. Yes I have had this feeling recently that words like
"education", "technology", "science" have been misused as if it's
outlook is unquestionably good and its cause universally agreed! </p>
<p>But far from it I'm afraid. Not only its outcomes have been proven to
be a disaster (in history) in many many places and periods, but its
ingredient and reasoning have been borrowed by too many statements so
they are now universally used, but hardly understood and checked!</p>
<p>Everybody talks about <em>science</em> as if anything now prefix-ed by the
word becomes a <em>valid</em> offer. Really!? I was thinking the Chinese word
xx学, what does it mean!? Is it science? is it research? or is it
knowledge? For science, I think we are talking about a pattern that is
recognized, has predictable output when given a known input. We
believe we know the mechanics that converts the input into output, in
a understandable, documented fashion.</p>
<p>Technology, on the other hand, is far from it. It is nowadays being
used as if itself is the answer to problem. <strong>Not at all!</strong> Technology
is at most a method, and I would even take this further to say that
it is an opinionated implementation of something. What it brings us is
efficiency, what it derives is a query into the <em>problem</em> (if there
wasn't a definition of problem, it will create at one version; if
there is a version to work with, it throws more dimensions at it so we
know more about that <em>problem</em> after) so we get more insights. **In
the end, it is a mechanics to facilitate discussion, not an ultimate
solution as many many Powerpoints are preaching.</p>
<p>In today's atmosphere I feel the equation of <strong>technology=science</strong> is
becoming a conceptual pattern. Even more disturbing is that it has
been extended to become <strong>technology=data, technology=science,
science=True</strong>, therefore <strong>data=True</strong>! Oh mine. I don't even think
euphemism is sufficient to describe this fear of mine &mdash; this is
utterly insane, and false, and unacceptable!</p>
<h1>let me try to argue</h1>
<p>And here is my argument.</p>
<h2>technology</h2>
<p>First, technology is a tool, like a hammer, that we need to first say
<strong>the task is to knock a nail</strong>! Without that, hammer itself is a
neutral, meaningless, piece of metal on a wood stick. It will then
become a weapon if the 2nd piece is now stating <strong>the task is to wave
and knock down that guy charging at you with a katana</strong> &mdash; you
see the point? Technology itself should not be elevated to a
Sainthood. It doesn't deserve it, and it never says so
itself. Technology is a powerful tool, but the user who swings that
hammer and the goal of that swing are what we should be discussing,
questioning, and debating. Throwing the buzz word "based on the latest
greatest technology" is confusing and BS.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Technology is just a tool. It requires a definition of the task to
achieve, and its effectiveness is at mercy of its user.</p>
</blockquote>
<h2>knowledge, truth</h2>
<p>Second, there may not be a truth, but there is knowledge, and the
purpose of gaining knowledge is <strong>not to seek truth</strong>. I don't believe
there is truth, absolute or not (I think in common thinking we also
have an equation of <strong>fact=truth</strong>. I'll accept that definition, then
it still holds that <strong>data!=fact, therefore data!=truth</strong>)
Therefore, it doesn't compute if it is the
goal of anything. What is a knowledge then? I can only think of a
definition that knowledge is a <strong>personal awareness</strong> of (input &rarr; output)
pair (the "&rarr;" stands for a transformation mechanics). Yes, it is
subjective, and it has no right or wrong. I know this sounds quite
strange. </p>
<blockquote>
<p>Knowledge is subjective. It is defined as <code>output =
transformation(input)</code>. Truth, if exists, = facts.</p>
</blockquote>
<h2>data</h2>
<p>It is both funny and sad witnessing Chinese talks swing from
complete ignorance of data and digitizing information (so to gain
conformity, consistency, and efficiency) to these days <em>data
everywhere</em> as if data is a truth. </p>
<p>Of course not! Data is a presentation of information, that's it. You
can certainly point at someone's photo and make statement that he is a
bad guy (you actually mean <em>he looks like a bad guy</em>, or <em>he has a bad
guy's look</em>? I'm not sure even yourself knows which one you meant!?),
but no one is going to take that as fact or <em>truth</em> because it is just
one look of that person's million dimensions, and you didn't even give
the definition of your knowledge equation of  (look &rarr; bad guy)!
See!? You need to define:</p>
<ol>
<li>what is a <code>look</code>?</li>
<li>what is the transformation mechanism?</li>
<li>what is a <code>bad guy</code>?</li>
</ol>
<p>Only then, your statement based on data becomes clear. But no one says
your equation is <em>accurate</em>, <em>valid</em>, <em>correct</em>, <em>True</em>! Therefore,
having data itself does not (in)validate anything. It is an ingredient
to establish a reasoning which always depends on the view point of the
analyst and the process that logics are derived!</p>
<p>Data, has information. But it is not fact (and leave Truth out of this
will be wise).</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Data is another form of information. Information can be used to
reconstruct a fact. But even that is a far-fetched wish because then
who is defining that <strong>fact</strong>?</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I feel it is a lost battle. </p></p>
