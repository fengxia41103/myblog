</figure>

<p>Every since the <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Wuhan-Diary-Dispatches-Quarantined-City-ebook/dp/B086JXGZFB">Wuhan Diary</a>, the style is in fashion. Just a
moment ago I saw another by a cousin's friend, titled "华府日记"
(DC Diary), and it distinctly bears a, style, that I found rather,
strange.</p>
<p>It bears a style of smoothness and, calm, that, amid this Corvid-19
crisis &mdash; essentially a barbarian-at-gate scenario while so
called your fate is out of your hand, and even so called authorities
are as clueless as your own, that appears you are jogging down things
around you, mostly <em>fact-based</em> events, thus reading very much like  a
laundry list of neighbour A next door just died last night, the city
mayor has announced so and so on the news, and myself is running out
of food, and so on and so forth. So it conveys a silent sigh behind
all these words, as if putting a lid on a pot of boiling water. <strong>But,
that's where I find it strange!</strong> &mdash; even though it wants to make
a feeling of the hidden turmoil, it feels artificially,
philosophical. This exact same effect can be witnessed in those Wechat 3x3
photo grids as well. Just how many times your friend(s) posted nothing
but a single photo, or a grid of them, without description? Did you
ever wonder what that means!? To me, it was rather, ridiculous,
because fundamentally it spells an air of superiority, that the author
is saying either "how come you can't grab what I mean (as if I'm
stupid)", or essentially whatever your interpretation can be, s/he can
easily brush it off at will that, "you don't understand", "you don't
get it", or if s/he pleases, "you are my soul mate"... well, both ways
are just the same, the same degree of BS and the same degree of
egoism. In the end, this is just another form of <a href="https://fengxia41103.github.io/myblog/euphemism.html">euphemism</a>, which
<strong>I have deemed the cancer of communication</strong>. However, Chinese, as
far as I know, loves this, and that's why the Fangfang-style catches
on like a wild fire. Sad, honestly.</p>
<p>Another aspect of these diaries brushed me on the wrong side is their
title. Like this one, "DC Diary", makes me feel absurd. </p>
<p>I think these titles are simply a <strong>misnomer</strong>, because this could
very well be viewed as the same fallacy when we make a comment like
"yeah Americans are arrogant", or "yeah all Chinese are good at math"
(see what is wrong w/ such <a href="https://fengxia41103.github.io/myblog/generalization.html">generalization</a>). Apparently, such
statement bears no value if you examine them &mdash; for God sake
there are 300 million Americans, and 1.4 billion Chinese, of course
not all Americans are arrogant, nor all Chinese are good at math. I
think even Noah's age understands that much. So, how representative am
I that my experience is the DC experience!? Don't get wrong. I'm
always an advocate of individual versus some collective identity, that
I love documentaries that speaks of a person, a family, instead of an
era that had no face, no name. I believe this isn't unique to me
&mdash; that's why memorials w/ rows of names, like the ones in the
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_England_Holocaust_Memorial">Holocaust Memorial</a> in Boston, bears such a powerful message that
makes you shiver, cry, that's why <a href="https://fengxia41103.github.io/myblog/funeral.html">one feels the tremendous sadness
seeing others suffer</a>, at least for me. Therefore I truly applaud a
writing of an individual's story that documents the person's
journey. However, these individual stories, when being played out, had
no idea that it was typical or popular or unique or whatever. It was
100% for the person himself, but likely nothing for the statistics. I
believe they only became, iconic, after the fact, that, when looking
in hindsight, we found them <strong>summarized the spirit</strong> so well that is
better than any playwriter could ever invent.</p>
<p>But now, making a title like such is, putting things in a reversed
order! &rarr; we start w/ a thinking that mine is representative, and
that, is what I found it, wrong. This is, if politely, ambitious, if
bitterly, arrogant. I'm sorry. You may not represent the DC
experience. To be honest, you may not represent even your
neighbour. Period. If I were another one living in the same area and
wants to write my own diary for the experience, then what, "DC Diary
No. 2", or a revision? I think to the very least, make it "my DC
Diary", is better, so to limit the scope to your own, and leave some
space for others to share and grow.</p>
<p>Overall, I think these diaries have good intent, but no soul, because
there isn't an opinion, a standing point, that the author is proudly
taking.  I believe the point of writing of such isn't about
documenting a few personal events (a joke we all know is the <a href="https://blog.catherinedelors.com/louis-xvi-the-royal-hunt-and-bastille-day/">Louis
XVI wrote "nothing"</a> on the Bastille Day), but that you felt
something that is boiling inside you, that you would like to take
note, share or not, so that you could <strong>express yourself</strong> in a
writing form (or if you use other means, photo, video, whatever), and
that boil, <strong>is emotion</strong>. A <em>calm</em> euphemism, appears to be deep, but
gives the burden of guessing to the reader, sounds smart, but, well,
you get my point (see, my version of an euphemism!!! hahaha).</p></p>
