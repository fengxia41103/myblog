# solution

[code][2].

I'm forming a pattern on strategy:

- **problem space**: how many numbers we are to search through if
  using brute force &rarr; what is the value of '''n''' in
  ''range(n)''? In this one, problem space ''n=1000''.
- **test criteria**: what type of number we are interested in? &rarr;
  divisible by 3 or 5.

Once you have this, another question usually surfaces is that it is
may not be a good idea or even feasible to search through the entire
problem space, eg. multiplication of two super large numbers &rarr;
this can overwhelm the computer to the point that result is not
reliable anymore. But anyway, it is not the case here. But keep that
in mind.

So once we have determined the summary above, the key is to define
**test criteria**:

```python
def natural_number_divisible(n, d):
    '''Find natural number between [1,n] that is
    divisible by "d".
    '''
    num = 0
    while num < n:
        if num and not num % d:  # num%d=0
            yield num
        num += d
```

With that, the rest is simply a main function wrap:

```python
def main():
    n = 1000

    result = 0
    for d in [3, 5]:
        for c in natural_number_divisible(n, d):
            result += c

    # multiple of 3*5 has been counted twice
    for c in natural_number_divisible(n, 3 * 5):
        result -= c

    # final result
    print result
```
