So the country is entering an emergent mode. Wanted to buy paper
towels on Amazon. Wtf, out of stock. And the infamous TP
rush. Seriously. Seriously? Went to Publix for some foods. Guess what
was gone the most!? Raw meat. No kidding. The items w/ the shortest
shelf life, gone. Are you guys planning for a siege, or a weekend
party? To my biggest surprise, cereal boxes are almost all there
&mdash; so much for caring for children at home, or to survive a tough
time. And there were plenty breads of all kinds, and bakery had all
kinds of cakes &larr; so it will be true then, "let them eat cake" ~~~
This is a joke, a grand joke on this society, and a joke on
mankind... I guess virus has always looked at us as jokes, a group of
self-centered, self-important, ignorant organs, fooled themselves to
think that they are dominating this earth. How pathetic!

There is a true cowardice inside us, not because we are coward, but a
strong tendency of lacking courage in face of aggression, or news of
others being hurt. We used to criticize German in the WWII that
neighbours watching the Jews evicted or even killed w/o doing much, we
used to criticize the Western countries not coming to help the China's
suffering from the Japanese evasion, we used to criticize anyone who
was not donating to people in Wuhan.... however, how could they not
feel that way!? when in today's event, I couldn't feel sadness
imagining families who will now run out of income, or food, or TP!
Honestly, I don't feel them at all. All we are all doing, is to be a
sitting duck in front of an even which we think we have no control
over, nothing you can do about, thus only waiting for the **(un)lucky
draw** when it's your turn, my turn, or someone else's turn. That's
all we are doing, and that's all we think we can do. Is it? or there
is more?

I constantly find it annoying that I start to sense more and more of
things in ourselves, built-ins, that are the dark side of myself which
are violating every single creed on the book, yet, I'm only coming to
realize their existence, while watching others I fail to tell they
even have that epiphany &mdash; and like homework, you could not
progress if you never tell your answer was wrong! Yea, mighty God, or
Buddha, or whoever, please save me, for I'm so important, see how many
TPs I have got!?..... this whole thing, is disgusting! I don't know
what to make of it. You can see what it will be like in a war time,
and truly, how ugly those time were!? Could kindness really survive,
like a flame in a gushing wind, to spread, or to be blown out? We
shall see.

At the meantime, I have some TPs left, one more paper towel rolls,
plenty of everything, books to read, Bunny by my lap, Spring flowers
blooming.... and am thinking to take a ride of the [Route
66][2]. Shall I?
