It's quiet here. Office is deserted due to the upcoming long
weekend. It feels rather strange. Listening to the [song][1] makes me to
think of you, and the days agains. Mr.Makato is still here. He is
always here early in the morning, and leave late at night. Is he is
alone? Doesn't he ever go home? Does he have a home?

I want to see you. This moment of quietness. A scene came to my mind,
that years later when I was still thinking of you, and my kids look at
me and you, and could not figure out what is soo good about you, like
when we look at others' love, you wonder what's so special of that
person to make him/her so hooked to it. For outsiders, it always looks
_unlikely_, but for people who are the subjective, s/he can't help it.
So that's how I am feeling. I can't help it.

Was ready to go home, to pick up Noah early so we can spend some time
together. I can already see his smile if I tell him we can play
computer game together. What a wonderful age! He is so easily
entertained, satisfied, and find so many things, happy, genuinely
happy. When did I lose these on the way to now? I may still have some,
but not a lot left, and is becoming less and less. How sad.

I always think there is a song for any couple, either as boyfriend
girlfriend, or just a one-night-stand. Whatever, there is a song, that
describes the mood, the scene, the feel, the touch, the emotion when
two eyes first met, when two hands first touch, when two bodies first
unite, for the two hearts first soften and melt. Love is wonderful. I
can't think of anything else in life so far that gives you more of a
sensation than when you are in love. I think women are indeed wiser
than men &larr; women recognize this long ago before a man grows to
his maturity and start to realize how wonderful a relationship he
has/had.

Sometimes I try to picture that song. There is one you sent me. I like
it. I thought it is the one. But sometimes I felt otherwise. This, the
one I'm listening, feels more like how I feel. Then there are other
songs, that bring back other memories, feelings, people in the past,
or life in the past, pain or happiness &larr; you know, regardless
what they are, they are always part of you, just like any food you
eat, will eventually become part of you, and any book you read, shapes
your mind, even just a tiny bit, will now inseparable. 蒋方舟 said
"dating with someone is like a ghost story, because you see the
reflections of all his/her previous relationships". How true. So
sometimes I feel I shouldn't have let you go, because the process is
what matters; but still, everytime I start to miss you, I remind
myself how I could have faced otherwise when I'm getting too old for
you, and you have such a full life ahead! No I can't, I can't do this
to you. You are free, and should be free. Live a life as it will give
you, I don't know how good or bad it can be. Forever I wanted to be
next to you so to make sure you are protected, cherished. I will do
that, as a shadow perhaps, so when you fall, ever, that's when you
will feel me again, down below, to catch you.

Bless. Sweet dream, 遥远的，美丽的，不再有音信的，你.
