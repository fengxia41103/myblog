Bike sharing is hot, in China. I had a conversation with 张诚 back in
June hoping to get more insights about this _phenomenon_ than what the
news and online blogs can offer. It turned out he actually pioneered
this exact idea 10 years ago. However, answers I collected were far
from satisfying. 

But I want to say here isn't really about bike sharing itself. There
are far more to this. Let me try to explain.

# lunch is free

First, the easy stuff.  So everyone I have asked and heard has quoted
the exact same reason why they think biking sharing is great &mdash;
<span class="myhighlight"> convenience</span>. And all these
conveniences stand on two facts:

1. you can park the bike anywhere you want. Period.
2. in many many many occasions you can ride it for free or a pocket
   change.
      
My very first (and only so far) experience with it was in Beijing this
June when touring 什刹海. Literally we were scanning for a **free**
bike &mdash; a bike someone has _parked_ there without bothering to
lock it (or the lock just doesn't work). Of course by the end of our
fun, we simply left the bike wherever and walked away, and someone
else continued to _benefit from this free lunch_.
  
Well, if convenience is based on these, I simply could not see how it
can ever sustain. Can you park anywhere? should you park anywhere? if
you can't anymore, is it still useful? It's not rocket science to see
an answer at all:

1. If bikes need to be parked on a dedicated spot, the number of
   population who can still benefit will be **&gt; 0** (for those who
   are close by to those spots), but much smaller than all the current
   hypes think (those spots, regardless its count at the end, are
   certainly much much &lt; **everywhere**).
2. Why do we have parking lot for cars? lanes for buses? sidewalks for
   pedestrians? but a free parking pass for bicycles? Why?
   
Don't you see? It feels good not because it is good (at least not the
ones I saw), but because they loot without penalty. It's not magic,
and certainly not **innovation**, it's the same as a gang walking out
of supermarket without paying &larr; yes, I'm pretty sure anyone in that
gang felt good, at that moment. <span class="myhighlight">Who
wouldn't!?</span> Yes, it is a valid business model for sure, and a
pretty good one, too (think of the ROI! wow!), just don't connect it
with words such as progress, innovation, even civilisation. Have some
decency, will ya?



It's not funny anymore when they start debating on regulation, 
whether the government
should intervene (I think not), and who bears cost of messed up
public resource (tax payer of course), and will private companies
eventually come to order (with a hope of four or five winners after
competition, but then, wouldn't we worry about anti-trust if only a
few players left?), and so on..... sure, all good thin kings.

But, here lie the two things really alarmed me.

1. Private company, on one hand cries for government absence so they
   can _compete in free market style_, but then, the every next
   sentence is to ask government to _bear responsibility_ to regular
   rouge bikers who stole bike, break locks, ride without pay, or park
   without social consideration for others... excuse me!? So you have
   the all the fun and government does all the hard, dirty work!? How
   wonderful! Sounds great, doesn't it? Seriously.
   
2. [Last mile][1].

# last mile, and tuk tuk

It is absolutely the most agreed upon assumption that no one ever challenged in
all these talks and debates &mdash; [last mile problem][1]. They all
started by saying all the quirks are byproduct to solve this problem. 
Great, let's talk about this.

[Last mile][1] is a valid problem, a tough one, also an old one. I thought we
had a quite workable solution &mdash; does anyone
remember [tuk tuk][2]?  Seriously, this form of transportation caused
so much trouble back then, that government tried over and over to
squash it without success &rarr; which can only mean one thing, that
the demand is there, and the service meets that demand quite well.

Well, then why didn't we want them flourish back then? Whatever the
reasons you can come up with, all you need to do is to replace the
word **tuk tuk** with **bike**.. you get my point. I would even argue
that **tuk tuk** should be theoretically **safer and better** than bike because:


1. these drivers' living is depending on it &larr; who will mess up
   his own dinner on purpose? A few, but not many.
2. these drivers have a lot more practice on the road than us **casual
   bike riders**, especially considering the road condition you will
   encounter where crazy cars and pedestrians are everywhere &rarr;
   fundamentally, <span class="myhighlight">practice makes it
   perfect</span>, like everything else. Period.
3. didn't I already say it creates employment for _low skill workers_?
4. owner cares about their equipment; renters, worse; for things
   you get for free!? well well. So as an overall social resource (I'm
   counting all the metals and how quickly they depreciate), tuk tuk's
   utility efficiency is higher (no data to support, just my guess).
5. tuk tuk knows his routes better than most of us, gets A &rarr; B
   faster, save time &rarr; has anyone calculated how many equivalent
   hours tuk tuk drivers contributed to this world, comparing to cars,
   bikes, buses? Isn't time a valuable measure!?
6. road has finite capacity, same width can accommodate more tuk tuk
   than cars &rarr; another efficiency win, for public goods (roads).
7. market segment. One extreme is a full-blown car that has comfort
   and speed; the other extreme is bike that is slow and has no cover rain or
   shine. Why shouldn't there be sth in between!? sth that has
   reasonable speed, has cover for rain, and hey, I don't need to
   pedal myself either.
8. safety for girls. Getting in stranger's car (taxi) is the same as
   getting in a stranger's tuk tuk. At least you can shout HELP or
   jump off easier from tuk tuk than from a car since it doesn't have
   doors.
9. .....


So, while all these ppl are arguing left and right about bike sharing,
and whether it is _leasing_ or _sharing_, I found it just completely
irrelevant. This is my engineer instinct, perhaps. When someone
preaches about a **wonderful cure-all magic bullet**, I want to know:

1. what alternatives there are, and
2. why a horizontal comparison derive that yours is better?
3. on what indexes
4. how you evaluate them, and 
5. has anyone successfully repeated your evaluation with the
   same/similar conclusion?

<span class="myhighlight">For market believers, the key isn't at having many companies
selling the same type of service, but to have difference services for
ppl to choose from.</span> Last mile, is like you want a dessert at the end
of a meal, what if all restaurants in this world can only serve you
cheesecake?

So when cheesecake salesmen are debating whether mine tastes better or
how many cheesecake we should all make, they are not only **not
creating a solution**, they are **imposing themselves in a moral
highland** as if the only dessert you should have is a cheesecake.
**These debates are, therefore, nothing but a big middle finger of `F you`.**
