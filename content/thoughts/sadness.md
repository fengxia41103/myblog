Yao Han introduced me to this [movie][1], at the time when we first
met and were in love. I was 27, she was 19. I don't know how many
times I have watched, listened to, and dreamed of, this movie. Each
time it touches me deeper and deeper, makes me wonder why two people
would love then go apart, marry yet think back, miss the other person
but continue to live a life without him/her. why?

It's a wonderful movie, a wonderful story. The guitar at Chen Li's
funeral always gets me, every, single, time. It's beautiful, it's sad,
it is a memory one can only dare to look at when the memory is about
to disappear forever, still pains, still hurts, still live, still
real.

I don't know. Sadness, a boundless ocean of sadness, surrounds me
when the music plays. I was talking to Noah's mom last night that I
don't get overwhelmed in emotion, thus I hardly found myself cry.

But this one, gets me, every, single, time. If one day I fall
into a coma, play the music, the piece when Chen Li wrote a letter to
Xiao Rou, confessing her thoughts for the last time, I will answer,
for it reaches deep inside, that I, will tear, will sigh.
