I must have listened to [this][1] before, maybe years ago. I don't
remember much, but it wasn't unpleasant.

But not this time.

After talking about [China's nationalism][2] on the rise, it has
picked up pace and become an avalanche. The most recent episode is the
launch of [this movie][3], Chosin Reservoir. I haven't watched this,
but it is nothing but a propaganda. Let's just leave it at that.

This [talk][1], however, really disturbed me. Not that its content is
truthful or not. It's the audience. In particular, it's when and at
what they laughed. I never realized how revealing watching someone's
laugh could be. But this is a lesson I should have learned early in
life, but now isn't too late, either.

When the talk spoke there were two options for the Russian ambition to
acquire a usable harbor &mdash; one in China, and another in Korea, he
paraphrased a line by the China's ambassador to Russian back then as a
proof that China also saw the issue clearly &mdash; "Well, since there
are two options here, if you can't get mine (the Chinese), why not
consider the Korea's?"

What a smart line! But then, the audiences laughed....... this, make
my heart ache. What a shameful moment it is! Yes. It is absolutely
shameful to think this line smart, even entertaining, and it was
absolutely shameful for such a proposal offering someone else's
property for yours because you were then getting robbed. Shame, total,
shame.

Then, it is a shame, on all the audiences who were excited by this
line, thought this a smart idea, and laughed &mdash; even if they did
burst in laugh at the beginning, I wished they would then feel a chill
on their back right after, because what they just did is exactly what
all the shameful moments in history had been &mdash; when oneself is
threatened, it seems a super common strategy to shake off the threat
is to offer the guy next door for the sacrifice. I heard the Inca
sacrificed human. I wonder whether, then, neighbors turned onto each
other.

But I do have heard that people did that, when in East Germany, when
in the Cultural Revolution, when in the concentration camp.... if
self-preservation is the ultimate survival instinct, is there a line
one should not even cross even in the direst situation?... I
doubt. But then, I still believe such an act deserves a guilty
feeling, deserves a regret, and deserves an agony of conscience, if it
had happened.

Yet, indeed many laughed. Chilling, isn't it? Think of what one would
find funny, you see the true inner side of this person. There is a
saying that the core of a comedy is tragedy. This is very true &mdash;
when we laughed the proposal to swap Korean in the rape, it's
certainly a tragedy for Korea. But don't you see this is also a
tragedy for ourselves!? It is not only a tragedy, it is also sick.

So, during our youth we all learned that China had reputation of being
the sick man of Asia in the 19th and early 20th century. Now, I have
to say, its mind, and heart, still are. Total shame.
