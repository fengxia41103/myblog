<p>Came back from party. Met w/ good friends for some food and
card. Towards the end I just snapped. I don't know why I got so tipped
off by the saying. Maybe it's the "I don't care", which sounds to me
always like a BS, because this exact same words can be applied
mutually, if it has any validity. Isn't that we could all say the same
thing to each other, if we don't wish things to work out? Therefore, I
don't see any value in this line except as nothing but a moral high
ground in an argument in order to win.</p>
<p>I don't know. Noah's mom said the same thing before, while she was
frustrated and was trying to find a way of comfort. She said the only way
she found not get hurt by me was to tell herself not to care. I
couldn't understand this at all at that time. Now over these years I
start to apply this line in my own life, and is certainly useful to
deflect many unpleasant thing or people &mdash; just tell myself I
don't care, then that doesn't hurt as much any more.</p>
<p>But again. What is this? This line always feels like a selfish choice,
or a self-defence choice, when I have nothing to offer anymore, when I
don't want to think for others anymore but for myself. Then I retreat
into my own shell, shut the door, and tell myself they are not worth
my caring anymore. This seems to be more of a strategy for the weak,
but not of a wise, and certainly not of a strong. Maybe secretly I
wish myself to be strong, to be brave, to have a gut to stand up, thus
don't like the line and its tone. Maybe I'm frustrated not of the
friend who said this, nor of the line itself even, but of myself, of
an image of self which I am not achieving, and perhaps never will
achieve. I recall first time hearing this from the college buddy who
is a Shanghai native, that 关你屁事 关我屁事. I found it puzzling,
rude, and laughable. Yet, years later now, I would almost say that my
advice to anyone would, and should, only be this phrase &mdash; 关你屁
事 关我屁事 &mdash; this sums it all, of the entirety of life and this
world, of its complication, of its puzzling way of running, of how one
could ever navigate through its course without feeling destroyed by
emotion, without being lost, and without being bullied by its
unfairness and its seemingly always backwards reward issues in which
the kind, the lovely, the beauty, the innocent are taken advantage of
by the dishonest, the selfish, the manipulative, the rude, the unkind,
the cold heart, the seekers of benefit, and the thief of the heart.</p>
<p>But. If this is the only defence I could have, I still feel painful to
exercise this however effective and protective it might be. When I
can't feel the pain, what of me left anymore? If there is no judge and
feeling of right and wrong, what's of a reference to act, everyday? If
there isn't an emotion of joy, love, pity, disgust, disappointment,
betrayal, desire, wish to have but had not, wish to gain but had not,
wish to help but had not, then, what's of me, anymore? I don't
know. Sometimes I think these are the same as bravery, that you choose
to suffer so that u know the nerve is working, to be unhappy so that u
know u can feel happy, to be torn by emotion so that u know u can
still love, care... but sometimes I also think they are pretty
pointless in practice sense, that suffer isn't to make you stronger
but weaker, unhappiness isn't to make you more sensitive but more
dull, emotion isn't to make you interesting but unwise, like
tonight's.</p>
<p>I don't know. I feel very sorry the other friends had to go through
this which I created. Even when the motivation was to make everyone
happy, I ended up taking an act that makes everyone the
opposite. Ironical, isn't it!? I don't know. Should I have commented
it, or not? Should I have voiced the opinion, or not? Should I be true
to our feeling if the snap is itself a possibility and now a reality,
or not?.... I don't know what the answer should be. There isn't any, I
would guess. I'm just mumbling here with a cloudy mind, and a cloudy
day, a cloudy evening when thunder could be heard close, and a cloudy
mind that reasons without reasoning, a chaos.</p></p>
