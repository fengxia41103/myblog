Have you ever felt, that someday, there is a song, that makes you
think of, someone? And this song, always, always, reminds of, of that
person, regardless how remote and how far it has been. Somehow, this
person, is tied to this tune, to a scene in your head, in your memory,
that you can still recall the moment you first heard it, as if the
first time you met him/her, the first time you went out, the first
time you had fun at park, playing arcade, watching a video, sharing a
dessert, drinking coffee, window shopping, or just wondering around in
the city, by the suburb, along an unknown road that led to somewhere,
but neither of you cared, because it was the moment being next to each
other mattered, and you could go anywhere with him/her, however where
the road is going to lead.

Isn't it love? or just a 心动? or it's the beginning of a love, that
is always beautiful, touching, making your soul nervous, tremble even,
and leave a stamp on your memory, that you can not forget, even when
it's buried deep, in history, in the past, in neglect, in a corner of
mind that doesn't see light of the day anymore.

Yet, the song, is like a key, that opens a door that had been sealed
with dust, letting light peek into once more, as if someone stepping
into an ancient ruin, they see spider webs, see things scattered
around, see broken pieces here and there, and then, they also see the
same as it was left &mdash; placed in the same place, in the same
position, clock stopped in time, nothing changed, but everything has
changed, gone.

How sad! So this is the power of a song, the power of remembering what
you had, the power of not being able to forget. There is an army of
sci-fi movies that travel back in time or forward into the
future. It's a cliché now if you set a story in this setting. But what
people often do not realize is that, everyone of us, every mind that
lives and breathes, every heart that has ever been touched by another
body, every tune that makes you sad, makes you wonder, makes you want
to drop everything you ever had, only if you could be back with, or to
be with, someone, somewhere, someday, is traveling, in space, in time.

Yes, it is sad. But it is also beautiful, because it is tender, it is
sensitive, it is what makes you feel to cry, and I have to say, tear,
is a wonderful thing. It's not cowardish to cry. It is rather noble,
for you still feel the pain, still remember the pain, still hope it
could have been different, even though it is set, done, finished, no
going back. 

They say Athena put HOPE as the last gift in Pandora's box as a savior
to human; some argue that HOPE is just another evil (so don't be
fooled by its name), otherwise why it was in that box? I don't
know. Maybe it is. Then this is an evil that gives you a string to
hang on, even though, it is false.
