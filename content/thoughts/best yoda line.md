Slug: best yoda line
Author: Feng Xia

Noah wrote a sheet he titled `best yoda line from the clone
war`. It's both philisophical, sophisticated, and cute. He has also
said quite a few things recently that shocked me.

# Episode 1: taking a trip

> Me: do you want to go on a trip with me?
> Noah: No (firmly)
> Me: (surprised) why not!? You don't want to take a trip with me?
> Noah: No I don't (firmly)
> Me: (huh) why don't you then?
> Noah: cause 我不想怒你
> Me: ....

# Episode 2: fuss

On the way driving back from a bookstore on a cold winter weekend (and
he was coughing and wheezing a bit over the weekend so something was
looming). So I proposed to stop by Lake Johnson for walk (and to kill
time), and his origami yoda said "No" (and we in the end lost the
origami yoda, which made him really upset ~~). 

> Me: let's go to Lake Johnson
> Noah: No, my origami yoda says No
> Me: but but, I want to go Lake Johnson
> Noah: (pause) fine, we can go Lake Johnson, because I don't want you
>   fuss at me
> Me: fuss at you? (first time heard him saying this word, `fuss`)
> Noah: yes
> Me: what do you mean? (I found this really funny, and cute)
> Noah: cause you will fuss at 我 if I don't go, and I don't want you
> fuss at 我
> Me: hahaha, 我怎么fuss at 你了?
> Noah: (persona my voice) I don't want your help. The best help is when
>   you take care of youself... 我是在学你,you said to我
> Me: hahahaha... 
> Noah: and I know you were angry, cause you say that when you are angry
> Me: (this is just hilarious)
> Noah: and it makes me feel like an idiot
> Me: (oh, no, now I feel very sorry)

# Episode 3: love

Driving to work in the morning, forgot what topic we were discussing,
I was conjuring up something _funny_, but before I said it:

> Noah: I don't want to hear
> Me: what!? what do you not want to hear!?
> Noah: I know you are thinking about something
> Me: what!?
> Noah: ok, say it
> Me: ..... then just dispose you (I mean to tease him that I'll throw
>   him out the car, I think)
> Noah: what do you mean by _dispose me_?
> Me: kick you out of the care
> Noah: mom is gonna kill you
> Me: huh? what do you mean?
> Noah: 妈妈会kill你 for kicking me out of the car
> Me: why?
> Noah: because she won't let me die
> Me: wow, what do you mean?
> Noah: cause she will not let me die in front of her
> Me: why not?
> Noah: (pause) because she loves me
> Me: what about 爸爸? 爸爸也love你啊.
> Noah: True (reluctantly). But sometimes you make fun of 我, and make
>   me feel to punch you ...
> Me: (*&#(*^*&$#)(&$(*#&($))))
