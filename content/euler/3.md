# solution

[code][5].

I certainly learned a lot from this seemingly simple question!

- **problem space**: `int < 600851475143`
- **test criteria**: is prime?

First of all, how to determine a number is a prime? [primality
test][2].  The easiest [trial division][3] is the only one I was able
to grasp after reading all the others. 

Further, problem space is not what seems &larr; it can be reduced to
`sqrt(n)` when searching for prime factor of `n`! The [Sieve of
Eratosthenes][4] looks really cool, but I couldn't quite yet figure
out how to implement this in code (well, I'm sure there are code
snippet out there that has done this. But I want to come up one
myself. Therefore, it requires me to fully understand this method in
order to translate this into code I can write.)

Here goes the trial division primality test:

```python

def is_prime(n):
    if n <= 1
        return False
    elif n <= 3:
        return True
    elif n % 2 == 0 or n % 3 == 0:
        return False

    i = 5
    while i * i <= n:
        if n % i == 0 or n % (i + 2) == 0:
            return False
        i += 6
    return True
```

## method 1

So we then search for the next prime one and one until we find all
of them, then `max(list of primes)`?

```python
def next_prime(max_prime):
    i = max_prime + 2
    while not is_prime(i):
        i += 2
    return i

def method_1(n):
    """Method 1 is searching for the largest prime factor from bottom
    up. Starting with the smallest prime number, 2, we divide target
    as much as possible to reduce it, then move on to the next prime
    number and repeat. The remainder, if is a prime, is the result.
    """
    primes = [2, 3]

    while n > 3 and not is_prime(n):
        if n >= primes[-1]:
            primes.append(next_prime(primes[-1]))

        for p in primes:
            if n % p == 0:
                while n > p and n % p == 0:
                    n = n / p

    print 'max prime', n

```

## method 2

That's a waste! There is a smarter way to this problem.

1. max problem space is `< sqrt(n)`
2. What is **n's prime factor y**?  &rarr; `n` is divisible by `y`! So
   if we ever find a `y`, we can reduce `n` by `n /= y`. This
   will shrink problem space each step we take.
3. next, instead finding prime factors, we are to **eliminate** all
   non-prime factors! If given a divisible prime, say `2`, we can
   keep looping `n /= 2` until it is not divisible by 2 any
   further. 
   
     This would have eliminated all factors that are multiple
     of 2. By this point, `n` has probably been reduced quite a
     bit. 

     Next, search for the next divisible, 3. If we search starting
     with 2, we are guaranteed that next divisible, if exist, would be
     a prime! &rarr; therefore, the problem reduces to looping in this
     fashion until `y` is not divisible by reduced `n` anymore. What's
     left of `n` is the largest prime factor!

```python
def method_2(n):
    """Method 2 follows the same logic as method 1's. But its
    implementation is much simpler. We simply searching from 2 and up
    until we find the result. In between, we don't search for the next
    prime as method 1 does. Instead, we step by +1. Since the search
    is from bottom up, only the next prime will possibly yield a %==0
    anyway, so it's the same as method 1's.
    """
    i = 2
    while i * i < n:
        while n % i == 0:
            n = n / i
        i = i + 1

    print (n)
```

## performance

* Method 1: **2.97s**
* Method 2: **0.056s**
