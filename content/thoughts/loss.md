Today, Noah walked out the door, left, as a big fxxk you right to my
face. I'm really hurt.

The whole thing started that I prepared breakfast in the morning,
calling him coming downstairs to have breakfast. He came down in
T-shirt, walked to the screen door, "oh it's cold" (it's about 61
degrees outside), then went upstairs. I supposed he wen to grab a
sweater. Waited for a few more minutes, called him again, and from the
sound of it, I thought he went back to reading his book.

Then I got really turned off by him saying one thing and doing another
(yes we have had many conversations regarding this, but so far, no
improvement). So I went upstairs, and said that he could just dress
and go outside and play all day, and I didn't want to see him
during... and then I went back downstairs, put my food on the table,
and started eating. 

After maybe 2 minutes, I went into to look for him, and he was,
gone. Mom got up, got panicked, screamed, slammed doors, rushed to her
car, and the kid was nowhere to be found. 

I tried to stop her from driving in that condition because it won't be
safe. But of course, all the blame was on me. Then I searched the
neighbourhood, searched the house again, he was just nowhere to be
found.

Then came back, found a text message from his mom, that he is
found. And then she came back grabbing her wallet. I asked where he
was, and she said he walked "according to my instruction, and to
become _self-disciplined_ as I have asked him to do", without his
shoes on... so again, it's all my fault.

What a fxxxking joke!

After a few hours both came back. The kid has been hiding upstairs
without saying a word to me, without an apology, without nothing. How
typical of him, that he never had apologized for his doing! and the
mom always criticized me that I'm using the prospective of an adult to
"push him", therefore, the message is that I'm giving him too much
pressure, and I'm the problem that caused all these troubles, and his
miseries.

I'm marking this day as the official day I decided to walk away from
this kid and this family. No more. I'm hurting them as much as they
are hurting me. No more. I'll work on my place, and soon, when I move
away, I will be, gone.

Maybe Jessie was right after all, even she was just joking, this kid
is a loss, time to work on the next one.
