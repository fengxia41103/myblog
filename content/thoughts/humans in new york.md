It has been a while that a book can hit me like that. Maybe it's still
true that images are more powerful to me than words, like that
[funeral pic][1] I bumped into on a China trip. And here it is, two
sets of books I grabbed from the Nice Priced Books yesterday, really
out of nowhere ans I didn't even remember where and how I found them!
Yet, for the first time in my life, I felt, a human being, I mean, a
stranger, can bring warmth, to me.

These portraits are not photographically perfect at all, not even in
focus sometimes, and in some I feel there were too much colors, and
the subjects tended to be a lot of old people, young kids, gays, a bit
like a focus on the population that are inherently weak and vulnerable
in the society, thus easier to evoke a strong feeling of sympathy,
admiration, and so on... But for this book itself, I will not call it
a cheap sell, because I feel the photos genuine, so were the comments,
there are a few that I feel are being asked to pose in a certain way,
but overall, like its title, it's a human story, and it's the human,
that shines through these pages, w/ a picture, or not, with a perfect
smile, or not, with a balance of any agenda, or not... so is human,
not perfect, so is society, not perfect, so is life, not perfect.

These photos were extractly randomly, actually, from the book, while I
was chatting w/ a friend about this book. So I just took some photos
to show her, and had a few comments to share my thoughts of them. I'd
like to save them here because, as a set of _random_ samples, they are
actually as good as the album itself. In the end, it's not the photo
that touches you, it's the thought, the moment, an echo, that lingers
in the mind, that, will not go away.

What a style, both of them!! These are incredibly pleasant to my eyes
even though I agree all little kids are cute, but the boldness and
confidence of the one on the right! Bravo!

Doesn't all adult have such a moment? &mdash; that you remember
something important, someone important, you, even didn't crash, but
will lower the head, not with pride, but with regret? That's how I
feel, and I felt the stuck inside.

With a growing age, I start find myself more and more admire youth,
their energy, their boldness, their possibilities. Yet, I often felt
totally disgusted by the shallowness and
I-want-that-because-everybody-has-it kind of trend chasing
taste. Especially when listening to Chinese shows and sometimes their
articles, I felt even compelled how superficially happy they are all
trying to appear &larr; I don't mean to preach that life is hard kind
of talks. Rather, I felt a disappointment that such a wonderful mind
is wasted by directing his/her focus to those BS. And here it is, a
beautifully phrased statement I truly felt it's the strength of youth,
and youth alone, can, and should, claim. She, is beautiful.

What is humanity? a sympathy? a willingness to help, to share, and to
care? If skateboard has been an icon of youth who spent hours outside
home, hanging out w/ friends, and not studying, then I learned
something entirely new to me, today. Not only I'm charmed by her
smile, but am won wholeheartedly by her mind. What a noble idea!

Guess what popped into my mind then? 匠人... how, unromantic was I!!!!
I really like the answer, because myself wish to know what is
important, and what is not, so that I don't end up wasting the
remaining of this life but for something worthwhile, such as catching
a fleeing moment, a changing shadow.

I don't know which character is this in Kafka's novels. Tried to read
one the other day, [the Trial][2], couldn't finish it. I remember in
college reading [the Chess Story][3], very, agonizing story, that the
guy was playing chess in his own mind and was driven rather crazy if I
recall. I'll probably revisit these books someday. Later in life? I
don't know. I don't whether aging will help to understand them. I do
think the puppet show's markups are magnificantly done.

It's a cliche that gay are good at style and dressing up. Just look at
this! This is far more than a style, but rather, a point of view of
this world, that here I am, and I think I am beautiful.

This, made me want to cry. Yes, I thought of my dad &mdash; yes, the
mind can be gone. But, there is still the heart.

A letter from boyfriend, a letter from prison, hand written... except
the prison part, that will be me, and I wish my letters were also
happy letters, to the one who read them ~~
