All of sudden last night I started to realize what is wrong w/ the
Chinese logics, and why Chinese language env today is so polluted with
such even though they all appear to be so, correct &mdash; because the
usage of proverb which has been inherited from so-acclaimed hundreds
or even thousands of years of historical development, is fundamentally
**flawed** in the sense of communication, and **in particular**,
debate.

> Because it does not define a **context**!

Yes, it does not. Take any proverb you are familiar with, or that you
have used as a roll-off-your-tongue in your recent conversation so to
back up an opinion (yes, it is always used in a context of an opinion,
**always**), because their trademark is short (usually a 4-word
phrase) and supposed concise, it has been honored as a wonderful term
of capturing a large amount of info into a small body of text, and
means to be shooting the arrow right on the bullseye, always.

However, that's the exact the problem. With a short body of text, it
provides no ramp for building the context of this phrase except of its
historical background/story, which is meant to be drawn as a parallel
by the listener or the speaker, to what is being talked about right
now. But, by doing so, it defines, yes, I want to emphasize the word
**define**, absolutely nothing of its appearance in the sentence. So
called 只可意会不可言传, which relieves the burden of the speaker
him/her-self of providing the definition, thus the clarity of its
logical reasoning between point A &rarr; point B, while at the same
time as an evidence to support a statement &lrarr; this is the exact
logical fallacy of the [burden of proof][2]!

Therefore, when everybody, and I do mean everybody, regardless of the
level of education, have been acquaint with these phrases since
childhood, have been using them all over the place in their daily
interaction w/ this world, and the phrases themselves have been viewed
as one of the crown jewels of tradition (&larr; I do want to write
about this word, "tradition", someday, because I feel this is such an
abused word that it becomes a garbage bag of a catch-all, which again
is proliferated in today's China in many aspect of its society, for
example, legal, and it's really really really sad, and bizzare), such
fallacy is then became a label of honor, a way of showing off, like
someone's Gucci bag, a vanity tag! &mdash; so called _educated_,
_sophisticated_, _elite_ member of this society, if you could easily
toss around a few of these proverbs mingled into your lines, as if it
itself is a no-need-to-prove truth, so that it makes whatever the
point you are making, also valid.

But, I'm sorry, ladies and gentelmen, fallacy is
fallacy. Period. Having a billion people doing it doesn't make a
fallacy a correct logic. It only shows the deficiency of awareness of
such fallacy, and the lacking of self-awareness that you look back at
what you just said, trying to pull yourself out of the subjective view
point, as a bystander, to listen, view, think over the same line you
just said, see if there are holes in it &mdash; and 99 out of 100 of
times you will find it not so robust, unfortunately (this is another
topic I'd like to research more, which, as of this moment, I think
it's due to the flaw of human language, that it itself lacks
capability to define clarity).

Therefore, the challenge in communication today, regardless the form,
is that many times the definition/clarity of the word is **not
precise**, perhaps except math symbols. We need more, context, that
before an opinion is expressed, a statement is made, we need more
words in front it, adj & adv, to define the scope/context/background,
and in statement to make the reasoning, logical link between your
evidence to your statement as clear, precise, engineering like
(meaning, be factual &mdash; measurable, thus defeatible), as
possible, not its opposite!

These proverbs are, literacy &mdash; they convey an emotion, a thing
that passed down over time to our inheritance. But they are actually,
IMHO, in the same category as the Bible, or any religious scripts
&mdash; they are interpretated by priest, good for some Sunday
pleasures, spiritual peace and meaning-of-your-life psychology
goad. So next time you use proverb, or hear one, pray is a better
fitting reaction to it than applause &mdash; yes, awe its beauty, its
power, its history. But you walk out a church, you still need go to
your job, earn the living, eat McDonald's, beat the
traffic... proverbs don't put dinner on the table, and now I hope you
could see its limit, and where they actually belong &mdash; church,
cult, your prayer, and that's about it.
