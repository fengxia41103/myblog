<p>Don't take this as an April Fool's trick. Seriously, I'm also alarmed
how I could have changed, a 180 degree turn, from disliking this guy,
Bill Gates, when I was young, to today, I'm taking him as a role
model, and if he runs for president, I'll vote for him.</p>
<p>An <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/opinions/bill-gates-heres-how-to-make-up-for-lost-time-on-covid-19/2020/03/31/ab5c3cf2-738c-11ea-85cb-8670579b863d_story.html#comments-wrapper">article</a> by him on Corvid-19, simple, precise,
to the point, "Bill Gates: Here’s how to make up for lost time on
covid-19":</p>
<blockquote>
<p>There’s no question the United States missed the opportunity to get
ahead of the novel coronavirus. But the window for making important
decisions hasn’t closed. The choices we and our leaders make now
will have an enormous impact on how soon case numbers start to go
down, how long the economy remains shut down and how many Americans
will have to bury a loved one because of covid-19.</p>
<p>Through my work with the Gates Foundation, I’ve spoken with experts
and leaders in Washington and across the country. It’s become clear
to me that we must take three steps.</p>
<p>First, we need a consistent nationwide approach to shutting
down. Despite urging from public health experts, some states and
counties haven’t shut down completely. In some states, beaches are
still open; in others, restaurants still serve sit-down meals.</p>

<p>Through my work with the Gates Foundation, I’ve spoken with experts
and leaders in Washington and across the country. It’s become clear to
me that we must take three steps.</p>
<p>First, we need a consistent nationwide approach to shutting
down. Despite urging from public health experts, some states and
counties haven’t shut down completely. In some states, beaches are
still open; in others, restaurants still serve sit-down meals.</p>
<p>Even so, demand for tests will probably exceed the supply for some
time, and right now, there’s little rhyme or reason to who gets the
few that are available. As a result, we don’t have a good handle on
how many cases there are or where the virus is likely headed next,
and it will be hard to know if it rebounds later. And because of the
backlog of samples, it can take seven days for results to arrive
when we need them within 24 hours.</p>
<p>This is why the country needs clear priorities for who is
tested. First on the list should be people in essential roles such
as health-care workers and first responders, followed by highly
symptomatic people who are most at risk of becoming seriously ill
and those who are likely to have been exposed.</p>
<p>The same goes for masks and ventilators. Forcing 50 governors to
compete for lifesaving equipment — and hospitals to pay exorbitant
prices for it — only makes matters worse.</p>
<p>Finally, we need a data-based approach to developing treatments and
a vaccine. Scientists are working full speed on both; in the
meantime, leaders can help by not stoking rumors or panic
buying. Long before the drug hydroxychloroquine was approved as an
emergency treatment for covid-19, people started hoarding it, making
it hard to find for lupus patients who need it to survive.</p>
<p>We should stick with the process that works: Run rapid trials
involving various candidates and inform the public when the results
are in. Once we have a safe and effective treatment, we’ll need to
ensure that the first doses go to the people who need them most.</p>
<p>To bring the disease to an end, we’ll need a safe and effective
vaccine. If we do everything right, we could have one in less than
18 months — about the fastest a vaccine has ever been developed. But
creating a vaccine is only half the battle. To protect Americans and
people around the world, we’ll need to manufacture billions of
doses. (Without a vaccine, developing countries are at even greater
risk than wealthy ones, because it’s even harder for them to do
physical distancing and shutdowns.)</p>
<p>We can start now by building the facilities where these vaccines
will be made. Because many of the top candidates are made using
unique equipment, we’ll have to build facilities for each of them,
knowing that some won’t get used. Private companies can’t take that
kind of risk, but the federal government can. It’s a great sign that
the administration made deals this week with at least two companies
to prepare for vaccine manufacturing. I hope more deals will follow.</p>
<p>In 2015, I urged world leaders in <a href="https://www.ted.com/talks/bill_gates_the_next_outbreak_we_re_not_ready">a TED talk</a> to prepare for a
pandemic the same way they prepare for war — by running simulations
to find the cracks in the system. As we’ve seen this year, we have a
long way to go. But I still believe that if we make the right
decisions now, informed by science, data and the experience of
medical professionals, we can save lives and get the country back to
work.

<p>With growing age, I guess one does become more experienced and
opinionated because you have been there, have done that, have been
pondering the topic at hand, maybe without a satisfying answer, but
must have witnessed how the debates went, how other opinions aroused
the crowd, how BS has hit the fans, and how time has proven some
right, while others, wrong &larr; so that you learn along the course,
if you had kept your mind open and sensitive, even a bit agitated,
sometimes angry, sometimes applauding.</p>
<p>I remember back then working in Taiyuan, I started watching TED and
started speaking to junior staffs on works by the Gates Foundation,
hoping that one day they will become a member of these initiatives and
contribute their brains to them, because these are hard, much harder,
problems than what we are solving everyday at work &mdash; imagine a
toilet without running water? I challenged them that if they thought
they are smart, try tackle this &mdash; it was a real project posted
on the Foundation's front page, maybe quite unsexy to test (how to
test it!?), but fundamentally more valuable than yet another ERP
system w/ million dollar price tag. Case in point, my friend's
volunteer site has no indoor plumbing, no indoor toilet, well, I
should say no our idea of a toilet at atll! It's a hole in the ground
in the corner of court yard with a couple planks on top where you
squat and let the gravity takes care of the rest. Fun!? Try it in
bitter winter night, or imagine your 4-year old using that without you
holding onto his body or clothes &mdash; what a fear! what a drag!</p>
<p>Yea, so for all the smart folks out there, if you consider yourself a
good engineer, making a living w/ corporate cliche is ok, but don't
let your talent only be occupied by those. Instead, keep the brain
running w/ these types of real life challenges. We living in the US
has been to spoiled to realize that all these life convenience has
been quite recent, quite uncommon, and quite engineering savvy. For
many others, it's not the cost of appliance that kept them in a stone
age mode. It's the lack of basic infrastructure such as a running
water, or electricity, or even a paved road, that make everyday
<em>business</em> a super hard, harder than you think, but once solved, it
benefits many, you don't need to market, no need to brag about its
benefits on pretty PPT, a changing life for the better, is the best
evidence and the best reward. </p></p>
