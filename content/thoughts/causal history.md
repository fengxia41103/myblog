It's a common title line of a history book or Youtube that goes
something like this, "大明亡于一只鸡", which builds a causal
relationship between _major_ event and a _trivial_ event. It's usually
quite interesting to listen to such a story, but I had a second
thought.

We all know the cliche that we are what we are because of all the
previous days, hours, minutes and seconds, no more and no less, all
combined, lump summed into this moment, so that I'm now sitting here
writing these lines and having these thoughts. Without eating the
previous 8 buns, the 9th one won't become fulfilling. A change of
anything in history would then result in a butterfly effect that it
changes the future, permanently, the unbearable lightness of being...

So, with these in mind, there must be a chain reaction leading to the
_major_ even in focus, whereas every single step, regardless how
minute and trivial at the time it took place, resulted in the final
moment when the _major_ even happened. Therefore, every single step is
**a cause**! We could argue that some steps are weightier than others,
but they are nonetheless all **causes**. Therefore, we can pick any
historical moment, and pick another one before it, and call it a
causal!

But wait a minute! Isn't this make a history, or any history analysis,
a mocking joke? And if all causal become so casual, are there any
point of building any causal relationship anymore? The bun analogy is
actually a poor one because each bun is staged as the same (amount of
food), which buns of history came in all shape and form and
ingredient. It's certainly one view to name the 8th _bun_ being the
fatal blow of a historical tragedy, but wouldn't a view of naming the
7th chicken being equally valid? or the wine the hero drank when he
was twelve!?..... This makes me wonder whether there is some clear
rules of building a causal reasoning in general or in history in
particular.

So indeed. The difference lies in the strength of your argument, not
whether you can or can not. You always can. Interesting.

But, what about science then!? Isn't it the whole point of it is to
build causal reasoning? Here is a snippet from [wiki][1]:

It is possible, theoretically. But then, who determines that `100%`!? Muddy.
