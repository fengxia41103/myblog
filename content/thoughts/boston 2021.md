Back in Boston, this time, it feels, foreign. Took Noah to all the
places I knew and enjoyed, but then, every place we went, I liked
them, and also disliked them &mdash; they are still the same, I still
like them very much, but I can't find excitement, the happiness inside
myself, anymore. Sitting on the new boardwalk looking over the canal,
the beautiful scene of the old Boston harbor, it's the million dollar
view one could only dream to have, perfect sunny day, Noah next to me,
really, what else could I be complaining about? Yet, it felt, remote,
a traveler sitting in a strange city, knowing this is just a break in
life, and nothing in your life will be changed by this moment. The
glass high rise standing on the spot where CrunchTime used to be is
magnificantly pretty. Yet, imagining living there is cool, but it
solves nothing &larr; so I guess it is this feeling of powerless that
is really bothering me this time.

Maybe it is the theme of this trip. Saw Uncle Tam. It's
tough. Powerless facing all of these &mdash; aging, illness,
dying... life has an end, and regardless how you have prepared for it,
its arrival is both intimidating and agonizing. What should I do?
