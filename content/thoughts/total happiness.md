I was thinking. If we add up the total happiness of this world, versus
all the grief, sadness, unhappiness, how would they come out to be?

I'm depressed. Noah is not doing his homework at school, and he is
moving too much in class, as usual. It pissed me off, and made me
really feeling powerless. He is refusing to grow up, but I'm getting
old, and nothing is being done. While I was feeling the blues, I start
to wonder everyone I saw roaming around the campus whether s/he has a
blue day also. I'm sure everybody has. I have long been convinced that
there is nobody's life you would be willing to swap once you learn how
messy and imperfect theirs is. Just like mine, just like yours.

So if we ever add them all up, are there more happiness than
unhappiness? On the one hand, we will all agree that happy time is
much less than unhappy time in one's life. So it seems that by sheer
number unhappiness will win. Then, when you are in love, the intensity
of that happiness is so strong that it can probably offset a lot of
unhappy days.

But then, isn't there also a theory that people are more sensitive to
loss than to gains? This would lead to the opposite conclusion that
intensity of loss, thus unhappy days, more than that of happy days?
Then, which is correct?

I don't know. Blues, depression, frustration, days without excitement
and without hope... it is certainly not fun.

I try to picture a day by the Charles, watching sunset, watching
people, watching geese flying by, watching the days go by. It's the
same 24 hours like everywhere else on this planet. It doesn't change a
thing, practically speaking. Will that really make a difference? If
so, how different? and why different?

I don't know. I guess people are yearning to a new environment,
because, like taking vacation, you walk away from a set of life as if
all the problems in that life can be ignored, made to disappear. Some of
them will, actually, since new setting makes them not applicable
anymore.

Then, there are others, will not go away. They are more patient than
we want them to be. They sit still, wait for you to come back, then
reassert themselves in front of you, may not be all at once, but
surely, persistently, stubbornly, like a trickle, they emerge silently
onto the stage, even without a word, you know, it's there.

I used to believe the total luck in one's life is a fixed number. Thus
using it up front in your younger years will leave less for later, and
vice versa. I wonder the total unhappiness in this world is a fixed
number, too. Lovers generate happiness, few, but intense. The the same
amount unhappiness is needed to counter balance them, spread out, like
air, blanket many, maybe everybody, with a tint of blue.

Like rain falling from sky, leave a few spots on everyone's
t-shirt. Instead of being water, it's ink, permanent mark, a dot,
tarnish a perfect white T, some finds it beautiful, some is
annoyed, nobody has a detergent to wash it off.

That's unhappiness, in life.
