Slug: what does it bring
Author: Feng Xia


After long thoughts, I believe I have come to the conclusion that
there are only three things that technology should bring, would bring,
and should their objectives:

1. **information repository**: everything is saved, time stamped,
   digitized, and probably even structured.
   
2. **efficiency**: this comes from the fact that data inputs are
   sanitized with definitions, rules, and assumptions &mdash; the
   manual way of doing things bury all the domain knowledge within the
   head of individual employee. Instead, implementation of a system
   extract those into a more explicit form (code written, even though
   still arcane, is better than hidden in someone's brain/instinct),
   and this create efficiency, because communication cost is lowered
   &mdash; within a system, each party uses the same set of
   vocabulary, and gradually adopting others' definitions. Conflicts
   are solve upfront in system design phase and being continuously
   negotiated so the system can function **coherently**. Therefore,
   the system forms a framework to anchor discussion and debates.
   
3. **accountability**: this is really a workflow decision. I know
   clients who are horrified to have the transparency of data, because
   then decision maker is now liable to review and penalty. Granted,
   workflow is as good as the level of commitment of
   operators. Garbage in, garbage out. And overuling with offline
   information and arbitration makes the system obsolete instantly,
   because it loses the status of **the system of record**.

If they don't fit your bill, or your customer's, technology will not
help, will not solve your problem, and you should just walk away.
