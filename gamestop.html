<p>This, is absolutely, entertaining! Wow, I have to believe that
somewhere out there there is a voice that is directing me to these
things, really. I don't watch the market usually, if at all, then,
open to read the news yesterday, and it was the frenzy of GameStop and
AMC all over the news! Of course there are plenty China readers
reaction as well. So, what to make of it!?</p>
<p>China posts usually put this as a revolution so that common people
uprising against the big capitalist, the Wall Street. Well, it's
exciting thinking that way, but it's only what the surface looks
like. I don't buy this story, well, I should say, I totally buy what
the news said about the <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/">Reddit wallstreetbets</a> where this whole
thing might have started from. But the implication, imho, is far more
than an uprising. So, this is another predict-to-the-future
episode. Let me try, maybe I do have a crystal ~~</p>
<p>First of all, learned in MBA class that stock market is pretty small
comparing to the bond market. I think it's just a commoner's fallacy
that wall street traders all watching the stock market going up and
down as we, or the 菜场大妈， do. Far from it, even though I'm just
another outside. They don't watch market as we do, and if anything,
big decisions are unlikely made on the spot by any human &mdash; there
is gotta be process, and likely automation. It's a loaded cannon, for
God's sake, that it may react quickly if a human commander can just
pull the trigger, but hey, days like yesterday's are few in a whole
year, but a loaded canon can misfire a LOT if relying on a human. So,
regardless how popular the image of these traders are in movies, I
firmly believe Wall Street lives off discipline and likely strict
automation &rarr; I'm not even talking about automation of data
crunch, backtesting, big data analysis, AI, those craps. It's codified
knowledge, strategy, experience, trial-and-error, policy, protection,
the core of what they know and what they do. Therefore, the uprising,
if we call it so, isn't really causing some panic traders running
around. Rather, it's a puzzling act, I bet, that they start to get
notifications of some strategy conditions have been met, but
unexpected, like me stepping on a bug, you know, you stare at the
screen, and all you will be saying is, "WTF", and hardly much you can
do even if you know exactly which line of code to change, because the
change has to go through a line of processes before it be stamped as
<em>production ready</em>. So, I think, is what the Wall Street, was like
yesterday.</p>
<p>Now, move on to what this episode means in the future? The easiest
answer tossed around is that revolution is here, 颤抖吧资本家. Really?
In my opinion, no. Capitalist isn't going to shake to death at
all. Again, using my bug analogy, it's definitely annoying, but not a
killer, even the BSOD isn't bad enough to scare you off your pants, is
it!? Just some terrible oversight allowed this to happen, and always
always always, a human error, not the machine's. So, we can safely
dismiss the idea that now all shorts are going to leave the arena
because, hey, who dares to counter so called <em>the people</em>!? But,
regardless how they raid, yes, raid, this is exactly like those
normads raiding some town back in the days &mdash; they brought fear,
death, and walk away w/ loots, but at the end of the day, it's hardly
a profitable model, let alone sustainable. There are many factors come
to play, which I can predict, will collapse this brotherhood high even
though it feels so good. No, this isn't some conspiracy theory, but by
my observation and thinkings of human behavior in similar settings.</p>
<p>First, there will be split of opinion on whom to loot. If not amassing
enough force, raid will not work. The first couple raids are easy to
pull off because few has too much opinion yet on a new thing &mdash;
let's try it. Once the POC is done, all of sudden, many more realize
this is a feasible path (to make $$), thus each start to chip in their
personality and opinion, which then lead down to, not business, but
politics. And to my observation, once a loosely organized community
start to battle different opinions, it will be strained because of the
high tension, and that pushes away many, thus it hurts the community
becomes large. The alternative, however, is the party, or the church,
like things, that have rules, priests, punishments, and all these
things are totally not what people joining such community wanted to
have at the first place! So they will find them propelling an org
which they themselves dislike, morally. So even making good money, the
conscience isn't as wonderful as it feels yesterday &mdash; yesterday,
it felt they did <strong>the right thing</strong>, but eventually, it becomes a
tradeoff between moral and profit, well, then how different it is then
from the Street they hate!?</p>
<p>Second, I don't like this mob actions at all. Again, it is super
entertaining. But it's scary. Not that they have a guy big enough to
blow anybody. Not yet. But they definitely have a gun that hurts. Now
the question is, are they a responsible/sane/decent guy owner!? Well,
this is a fuzzy question. Whose moral standard we go by with? And even
we could challenge, does it matter? If we consider the capitalist has
the origin of sin, then it justifies the action, right? Well, then, is
the assumption, correct? By the Trump years we can already see the
magnified mob voice everywhere, US, China, everywhere! Lies, truth,
facts, who-knows-what, are flying all over the place. Internet is a
free highway, and a lot of folks are behaving like a highway robbers,
too. So, if January we were still debating Trump's tweeter
account. Now all of sudden the Netcizens showed that other aspects of
life can be as vulnerable as the politics if applying the Internet
way. If a platform can sway voters to elect a Trump, then it is
certainly perceivable the same method can be applied to a stock, a
company, of course, a human being. If we used to consider online
bullies are just minorities of some teenager incidents, we now see the
same spirit, I should say, sentiment, is now spilling out of that
playground, and is now stretching its paws onto something we thought
pretty out of reach &mdash; well, it apparent is not, anymore.</p>
<p>Third, just saw a news that creditors of AMC just got off the hook
because now AMC can issue more stocks, raise money, then pay off these
creditors. For a losing business, creditors are betting the high
interest w/ that company not going to bankrupt. Well, now I bet they
start to realize there is another strategy &mdash; buy some online
power, get the sentiments to support his client, then bail out! Wow,
now, these people are very different from the people &mdash; they are
bankers, they have money, they have incentive, and yesterday, the
people just demo-ed a POC! Wow, I think this is the real implication
going forward. The big money is now going to come into the Internet
shouting game, hire some big mega phone, and arouse some
sentiments.</p>
<p>This, is not going to be pretty.</p>
<p>There is still one more question I don't know the answer yet &mdash; again, it's easy to perceive such strategy, but it's hard to pull it off. So, w/ all the strangers on a forum, why and how they can act in union? This, is actually quite amazing. Reminds me the news of 鹿晗 fans organized to get some exact number of blesses, something like exactly 10^8, no more, no less, on his birthday. It does then seem possible this can happen, if not sending a bless, but in yesterday's case, money.</p>
<p>Hmm... I like the name, GameStop, yeah, indeed, some old games are
being stopped, and new players and new ways are here.</p></p>
