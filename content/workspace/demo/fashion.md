Project Fashion is built to support daily business
of an international trading company who specializes
 fashion products. Main functions of the application
include
product management, customer and vendor database,
order management (both sales and purchase), and inventory management.

The company is based in US with two subsidiaries in mainland China.
The system is to replace all its offline documents so that information
that were used to be communicated via email attachments and later
through shared network drives are now centrally maintained
and shared.
