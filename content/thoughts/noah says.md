This is to keep track what Noah says these days, some smart
remarks. But first of all, let me vent what this kid is like, this
morning, that was totally pissing me off!! &mdash; so I was cleaning
his glasses the last minute before leaving for school bus. There is
this missing piece off one of the legs, looked like the plastic has
been burned off by fire. So I asked what happened to it, he replied:

1. "I chewed it off." "But why!?" "**I had this sudden desire to chew
   it.**" Said calmly and unshamefully. WTF!
   
     So here goes the first line of his I'm writing down. So him.

2. Commenting on the new badminton coach he had in class. "This guy is
   all about power." "Oh so he was a power player. That's good."  "Not
   really. **Sometimes power has to bow to wisdom.**" &mdash; very
   philosophical, isn't it!?
   
3. 8:30 pm. Out of nowhere, after his Mom left for gym, he said to me,
   "爸，我决定了，等你有了517, 我和你住" "Why?" "Because I think it
   will be difficult living with her." "Why?" "So she bought snack
   without looking at the label, and it turned out to be wasabi
   flavored, and I was the first one eating it, and I didn't have
   water then..."  hahaha!! Poor little guy!! But I asked him whether
   he has other reasons for this decision, and he said, "第二， she
   gets up late, so there is increasing chance I'll be late for
   schoolbus."  "Anything else?" "Yes. I'm actually feeling scared by
   myself at home, though everytime I said I will be ok." "You mean
   when she goes to gym and leaves you at home?" "Yes" "Then tell her
   so next time." "ok" "I leave you for gym when you come with me in
   the office also." "But that's daytime."..... "Of course. You can
   come live with me anytime. I'll get you a key... wait, I'll
   introduce you to the concierge, so she will know you, and you can
   just come whenever you want."

4. 10:00 pm. Math, struggling w/ the concept of "20% off", which he
   subtracted `$0.2`. Why so? "So how much is 20%?" "It's 20 over 100"
   "So how much will that be?" "0.2, 20 cents". Speechless, isn't it!

5. "Noah, remember to think before you ask." Pretty common
   conversation between. I don't recall what the topic
   was. Anyway. Listen to this. "爸， 我在新加坡的时候就有think." Very
   firm tone. "Really!? How?" "你记得吗？那个时候我想要touch一个bird
   poop" "我不记得了...然后呢？" "然后你说了No" "Yeah, that sounds
   right!" "但是那个时候我就有think" "How!?" this is interesting "真的
   真的！那个时候我就在think, 那个bird poop看起来是dry, 所以我就很想要
   touch它"...... speechless, isn't it!? What an example he gave to
   testify that he actually, thinks ~~

6. Noah figured out how to put his math answer back into the equation
   to verify, "哇塞，我做的这么对！！" He was genuinely surprised by
   himself, haha, what a fun to watch him grow in moment like this.

7. A beautiful early summer evening. After a long stressful day
   evacuating the contractor and his tools, having a barbecue w/ Noah
   outside the kitchen. He was talking w/ his mom about virus
   vs. bacteria. Mom was asking about "do you know which virus, and
   the only virus, cured by human so far?" (it was Hypatitis-C). Noah
   studied his science vigilantly in the week and the topic was about
   virus & bacteria, so he was confident in the discussion. However,
   he didn't have this piece. So instead he realized his gap, and said
   "Do you know what I cured?... Dad's loneliness." &larr; because in
   that afternoon, he was my companion to 517 to clean up the mess
   left by the contractor, and on the way home I said thank you to him
   for being my companion. How funny!!
   
8. On our way home from 517, I was commenting on Noah's hair and asked
   him "what is his secret". Guess what he said? He was very serious
   and also in a good mood, responded that "I will give you one
   advice, is to use woman product." "Why woman product?" "因为她们总
   是想要look good, so you must use woman product" "所以你用她们的
   product, 你也会look good" "是啊，and I use 妈的shampoo" "是吧， 但
   是那都得等很久，像什么15分钟，我没那个耐心，那你怎么办的？" "I will
   meditate" "meditate?" "yeah" "what if it's still too long?" "那我就
   put on more shampoo"... hahahaha.... this is the very first time
   Noah seriously gives me his advice, and you can tell he is really
   believing in his own discovery in this one!
