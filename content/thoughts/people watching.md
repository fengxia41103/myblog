Traveling is indeed relaxing. I think I know why &rarr; first of all,
you don't have the daily chore to deal with, no daily routine, no
daily worries, no family, no kids, no work. Second, in a new place, it
always spells opportunity, unknown, as if everything is now possible
&rarr; new encounter, new face, new soul mate just around the corner.
People don't know you, you don't know them. Somehow, they all look,
nice, kind, smiling at you. Especially when you are in a new country,
new language feels so exotic, you don't know what they are saying, but
they all sound really, cute, don't they!

Then, there is, people watching. How fascinating! The thing I like to
do the most on a trip is, people watching. Just like now, sitting by a
bay this beautiful window by a sidewalk in Seoul, snowing a bit this
morning that streets are covered by a layer of snow dusts, then,
watching office people walking by to their destination, all dressed
up, all look serious, all still in their daily route &larr; somehow,
you feel, superior, that you are looking at them as if God is looking
at our earthings, how much pity he has for us then?

The other day while walking pointlessly in Seoul, I ran into this
nice 3-story Starbucks sitting in the middle of a triangle
square. Went up the 3rd floor for a coffee break, perfect location to
watch people in and out the fancy glass buildings surrounding all
around. What do they do? what is their life like? do they have a love?
and are they happy? are they married? or about to get married? are
they dating? or in the middle of divorce? ..... oh, this massive loaf
of cinnamon bread I ordered this morning!!!... too much food!!... even
though it is really really good!!!... you know, life can't be better
than this &mdash; sitting by a warm AC, next to a big winder, no one
else but a low hum of air conditioner, flashing xmas tree and light,
holiday is in the air, cold outside, a BIG mug of hot coffee, no
agenda, no plan, just to kill time, to feel life, as it can be &mdash;
life, is indeed, a beautiful thing. I had moments when I felt life was
hopeless, not worth living anymore. Then, as of this moment, I think I
would regret if I am about to die. There is a side of life that is
vain, ugly, disgusting, harsh, unpleasant. Then, there is this side,
peaceful, quiet, everything falls into its place, no rush, you can
slow down, you can sit here in the morning, typing things on your
mind, thinking about the person you want to think of, how far apart
you have grown, where she is, what she is doing, how well she is
today, does she also have a moment like this today, a cup of coffee
for breakfast, and how much you wished she would be here, sitting
across this table, having a conversation, even to talk about the daily
headache you two have to solve today, it's ok, just be here, be
here. How I wish you were, here!

This is such an unexpected trip. Without connecting w/ Seokhwan for
years, all of sudden he popped up in the map, and I decided when and
then that I'm coming to see him, to see his city, his country, and to
give myself a break. I don't know what to expect, and honestly, I
don't really care. Just go somewhere, and have an alone time, is
good. But what a wonderful place this is!!! I constantly think of the
word, 苦寒之地, which must have been in the old days. But then, I have
to say, their king back then picked a GREAT spot to set up this city,
and the city has become really a nice looking place.

So are their people, good looking &mdash; boys, girls, men, women,
they all walk in style, though not yet as exquisite as the Japanese,
but quite close. Girls all have perfect makeups on (well I guess they
are perfect, cause I couldn't tell the difference otherwise), and have
**really beautiful hair**. They are not all stars, but they take good
care of themselves, and that matters. Girls, women, really, should be
just responsible to be beautiful, to make this society look nice, to
make human life feel, nice. Let men do all the hard work, but enjoy a
scene of beautiful sight, wherever you turn, you feel the sense of
beauty, the sense of what life can produce, can make, can
give. Wouldn't that be a rare gift already! I know there will be
feminists who say that women are more than their body, their look, but
also they have brains. Totally agree, but they underestimate how hard
it is to become elegant, to act elegant, to be a perpetual beauty, not
just when you are young and beautiful by nature, but be that way when
you grow, when you age, when you mature &larr; honestly, I think it
takes not only hard work, but wisdom &rarr; Excel, Powerpoint, MBA,
any of these, you can learn from book and school, but being an elegant
person in life, to have the inner touch that reflects to the outside
world, to warm up the person near you, to _lift hearts_ that are down,
that, takes talents, takes courage, takes a wonderful mind, to achieve
that.

Noah really liked the movie [Wonder][1]. It was an ok story, too easy
for me to predict its line and its ending. Yet, the climax when he was
awarded his school's yearly achievement, was nice, when the principal
said "whose strength carries up the most hearts by the attraction of
his own". Yes, if only she knows, if only I could keep telling her
this &mdash; you have a heart of gold, you have such a kindness and
inner beauty. Not only you are pretty, but you have brought warmth to
everyone around you, that is, wonder, that is why I miss you so much,
and I care about you so much. I wish the coldness of this world will
never get to you, will never let you down. I wished that I would be
there to shield you from all the bad things that can come your way,
but I'm weak and old, and I wouldn't be able to accompany you long
before you would have to face these yourself. For that, I think the
best is to let you go, so you can find someone near your age, so that
he could be there for you, to grow old with you, to protect you the
longest possible time. I don't know whether you understand this. I
think someday you will, if you happen to read this, somehow. As smart
as you are, I know you would.

So my dear sunshine, my 遥远的美丽的人, at this 苦寒之地, I am missing
you. How much you would have loved this snow! I can see your face
brighten up, reaching out to hold a snow flake, as if you were a kid
again. Yes, so this is a perfect day for this trip, snow, snow,,
millions of them coming down, remind me Boston, a place I miss, and
you, a person I miss.

早安.

PS. Just realized, this coffee shop is called _I'm Home_. Life indeed
has a strange plan for me.
