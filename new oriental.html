<p>The fiasco of Didi has not yet got me off the hook, now there is the
EDU, the New Oriental that was the crown jewel of english tutoring
service 20+ years back when I was still young and battling
TOEFL/GRE. Some wall street hedge fund guy said DIDI was a political
terrorism by the Chinese government against US investors.... now I
think the decision of k12 education is even worse than that &mdash;
it's a terrorism on people's brain, in particular, on kids whose
future is yet to be unfolded, but now shut.</p>
<p>This reminds the Christianity before the reformation, that yes there
is God, but guess what, you can't get hold of a bible (because it's
sacred and rare and expansive, a book was expansive in general), and
you can't talk to Him directly except through priest, and his message
is only known to you layman through the mouth of our priests, by their
interpretation... what changed this was the printing technology. Now
book becomes cheaper, layman can now afford a copy, of course, the
more forbidden it is, the better price it can fetch for the seller, so
now there are more copies in people's hands, and led to more
opinion/interpretation of the <em>idea</em>, which then caused individual to
think why I have to speak to Him through a middleman, and btw, that
middleman hasn't been correct, nor consistent, nor even honest by many
measures, so was the reformation...In other words, I'm wondering, if
we are to kill K12, what's the basis to support it? Reformation was
founded on printing, what will this move be founded upon? I think it
has to be technology, also. Ideology is just, talk. In order to
achieve anything physically different, the mindware itself isn't
enough, it has to marry with something real, something fundamental in
people's daily life, in order to has its effect.</p>
<p>So, technology. Here is a paper published by some US researchers on
<a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2106.02167">the GFW</a>, quite entertaining to read actually, because again, it's
an example how ridiculously crude the implementation is as a trademark
of the craftsmanship of so called engineering work over there. This
reminds me the BS back in the 90s when some company received this
tremendous amount of fund by the government, developed an <em>anti-virus</em>
software which blacklisted also porn sites and others, but its data
files were locally stored (grantedly the Internet was not yet as it is
today), and were deciphered within a day by Carnegie Mellon, and
results published (as study paper if I recall), and the blacklist
became a comprehensive yellow page to all the porn sites which I
didn't know, but now know :) hahaha.... not only because Carnegie is
good, but the company only used the common zip to zip its data file,
and didn't have any particular tech edge in the space of so called
security, implementation was probably good enough to fool a
computer-illiterate, but to ppl like Carnegie or myself, the clue is
as obvious as daylight. So it's the same in many of the projects I got
involved since, and so is this GFW paper reveals &mdash; for god sake,
how stupid could it be to create a regex that miss fires on any DNS
contains "99"!.. I mean, come on, where is your test data set? Have
you ever measured your false positive rate and false negative
rate?...oh well.</p>
<p>Priest is nothing but a channel of knowledge, knowledge as the
product, and ppl as the consumer. Therefore, any control is only to
decide which of the three parts one want, or can, control. Apparently,
producers are not doable these days anymore. Back in the days, there
was only one copy of the Bible (presumably only one copy as the real
one, though I'm sure many different versions were in circulation),
like there is only brand of car you can buy, the "you can have any
color you want as long as it is black". But now, many of the producers
are outside its control, abroad for example, and many <em>consumers</em> are
also producers (as everyone is publishing all kinds of ideas/opinions
all the time). Therefore, it is not possible to control that end.</p>
<p>What about the receiving end? Well, in the way that is exactly what
has been, by telling you what you should like/dislike, what you buy,
and so on, brainwash, propaganda, whatever the name is called, the
whole point is to construct a Truman's world, that you would be made
to believe the sky is actually pink, if I so decide. However, this
becomes a sheer number game &mdash; with that many brains walking
around, it's hard to identify outlier, and it's hard to prevent new
outliers, either. Even with them being the minority, it's concerning
because the system is based on uniformity, like a dam, can't afford
the slightest crack.</p>
<p>This leaves to the only option, which is the channel. Now this becomes
a pure business case &mdash; five force. Who are your competitors? Who
are your alternatives? ... then, of course, the ideal setup is,
monopoly. By being the only player in the field, a business gains the
most power over consumer and vendor, and maximizes its profits while
sacrificing both ends. Of course it has been universally proven to be
a bad idea because it is super wasteful. But, if nothing stops you,
any business naturally grows towards monopoly, so will be a
government, and I believe this is happening.</p>
<p>So K12 is just yet another step in the direction of monopoly. This
time, the vendor is the knowledge and ideas, and the consumers are,
k12. If human mind has infinite capacity and possibility to create
something good and wonderful as if a lightening has struck, then it
is equally elasticity to be compressed, depressed, distorted, without
showing much sign of damage... I don't know what this is going to
be. But I firmly believe, a damage is a damage, like a bug, you pay
the price sooner or later, if you are aware of it but not to fix it.</p></p>
