# solution

[code][2].

- **problem space**: < 20!
- **test criteria**: divisible by all numbers between 1-20 without
  redundancy, eg. `%4==0 includes %2==0`.

## method 1

Don't know what I was thinking. Definitely an example of overthinking
and over engineering.

```python

import itertools


def method_1(target):
    """Method 1 is a bit over complex.  We are to turn all target values
    into a list of prime factors.  Then we compare each factor list to
    compute how many 2s, 3s.. and so on each list represents. We then
    take the max count of 2s, 3s... and so on to form a master list.
    This master list will be able to derive all target values.
    """
    results = {}

    # find prime factors
    for i in range(1, target):
        factors = []

        j = 2
        while j * j <= i:
            while i % j == 0 and i > j:
                i = i / j
                factors.append(j)
            j += 1

        factors.append(i)
        for key, g in itertools.groupby(factors):
            if key in results:
                results[key] = max(len(list(g)), results[key])
            else:
                results[key] = len(list(g))

    multiple = []
    for key, count in results.iteritems():
        multiple += [key] * count

    print reduce(lambda x, y: x * y, multiple)
```

## method 2

Much better. Build a minimum factor list of a given target.

```python
def method_2(target):
    """Method 2 uses a base factor list
    to iterate. The idea is to divide target as much
    as possible using all factors on the list. If there is
    still a remainder, add that to factor list. This way,
    we are searching the minimum factor list that represents
    a target value.
    """
    factors = [2, ]
    for i in range(1, target):
        for f in factors:
            if i % f == 0:
                i = i / f
        factors.append(i)
    print reduce(lambda x, y: x * y, factors)
```
