I was thinking. People get anxious on topic like bitcoin, why? Some
talk says because the feeling of "loss" is greater than the feeling of
"gain" even though the amount is the same. This has been proven in
stock books. But then, things like bitcoin, or success, is **NOT** a
loss &larr; you can only lose something if you had it already. 

As you can see, many many many times, marketing or hooligans will
present this thing in a light of "them being finite" &mdash; there are
only these many ocean view spots you can ever build a house for; there
is only these many bitcoins determined by its algorithm (and do we
have a math book on this algorithm!? and how much have we proven, on
paper, that its set is finite!? I mean, how do I know this statement
is true!?), and even life itself &mdash; you can live once, so
maximize it (by doing ______ ). How familiar! but also how strange!
Why is this effective!? Why do you get anxious when the resource is
presented as being **finite**? and if you take a step back, tell me
one thing that is not finite!? Few, if not none! Then why bother!?
Everything is finite, so why is this one any different? But reality
is, that we get anxious by it &mdash; missing a love, missing a good
job, missing a friend gathering, missing a lottery ticket, or simply,
scared of getting old (life is a process of counting down,
continuously, stubbornly, irreversibly, and sadly &larr; sad because
I'm anxious!)... so why!?

A missing opportunity?  This feels like peer pressure. Everyone is
getting on this wagon, I can't be left behind. Last time when I was at
Reader's Corner, two old guys were chatting with clerk about
aging. One guy said, "you know you are getting old when your doctors
are becoming younger than you". Clerk said, "I knew a woman who lived
into her 100s. You know what is good about being that old?... she
said, no peer pressure".. hahaha. So true. So come back to the
topic. The missing opportunity only comes into play if you consider
that you can, or stand a chance, of benefiting from that opportunity;
otherwise, I don't think it matters.

But why do you think you stand a chance? One an age old confession is
that human are **over**-optimistic when evaluating risks. There are
many rational, for example, that's how human race has survived in the
wild, so it's part of our built-ins. But this doesn't explain it.

Then, alternatively, there is opportunistic, which is just "exploiting
chances offered by immediate circumstances without reference to a
general plan or moral principle." But what's wrong of being
opportunist? I don't know the difference. Isn't opportunity a good
word? When so called an opportunity presents itself in front of you,
how do you determine whether this is an opportunity? and how would you
know whether taking it will jeopardize your integrity? If turn out
your integrity or moral was comprised, well, you were an opportunist;
if not, were you then an entrepreneur?

But don't these also lead the same thing I have discussed over and
over, that these are just words, invented by someone or some
culture/country to describe a thing/feeling. Now writing this I feel
the word should only be frozen in that moment when it was first
appearing, because then we have no way to reconstruct the context in
which it was invented, therefore any subsequent use of it is literally
a risk of tagging something that is similar (maybe), but can also be
the negation (also valid) &larr; how do you know!? &rarr; this becomes
a chicken-egg race, 

1. you can't determine whether this is thesame-as/similar-to the
   original circumstance when this word was valid/invented because you
   don't understand the current situation yet;
2. but in order to understand current, you have to use these words to
   **describe** (to your brain, really);
3. but by using these words to describe, you have already committed
   their meaning/implication, and will be limited by their
   limitation. Therefore, you will not be able to jail-break so to
   understand the current situation as they are &larr; it's like
   looking through a tinted glass &rarr; everything will be blue-ish,
   if your glass is blue.
   
Very strange a world we are living in, indeed! Human invented language
in order to communicate ideas. But then ideas are expressed by
language which themselves **tinted** the ideas so ideas are now
becoming ambiguous, subject to interpretatoin, and abusive even.

But cutting off all language, thus communication, will result in what?
silence of the world? or death of the human race? or a idea-less
crowd!? None sounds appealing. In this sense, English, being adopted
by 70% of the world population (especially by the billion Chinese), is
totally doing human a favor &mdash; then, everyone is also confined by
English way of thinking, judgement, rational, and this mental
dominance. I think this must be the theoretical foundation behind
propaganda, that enforcing ppl to use **your language** is **THE way to
shape their logic, and to shape their mind** &rarr; 

> "Now take this blue
> glass and put it on. Didn't I tell you that this world is actually
> blue!?" "OMG! You are sooooo right!"
> 

Magic. Isn't it!?

So when you get anxious over something next time, look for a
different language to use, and I can guarantee this anxiety will go
away. Reality didn't change; resource is still finite (as always, and
will always be); anxiety, is just an English word trying to describe
your feeling; and your feeling, can be called "happiness" in Mars's
term, and they have a lot of books in Mars to teach you that,
"Happiness, is all you should care."

Ha, ha, ha.
