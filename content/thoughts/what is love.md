What is it? I have written so much about this word, and have been
thinking so hard about what it is, but not until a few days ago, in
the evening, by the sunset, watching geese and ducks going home, w/ a
mountains far far away, no sound but the sound of ordinary country
life, when the old guy next door walking to his old lady, pulled out
his hand w/ some sunflower seeds, she reached out, w/ a big smile,
took them, and they stood side by side, just like, w/ all the wrinkles
testifying their identity and their tough life. Yet, they smiled, they
chatted, they were next to each other, in an arm's length, everyday,
every evening &mdash; to them, this is not love, it's life itself
&mdash; you don't label it w/ such exotic word, you simply live it.

I asked the lady what she calls her Mr., "阿哥（gu er）", she smiled,
a bigger smile, on her face, when she was saying the words, 阿哥, so
sweet, so, sweet. "What does he call you?" I was expecting 阿妹. She
smiled again, a shy smile, at age 72, can't you be sweeter than,
this!? "He doesn't call me anything. He calls me by name... we call
each other by names", so she said. 

But here he was, pulling out a small gift he probably just picked up
from somewhere, or just found from his pocket, he gives them to her,
as if it were a given, and that, is what love is &mdash; it's plain,
warm, and touching.
