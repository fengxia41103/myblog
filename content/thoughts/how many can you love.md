Train is an interesting, amazing thing. Never thought I will be
sitting on a train (CalTrain) which brought me a feeling of riding
train in China.

I haven't expected to see your messages, because I think it is the
right thing to do that I should disappear from your life
entirely. Watching a movie the other night, a line struck me &mdash; a
woman said she hates a man, that she is now 39, and have not
married. I don't want you to be like that. I want you to move on your
life, because you have so much ahead of you. Don't waste time with
me. Don't. Everyone has a life to live, live yours, experience
yours. I feel like a parent who is watching over his child, knowing
all too well what is ahead of him, yet have to refrain from directing
his life &mdash; if it were a fall, I could only be there when he
falls, and pull him out if I am able to. So that's how I feel,
watching the Californian sun zooming by my window. Out there, it is a
crowded town with homes, cars, trees, grasses, mountain at remote
background. But they are just passing by; you, stayed.

Walking on the street the other night, I was thinking to myself, just
how many women I have fallen in love with in my life? Surprisingly,
there have been quite a few. So what does it mean? Does it mean that
human, or male, is capable of (or rather, instintly will) loving
_quite a few? Each episode was real. I tried to think which one is the
one I _love the most_, the one who left a dent on my soul, whereas
others who have been loved, but moved on? Sometime I picture lying in
death bed, which one of them I would want to see the most, the one
whom I want to know she is doing well, will be ok, and regretfully I
now have to leave first?

Each breakup was a tough one. They all felt the end of the world. I
know some have now faded in memory whose name and smile hardly pass
through my mind anymore. Then there are one and two, whose voice and
figure linger on, peeked from deep inside as often as they have always
been, fresh, close, vivid, real.

So, how many can one love in a life? many, perhaps. Then there is one,
whose shadow takes over all of them. Is she the true love? or just a
wound never closed? or, perhaps, as perfect as a love, can be?
