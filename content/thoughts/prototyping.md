Summary: Building a prototype is a must-have for any new project
    and new business idea. It is not only a way to test out
    the initial thoughts so we know it is feasible, it also builds a
    common platform for client and developers to communicate while they
    are looking at the same thing.

I believe in the power of prototypes.
That is to say, I want to see an idea in action before
I feel comfortable of its existence and the soundness
its being. A few years back
when I first
started a career as engineer, I learned a valuable lesson.
After making modifications based on a requirement and checked
code into SourceSafe (a Microsoft source control product), I
thought all was well, until a senior team member called on me.
Part of his job was to mentor and supervise my work.
He asked to review
the change. So we sat down side by side. I showed him
and he said it was a good job. Then he said,"Not
that I don't trust you. It's just my thing that I need to see
things with my own eyes in order to believe."

Fast forward to now, after 20 years doing software development
and project management, I am leaning more and more towards
this "seeing things with my own eyes" mentality. Maybe it is
an age thing. But considering the complexity of a
software application these days and the precision it requires,
being conservative is a good trait.

Prototype, or proof-of-concept (POC), is a wonderful
thing. In my opinion it serves four important functions:

1. <span class="myhighlight">It proves the concept</span>.
Nothing is more valuable than knowing
the path in mind is not a dead end. This applies in particular to
those projects that have large share of uncertainties. Taking
a trip to Mars is not mind-boggling if you know your friend
John has just traveled there and back. But if you were the first
one sent to Mars, oh boy.

2. <span class="myhighlight">It formulates a design</span>.
Over the process of building a prototype, key
components will be researched, evaluated, adopted,
developed, integrated and tested. System boundaries will emerge. Key
functions and services will be grouped into at least three tiers:
low-hanging fruits, hard but do-ables, and dont-know-hows.
This knowledge, in turn,  will drive task
priorities, task estimation, and risk evaluation.
All these will become a cornerstone of the system design so it will be
practical, executable, and working.


3. <span class="myhighlight">It builds communication</span>.
Building prototypes involves lots of
discussions. Clients brain dumps their expectations to dev team, while
dev team internalizes those business functions into
a coherent picture illustrated using their familiar technology jargon.
Details that hold importance but have been neglected will be discovered
and ironed out. A common knowledge base
and a common vocabulary will be built over the course. Instead of
business syntax on one side (requirements)
while some technology jargon on
the other (SQL? Queue?), we now have a vocabulary that all
could understand, contribute, and use to effectively communicate.
This reminds me a strategy by Starbucks. Their staff will repeat
a customer's order in a particular sequence:

    1. Hot or iced.
    2. Size.
    3. Decaf.
    4. Number of shots (if any extra)
    5. Number of pumps of syrup (if you're that specific)
    6. Type of milk.
    7. Any extras (mo' whip, mo' deliciousness)
    8. Drink type (latte, Frappuccino, etc.)


    Why do they do that? To build a common a vocabulary and
    to improve communication. The result, less error and happier customer.

4. <span class="myhighlight">It removes risks</span>. Hiccups will be discovered early
on in the game; workarounds will be put in place; strategies
will be clarified; team knowledge will be shared; and collaboration
will be formed and adapted. Let's put it this way: if a POC
did not work out, whether it be because of technical challenge
or organizational barrier, the full-blown project is not gonna succeed.

So next time you have an exciting idea that will dominate the world,
take that drawing on napkin to build a prototype, because as the old saying,
seeing is believing.
