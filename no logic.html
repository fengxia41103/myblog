<p>Long time no see.</p>
<p>The escalating violence happening in the piece of land is prompting me
to write something. Also, a very tiring week, somehow, even though
work went well, made a presentation of Gen AI to the CIO crowd and all
the <em>captains</em> on the ship, and I suppose it was received well, thus
it's really a good start of my day in this org. But towards the end of
Friday, I felt my entire system was slowing down, and I was even too
tired to play the phone. Maybe it's just a relaxing time after a
highly focused session, like a running train on sprint, that needs a
break to rest.</p>
<p>So this morning, all I want to do is to sit in OpenEye and dump brain,
on the events that is happening, that, from any way I could think of,
is a rare black-and-white one, thus should have had a pretty
straightforward expectation of people's reaction. Yet, reading replies
on Zhihu yesterday totally made me wonder, how my such maybe naive
view of human being, or to be more specific, of the subset of human
being living on that land, governed by that team, could be so off!?</p>
<p>It is no secret that the so called <strong>-ism</strong> is living on fostering
nothing but hatred, that it feeds off a sentiment of humiliation
&rarr; agony &rarr; revenge. The script they have in mind is
essentially of a slave turning to a master. Not that this is
incorrect, as many Hollywood movies of motivating kind speak of the
same line. But somehow, these <strong>-ism</strong> ones are, different! What is
it? It's like a code smell, it's more of a feel, by experience, that
it is not a good idea, and in this case, it's rather a bad one. I like
a recent word, 解构, that to analyze and destruct a complex (and many
times the complexity is just seemingly so) concept into a digestable
structure/framework/components so that one gets to comprehend, in my
engineering term, what is under the hood (while typing the word
"hood", just reminded me the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Little_Red_Riding_Hood">little red riding
hood</a>, in which
what is under the hood!? a wolf!!!). And not surprisingly, well, I
should actually say, surprisingly, when you start 解构, very likely
you ended up finding a wolf under the hood, and it's exactly the case
in today's China, a wolf.</p>
<p>Its wolf warrior diplomats have been roaming around the world stage,
howling and hissing for a while now. Funded by the fostered hatred
over the ages of prosperity, which, by a common sense, should have
been cultivated the population towards an urge to improve, to be
learned, to be empathetic, to be intelligent of telling good vs. bad,
right vs. wrong, to be yearning for more of the goods which they have
just felt the benefits, to be wanting in company of those who have the
attributes, to be disgusted by those who weighs behinds... yet,
surprise! Here is this 14B people, enjoying all the benefits of the
human civilization and inguity, turned against the root of all these
exact same benefits &mdash; that of collaboration, learning from each
other, being grateful for the giants when we stand on their shoulders,
and being humble w/ our own limitation, ignorance, likelyhood of being
in fault, and tolerance of difference. This is a pure <strong>ironic</strong>!</p>
<p>And this is getting me very much curious. How could one, already
been through the disaster of the exact behavior or idea that it will
bring, thus knowing all too well what is at the other end of the
tunnel, yet choose just again of the same wine given that it is a new
bottle this time. Isn't this, stupid, or what!? I can't even be sure
that the word <em>stupidity</em> is a proper word to describe this. This is
nearly a pure insantity!  This is literally the definition of one
whose mind has gong insane, that the common sense and common logic
don't apply anymore, that one is seeking out for harm as if they were
pleasure. Back in time religious believers did the same thing to themselves, backed
by their, belief. Now fast forward 1000 years, I'm witnessing the same
effect, but not sure what belief that is!? Or, if it were a belief,
then I really don't think it's a good one. I hold that myself has no
position to judge anyone's belief, whatever it may be, but at the mean
time, myself is entitled to hold my own belief/judgement, also, and I
think what they are <em>believing</em> is a complete nonsense!</p>
<p>Killing a 10-year old boy, a random kid on the street, is a
crime. Period. There isn't much in life that is black &amp; white, and
this one, is. Period. Forget about wiggling out of this one. Even if
the person is medically insane, what was done was,
<strong>wrong</strong>. Reasoning this that root of the crime is a historical
grudge (and btw, not even a personal one, but a broad stoke of a
nation-2-nation, race-2-race) is a complete nonsense because, the act
of reasoning must build a logic chain of <strong>causal</strong>
relationships, and being <strong>causal</strong> is not an easy task! Of course you
<em>can claim anything "causal"</em> in your coffee chat, that of a butterfly
effect, that of 子非鱼 焉知鱼之乐 kind of defense. But, that's just
the fun of it. If you do indeed take such defense seriously, you are
already done &mdash; because such line is nothing but a 话术, or my
word, arguing for arguing's sake &larr; <strong>This is not reasoning. This
is a statement &mdash; that you just want to win.</strong></p>
<p>Therefore, what they are doing is dressing up the true intention of
winning under a hood of reasoning &rarr; they want to appear they are,
"reasonable", but they themselve have no idea of reasoning, no
intention to reason, and no sense of such contradict. Like a cave man,
or the babies, insensitive to pain, not because they are strong, but
because they are too dumb to understand. And this, is what is
happening. Incredible, isn't it? That with all the modern technology
in everyone's life, all the knowledge and info you could easy get w/
your phone, which, again ironically, everyone there is holding on and
cheering about as their life line, someone could be in such a mental
state. I don't get it.</p>
<p>There have been fables, stories, proverbs, all of these, that roll off
everyone's tongue as if they are the wisdom, the smart lines. And yet,
if only one is willing to pause, and look at what oneself has just
said, just done, just applauded for, one will be shocked, that what
you just jeered at 2 seconds ago, are being done by yourself right
now! The response of 为什么说对不起 when you were not the killer, is a
great example of this &mdash; the same rational goes years back that不
是你撞的为什么要扶, which essentially derives to 事不关己高高挂起.
Well, great! If the replier, you, does indeed stand by this, then pls
put your finger prints here, because then I will continue the logical
reasoning to show where this line will lead you to. <strong>Do you dare!?</strong></p>
<p>Let's start where, actually anywhere will do. Once this is your life
belief, the none-of-my-biz logic above, any harm bestowed on you will
lose any ground for you to complain, because the bestowers are
strangers to you, and by following your line, they feel no shame, no
guilt, no remorse, and <strong>no need</strong>. You got cut off in traffic? too
bad. You want to return sth w/ a receipt? no way.... cause as soon as
everyone is for him/her-self mode is turned on, this so called
<em>society</em> is done! There is not group, no association, no community,
no bond, no trust, no reliance, anymore. This is not the
personal-freedom mode you may mistakenly think of &larr; this is the
jungle mode 1.0, even before wolfs hunt packs &rarr; this is the time
when wolf will eat wolf. <strong>Do you still dare!?</strong></p>
<p>I can be sure they don't have the brain capacity to derive this
far. Thus everything I just painted is nothing but a <em>huh</em> to
them. However, that's the one and only thing that human shines above
all other living being on this planet so far, that of the power of
reasoning so that you could <em>guess</em> what it can be, that there is a
wall on this path, without having to run into the wall first! Now they
are just giving this all up, the only worthy trait a human has as a life
form has!</p>
<p>I guess this is the case in point of 被仇恨蒙蔽双眼. I don't know who
is the God of Hatred. Whoever that is will be pretty happy right now,
cause, by the latest count of 8.2B people on earth, 17.07% of them are
your followers. I don't know where there is also grade of smart
vs. dumb in the world of hatred, I would guess there must be, it's the
universal law, that within any group/team, 20% are the ones who carry
80% of the load, the remains are just 猪队友, dead weight, that drags
the team down. Well, there you go, mr. God, not sure the quality of
your teammates here, and for the 20% elites, <strong>good luck</strong>, cause a
combination of <strong>hate+stupidity</strong> is a pretty sure recipe for
something unpleasant, and being close to them is, in my common sense,
or should I say in my sincere suggestion, not a good idea.</p></p>
