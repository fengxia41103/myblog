Setting up [Heat][1] with [Openstack Devstack][2] is straightforward
once user realizes that the official [instructions][3] is not
up to date. In the doc there are two ways to enable Heat service:

1. Enable as a service:

        [[local|localrc]]

        # Enable heat services
        enable_service h-eng h-api h-api-cfn h-api-cw
    
2. Enable as a plugin:
    
        [[local|localrc]]

        #Enable heat plugin
        enable_plugin heat https://git.openstack.org/openstack/heat

The gotcha is that **do not use both**! As a matter of fact, for newer
devstack, the only method that works is the plugin.

Devstack takes a long time to stand up. As a newbie, once you have
created a stack, you also need to issue the following commands in
devstack VM in order to enable SSH to your new VMs:

```shell
openstack security group rule create --proto icmp --dst-port 0 default
openstack security group rule create --proto tcp --dst-port 22 default
```

Again, not that [official document][4] didn't tell you. It's just
buried deep and hard to find.
