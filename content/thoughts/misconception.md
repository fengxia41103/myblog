I'm in a constant amazement how misconcepted this world is, by me, and
by many many others. Not only of this world as it is now, but the so
called history, things that have happened, have passed, should have
been written in stone, crystal clear, no ambiguity. Yet, when reading
a book like [this one][1], it's truly an eye opener that what I
thought I have known, what everybody thinks they have known, were not
so, were, perhaps, forgotten, or, were not understood in the first
place.

Sometimes I feel the history is playing a funny game, that by a common
sense, the longer you wait, usually the more faded the memory becomes,
thus the more likely what was remember became less and less _accurate_
or _reliable_, like what I have argued against in [this article][2]
that many of the Chinese elites are propogating the _main stream_ idea
of China's history with much distortion, which are obviously
**illogical** because they failed in cross checks. But they were
_invented_ anyway so to fit for the needs of the uprising nationalism
sentiment and of course, the needs of the ruling authority at all
levels, whatever the level may be, and whatever the ruler's taste and
preference may be. As the proverb says, 上有所好, there must then be
providers to satisfy it.

But on the other hand, there is another _convention_ that the longer
you wait before looking back, the clearer you will start to see what
was truly the case, because the effect of the even had been known, had
played out, and it's much easier (in theory) to formulate a causal
argument which is both convincing and closer to the truth, even though
I also constantly have the doubt that causal relationship is but
another human invention to assist our perception, and there are, have
been, and always will be, many many casual relationships that can be
formed out of any two events, historical events in particular, because
they can not be tested again, thus are nothing but interpretations,
your words against mine, that kind of deal. Nonetheless, the more
stepped back you are from the event, the more likely you are less
partial about one way or the other, thus giving you a better chance to
be neutral and objective, cool-headed, to cut through the mess and see
the core. But doing so also requires not only knowledge and judgement,
but practice, then, how would one gain practice without first making a
lot of such mistakes? This ask itself is illogical, isn't it? What a
catch 22!

I never read the [The Grapes of Wrath][3], and didn't know [John
Steinbeck][4]. But this [book][1] is fascinating. I wish I could type
it down because there are so many points I couldn't agree more. More
importantly, the process that America has emerged, how people have
treated _newcomers_, are the exact same pattern being played out in
China, in a new community, in a team in a company, over and over and
over, thus making me to believe that this pattern is not only common,
but is speaking loud how human groups behave, predictably,
unchanged. Actually everytime I came across a book like this, I can't
help having an urge to go back to school and take on social studies
&mdash; though I am disgusted by human's behavior I witness everyday,
especially during the morning rush hours on the road, I think social
study as a way to research and observe human and human group, is the
much harder task to undertake than an engineering challenge &larr; I
can learn many many of the hard science and math, but I can't get even
a slim grip on human's emotion, desire, reaction, thinking. It's
either that I'm just bad at it, or, they are just too damn hard!

Anyway. Let me type down the first misconception of America, that
people have come to this land to form a paradise on earth with
everybody being a sisterhood or brotherhood, such a friendly place,
friendly people, wonder idea &mdash; wrong, wrong, wrong. And I'm
hoping that by reading this, you will start to question everything you
think you have come to see and hear, and wonder, whether they have
become a misconception:

> the poor dirt farmers of Oklahoma and pushed them westward, they were
> met with perhaps even more suspicion and resentment than the other waves.
