Walking on the street in SH, I just realized what is wrong with this
place. So I was walking across this giant intersection, and I do mean
**giant** because everytime I had to put in the high gear and used my
dash speed at the first moment the walking sign turned green in order
to **barely** make to the other side, provides there were not many
cars making their right turn and cut me off in the middle of the
intersection. Let's put this way, to walk across these modern looking
six-lane intersection is a matter of courage, full mindness of being
ready to die, or fight, and a secret pray that the drivers will let
you pass, or the guy next to you will block the hit for you.

This doesn't sound good. So SH puts out an army of __social workers__ on
the street to manage these intersections. They can be spotted with
uniform and often a flag in hand. I was just starting the dash when
the uniform turned to me and clearly warned me to use the zebra
line. The zebra line is a good 20 steps away from where I was, and
with the cutting throat of count down I have with the walking sign,
that's a lot to afford. Well, well, being a good citizen of nobody, I
moved towards the zebra line.

Then all of sudden, it came to me. That's it! This is what is wrong
with zebra line. Everbody knows the line is meant to protect the
pedestrians. But watch, the cars turning to this direction were making
the right without slowing down a bit!  A few approached cautiously
were not gonna stop either. They were reluctantly brought to a halt
because a few brave souls in front of me walked on with a spirit of
"you stop or dare you I have a gun". So if the cars were not observing pedestrians on
the zebra line, what's the point of asking us to use it, and take it
one step further, what is the point of having the line at all!? To me,
it felt almost like aggregating all the dispersed pedestrians onto the
lines so the drivers have an easy time to aim and fire in batch mode.
Or maybe the line provides camouflage of some sort that does make me
invisible, or invincible, or maybe a special power to battle the
upcoming steel. Well well, that's quite an imaginative wish, isn't it?

<span class="myhighlight">Zebra line is really a form a social
contract </span>. Like any other contract, both parties enter the deal
must hold their ends in order for the contract to work. If any drops
the ball, the other one will have no incentive to (and should not)
observe the contract anymore, and that's exactly what is going on with
these zebra lines. What's the point of asking me to step on the zebra
line when nothing is stopping those cars?

Instead, let's cancel the turn-right signal while there is a walking
sign on. No more opportunist. When I walk, all cars that can cut in
the zebra lines get red light, period. Until drivers learn to give
pedestrians a safety zone, they pay the price in form of longer wait for their
ignorance and arrogance. Oh, and please make the walk timer longer. If
the city is troubled by ever growing number of cars which made these
**giant** intersections necessary, pedestrians should be encouraged,
not defeated.

Is this why we don't have Beatles in China?
