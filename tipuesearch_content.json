{"pages":[{"title":"About","text":"I started PY Consulting in 2015, hoping to advocate the value of POC (proof-of-concept). I have done quite a few projects, both in my leisure and as a real product, with satisfactory results measured by a view point of technology. Yet, I have not found the sweet spot to convince its business value. It has been a crusade to preach the important of POC, and why every project, every business, every application, should have, will have, and must have. There is no doubt in my mind, and I'm speaking this as a practitioner, that technologies are so complex these days that seeing a pretty web UI gives non-programmer an illusion that these can be had in a matter of days, weeks, if not hours, or even, instantly. On the one hand, this illusion is true, justified. Toolsets have been developed in thousands to facilitate numerous path of implementation. Anything, any use case, one can think of, has a solution, readily canned solution, out there. How convenient! Therefore, it is no surprise that business side takes technology for granted as if it is commodity one buys off the shelf. And indeed the technologies promote such a perception that not only technology and its product, but the worker (aka. IT people) are nothing but a product ready to buy at the expanse of a sum on credit card or payroll → just slide, violla, it's done. But on the other, this is completly untrue. Not only it is not true, I would even argue that this is exactly the wrong approach, wrong attitude, wrong perception of technology. What you see on shelf is a shrink wrapped product implemented by engineers who designed, wrote code, tested, and delivered, as a canned solution of, some problem. But it will be completly false to think that by using a credit card is an easy, quick, taking-a-minute-only to solve your problem, whatever it is. This isn't a shopping experience like others you do in life. The gap lies in a hidden fact that when you shop, say, grocery, you have an understanding of your problem, and a knowledge of your solution ← you know you want to eat cereal, and you have knowledge what cereal is, and you have even preference of which cereal you want (flavor, brand, degree of crunchiness). These are the actual foundation to make your solution, in this example buying grocery, so effective. This pattern applies to all other shoppings you do. It is this hidden knowledge that you have (but not necessarily communicated to anyone else) is making buying off the shelf product a valid solution. Now imagine you don't know these. There are zillion tools, products you can buy, but it will futile to state that any can satisfy you, because, the problem is not defined. This is exactly the gap when business approaches technology while not analyzing its own problem first, or not communicating this list of attributes (brand, flavor, crunchiness of a cereal) to your evaluation. Then, what to buy!? These tools and products will never replace the analysis and the matrix of attributes. Here comes in the value of POC. POC is a technique to manifest attributes and capture your preference in as short an iteration as possible. Nothing beats have the capability to visualize, to interact (even in an emulator), your own thoughts mapped right in front of you. However the manifest might be further from ideal, it gives you a starting point to criticize, to correct, and to progressively summarize the business objective, assumptions, and the characteristics that matter to the user and stakeholders. POC is not solution; rather, it is a method, like methods adopted in science research, to give you a path to remove noise, identify fallacy, and moving inches by inches towards, facts and truth. In this process, therefore, developer is the one who understands the tools and the process, and is a translator to map a knowledge from your mind, from business lingual, from other artifacts, into a clearly defined abstract (aka. models), that is traceable, ready for review, ready for test, ready for change, while maintaining a hold of consistency that is only achievable by means of technology. Such capacity of consistency and clarity is exactly the value that a POC offers. So either yourself is a scientist and has figured out (and better written out so others can understand), or you adopt a method that can get to the bottom of it, there is no third option exist. I have listed some demo showcases which I built over the last couple years while talking to various entrepreneurs who held a good idea and eager to bring it forward. I had the pleasure to understand their business case, and put them together using a technology stack I feel confident to take them further if they choose. All these have been written in a matter of 24 hours when the first iteration was complete, in which the UI you see, and the data models standing behind to support the case, have mostly done. It will be an exaggeration that 24 hour is all you need; but it is close. Again, it is the process, and the capability to understand the problem and to map them into a technical solution that I'm advocating, not a product or a technology that I'm investing in. If you like this idea, then we should talk; if not, good luck.","tags":"pages","url":"https://fengxia41103.github.io/myblog/about.html"},{"title":"夏雷","text":"","tags":"pages","url":"https://fengxia41103.github.io/myblog/lei.html"},{"title":"Project Euler","text":"Code 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 25 26 27 28 29 30 31 32 33 34 35 36 37 38 39 40 41 42 43 44 45 46 47 48 49 50 51 52 53 54 55 56 57 58 59 60 61 problem 1 Question : If we list all the natural numbers below 10 that are multiples of 3 or 5, we get 3, 5, 6 and 9. The sum of these multiples is 23. Find the sum of all the multiples of 3 or 5 below 1000. I'm forming a pattern on strategy: problem space : how many numbers we are to search through if using brute force → what is the value of '''n''' in ''range(n)''? In this one, problem space ''n=1000''. test criteria : what type of number we are interested in? → divisible by 3 or 5. Once you have this, another question usually surfaces is that it is may not be a good idea or even feasible to search through the entire problem space, eg. multiplication of two super large numbers → this can overwhelm the computer to the point that result is not reliable anymore. But anyway, it is not the case here. But keep that in mind. So once we have determined the summary above, the key is to define test criteria : def natural_number_divisible ( n , d ): '''Find natural number between [1,n] that is divisible by \"d\". ''' num = 0 while num < n : if num and not num % d : # num%d=0 yield num num += d With that, the rest is simply a main function wrap: def main (): n = 1000 result = 0 for d in [ 3 , 5 ]: for c in natural_number_divisible ( n , d ): result += c # multiple of 3*5 has been counted twice for c in natural_number_divisible ( n , 3 * 5 ): result -= c # final result print result problem 2 Question : Each new term in the Fibonacci sequence is generated by adding the previous two terms. By starting with 1 and 2, the first 10 terms will be: 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13, 21, 34, 55, 89, ... By considering the terms in the Fibonacci sequence whose values do not exceed four million, find the sum of the even-valued terms. The key is to learn and understand fibonacci sequence . problem space : < 4000,000 test criteria : is fibonacci number is even number def fibonacci ( N ): '''Generate Fibonacci number less than N ''' p1 = 1 p2 = 2 while p1 <= N : yield p1 p1 , p2 = p2 , p1 + p2 def main (): bound = 4000000 results = filter ( lambda x : not x % 2 , fibonacci ( bound )) print sum ( results ) Note : we are using filter which will actually build a list in memory. This works when problem space is not overwhelmingly large. What if bound=4*10&#94;100000000000 (hypothetically speaking)? Generator can run iterate up to that bound, but building in memory list would be disastrous. So here we are being cheap. A proper approach is simply counting the sum value as we go → count += next number . problem 3 Question : The prime factors of 13195 are 5, 7, 13 and 29. What is the largest prime factor of the number 600851475143 ? I certainly learned a lot from this seemingly simple question! problem space : int < 600851475143 test criteria : is prime? First of all, how to determine a number is a prime? primality test . The easiest trial division is the only one I was able to grasp after reading all the others. Further, problem space is not what seems ← it can be reduced to sqrt(n) when searching for prime factor of n ! The Sieve of Eratosthenes looks really cool, but I couldn't quite yet figure out how to implement this in code (well, I'm sure there are code snippet out there that has done this. But I want to come up one myself. Therefore, it requires me to fully understand this method in order to translate this into code I can write.) Here goes the trial division primality test: def is_prime ( n ): if n <= 1 return False elif n <= 3 : return True elif n % 2 == 0 or n % 3 == 0 : return False i = 5 while i * i <= n : if n % i == 0 or n % ( i + 2 ) == 0 : return False i += 6 return True method 1 So we then search for the next prime one and one until we find all of them, then max(list of primes) ? def next_prime ( max_prime ): i = max_prime + 2 while not is_prime ( i ): i += 2 return i def method_1 ( n ): \"\"\"Method 1 is searching for the largest prime factor from bottom up. Starting with the smallest prime number, 2, we divide target as much as possible to reduce it, then move on to the next prime number and repeat. The remainder, if is a prime, is the result. \"\"\" primes = [ 2 , 3 ] while n > 3 and not is_prime ( n ): if n >= primes [ - 1 ]: primes . append ( next_prime ( primes [ - 1 ])) for p in primes : if n % p == 0 : while n > p and n % p == 0 : n = n / p print 'max prime' , n method 2 That's a waste! There is a smarter way to this problem. max problem space is < sqrt(n) What is n's prime factor y ? → n is divisible by y ! So if we ever find a y , we can reduce n by n /= y . This will shrink problem space each step we take. next, instead finding prime factors, we are to eliminate all non-prime factors! If given a divisible prime, say 2 , we can keep looping n /= 2 until it is not divisible by 2 any further. This would have eliminated all factors that are multiple of 2. By this point, n has probably been reduced quite a bit. Next, search for the next divisible, 3. If we search starting with 2, we are guaranteed that next divisible, if exist, would be a prime! → therefore, the problem reduces to looping in this fashion until y is not divisible by reduced n anymore. What's left of n is the largest prime factor! def method_2 ( n ): \"\"\"Method 2 follows the same logic as method 1's. But its implementation is much simpler. We simply searching from 2 and up until we find the result. In between, we don't search for the next prime as method 1 does. Instead, we step by +1. Since the search is from bottom up, only the next prime will possibly yield a %==0 anyway, so it's the same as method 1's. \"\"\" i = 2 while i * i < n : while n % i == 0 : n = n / i i = i + 1 print ( n ) performance Method 1: 2.97s Method 2: 0.056s problem 4 Question : A palindromic number reads the same both ways. The largest palindrome made from the product of two 2-digit numbers is 9009 = 91 × 99. Find the largest palindrome made from the product of two 3-digit numbers. problem space : 100*100 &mdash; 999*999 test criteria : is palindromic ? (see problem 36 for a cool trick on palindromic test). Take the brute force way: import itertools def is_palindromic ( n ): \"\"\"Test n to be palindromic number. The easiest way, I think, is to convert \"n\" to string and test its reverse == itself. \"\"\" string_version = str ( n ) return '' . join ( reversed ( string_version )) == string_version def main (): matrix = set ( itertools . imap ( lambda ( x , y ): x * y , itertools . combinations ( range ( 100 , 999 ), 2 ))) results = filter ( lambda x : is_palindromic ( x ), matrix ) print max ( results ) A couple thoughts for improvement: this will build an in memory set with all possible combinations of 2 numbers in range(100,999) . This is ok when problem space is limited. What if the upper bound is 1 million times greater? Another thought is that product of the two numbers specified in the problem range will generate quite some redundant results, eg. 100*300 = 150*200 . problem 5 Question : 2520 is the smallest number that can be divided by each of the numbers from 1 to 10 without any remainder. What is the smallest positive number that is evenly divisible by all of the numbers from 1 to 20? problem space : < 20! test criteria : divisible by all numbers between 1-20 without redundancy, eg. %4==0 includes %2==0 . method 1 Don't know what I was thinking. Definitely an example of overthinking and over engineering. import itertools def method_1 ( target ): \"\"\"Method 1 is a bit over complex. We are to turn all target values into a list of prime factors. Then we compare each factor list to compute how many 2s, 3s.. and so on each list represents.

This master list will be able to derive all target values. \"\"\" results = {} # find prime factors for i in range ( 1 , target ): factors = [] j = 2 while j * j <= i : while i % j == 0 and i > j : i = i / j factors . append ( j ) j += 1 factors . append ( i ) for key , g in itertools . groupby ( factors ): if key in results : results [ key ] = max ( len ( list ( g )), results [ key ]) else : results [ key ] = len ( list ( g )) multiple = [] for key , count in results . iteritems (): multiple += [ key ] * count print reduce ( lambda x , y : x * y , multiple ) method 2 Much better. Build a minimum factor list of a given target. def method_2 ( target ): \"\"\"Method 2 uses a base factor list to iterate.

Find the difference between the sum of the squares of the first one hundred natural numbers and the square of the sum. problem space : int < 100 test criteria : none This problem involves nothing but math computation. Consider that problem space is so small, I didnot bother with anything else but went with brute force: def main (): n = 100 a = sum ([ i * i for i in range ( 1 , n + 1 )]) b = sum ( range ( 1 , n + 1 )) b = b * b print b - a problem 7 Question By listing the first six prime numbers: 2, 3, 5, 7, 11, and 13, we can see that the 6th prime is 13. What is the 10 001st prime number? Another prime number problem. problem space : much greater than 10001. I would think prime numbers are spaced out further and further when moving away from 2. test criteria : is prime? is the 10001st one? Since we have done primality test in problem 3 , the easiest way is simply counting how many primes we got: def main (): n = 10001 count = 1 i = 3 while count < n : if is_prime ( i ): count += 1 i += 2 print ' %d th prime is' % n , i - 2 Note that we start with i=3 so we have skipped counting 2 and 3 → thus the correct counter is i-2 . analysis How (un)linear are prime numbers found within natural numbers? Using the first 10,000 of them for a quick analysis surprisingly reveals that they are quite linear with small jigzags but not much. First 10,000 primes First 100 primes 9,900th-10,000th primes problem 8 Question : The four adjacent digits in the 1000-digit number that have the greatest product are 9 × 9 × 8 × 9 = 5832 . 73167176531330624919225119674426574742355349194934 96983520312774506326239578318016984801869478851843 85861560789112949495459501737958331952853208805511 12540698747158523863050715693290963295227443043557 66896648950445244523161731856403098711121722383113 62229893423380308135336276614282806444486645238749 30358907296290491560440772390713810515859307960866 70172427121883998797908792274921901699720888093776 65727333001053367881220235421809751254540594752243 52584907711670556013604839586446706324415722155397 53697817977846174064955149290862569321978468622482 83972241375657056057490261407972968652414535100474 82166370484403199890008895243450658541227588666881 16427171479924442928230863465674813919123162824586 17866458359124566529476545682848912883142607690042 24219022671055626321111109370544217506941658960408 07198403850962455444362981230987879927244284909188 84580156166097919133875499200524063689912560717606 05886116467109405077541002256983155200055935729725 71636269561882670428252483600823257530420752963450 Find the thirteen adjacent digits in the 1000-digit number that have the greatest product.

What is the greatest product of four adjacent numbers in the same direction (up, down, left, right, or diagonally) in the 20×20 grid? problem space : 20x20 int matrix test criteria : 4 numbers are selected by proper indexing, and find max([sums]) . The challenge is how to select four numbers in the same pattern as the example shown above. Note that requirement is to count both horizontally and vertically adjacent numbers, but also diagonally adjacent ones → this includes diagonal numbers in both directions ← from left to right and from right to left. For example, diagonally left to right, first number's index is i , if the first index is i , next index is i+20*1+1 , then i+20*2+2 , then i+20*3+3 . Not bad. First, we flatten the matrix into a list of integer. def main (): matrix = ''' 08 02 22 97 38 15 00 40 00 75 04 05 07 78 52 12 50 77 91 08 49 49 99 40 17 81 18 57 60 87 17 40 98 43 69 48 04 56 62 00 81 49 31 73 55 79 14 29 93 71 40 67 53 88 30 03 49 13 36 65 52 70 95 23 04 60 11 42 69 24 68 56 01 32 56 71 37 02 36 91 22 31 16 71 51 67 63 89 41 92 36 54 22 40 40 28 66 33 13 80 24 47 32 60 99 03 45 02 44 75 33 53 78 36 84 20 35 17 12 50 32 98 81 28 64 23 67 10 26 38 40 67 59 54 70 66 18 38 64 70 67 26 20 68 02 62 12 20 95 63 94 39 63 08 40 91 66 49 94 21 24 55 58 05 66 73 99 26 97 17 78 78 96 83 14 88 34 89 63 72 21 36 23 09 75 00 76 44 20 45 35 14 00 61 33 97 34 31 33 95 78 17 53 28 22 75 31 67 15 94 03 80 04 62 16 14 09 53 56 92 16 39 05 42 96 35 31 47 55 58 88 24 00 17 54 24 36 29 85 57 86 56 00 48 35 71 89 07 05 44 44 37 44 60 21 58 51 54 17 58 19 80 81 68 05 94 47 69 28 73 92 13 86 52 17 77 04 89 55 40 04 52 08 83 97 35 99 16 07 97 57 32 16 26 26 79 33 27 98 66 88 36 68 87 57 62 20 72 03 46 33 67 46 55 12 32 63 93 53 69 04 42 16 73 38 25 39 11 24 94 72 18 08 46 29 32 40 62 76 36 20 69 36 41 72 30 23 88 34 62 99 69 82 67 59 85 74 04 36 16 20 73 35 29 78 31 90 01 74 31 49 71 48 86 81 16 23 57 05 54 01 70 54 71 83 51 54 69 16 92 33 48 61 43 52 01 89 19 67 48 ''' matrix = [ int ( x ) for x in matrix . replace ( ' \\n ' , ' ' ) . strip () . split ( ' ' )] row_size = 20 col_size = 20 n = 4 method 1 In this method, we count index in a brute force fashion → 4 directions to count: horizontal vertical diagonal from left to right and diagonal from right to left horizontal Horizontal selection is a moving window of a size n (n=4) . By iterating through rows and columns, selection is row[col_index:col_index+n] : def horizontal ( self ): results = [] for r in range ( self . row_size ): for c in range ( self . col_size - self . n + 1 ): num = self . matrix [ r * self . row_size + c : r * self . row_size + c + self . n ] results . append ( num ) return results vertical Vertical is straightforward: column index is fixed, we are to select row_index → row_index+4 : def vertical ( self ): results = [] for r in range ( self . row_size - self . n + 1 ): for c in range ( self . col_size ): num = [] for j in range ( self . n ): index = ( r + j ) * self . row_size + c num . append ( self . matrix [ index ]) results . append ( num ) return results diagonal left to right Similar to counting vertically, we also shift column index by 1 per row iteration: def diagonal_right ( self ): '''Find diagonal adjacent numbers per requirement. The one counts from left to right. ''' results = [] # iterate row for r in range ( self . row_size - self . n + 1 ): # iterate col for c in range ( self . col_size - self . n + 1 ): num = [] # iterate adjacent per requirement for j in range ( self . n ): index = ( r + j ) * self . row_size + c + j if index >= len ( self . matrix ): break else : num . append ( self . matrix [ index ]) results . append ( num ) return results diagonal right to left Basically the opposite of diagonal selection from left to right → by reducing column index by 1 per row iteration: def diagonal_left ( self ): '''Find diagonal adjacent numbers per requirement. This one counts from right to left. ''' results = [] # iterate row for r in range ( self . row_size - self . n + 1 ): # iterate col for c in range ( self . n , self . col_size ): num = [] # iterate adjacent per requirement for j in list ( reversed ( range ( self . n ))): index = ( r + j ) * self . row_size + c - j if index >= len ( self . matrix ): break else : num . append ( self . matrix [ index ]) results . append ( num ) return results method 2 Apparently finding index as above is tedious and error prone. Instead of moving indexes, how about moving the matrix itself instead? Among all four selections, horizontal moving window is the easiest. So how about moving matrix in a way that counting vertical and diagonal becoming horizontal? The clue lies in: vertical → horizontal: transpose left & right and right→left: reverse a list moving window Moving window is to select 4 rows each time from the entire matrix: def moving_window ( self , data , window_size ): combo = [] for i in range ( len ( data ) - window_size + 1 ): combo . append ( data [ i : i + window_size ]) return combo horizontal Horizontal selection is easy: def horizontal ( self , matrix , window_size ): results = [ self . moving_window ( row , window_size ) for row in matrix ] return reduce ( lambda x , y : x + y , results ) vertical This is a neat trick on how to transpose a matrix: zip(*self.matrix) where self.matrix is a list of list mimicing a matrix. Once matrix has been turned 90 degrees, vertical counting becomes horizontal! # transpose matrix and count verticals results += self . horizontal ( zip ( * self . matrix ), self . n ) diagonal left to right The idea is to first take a subset of matrix ( moving_window() ), assuming that first row is fixed, shifting the other 3 lines to the left → 2nd line shifted by 1, 3rd line shifted by 2, 4th line shifted by 4 → so the selection is actually lining up vertically . Well, then we know how to select vertical , don't we :) How to shift? by using list's pop method (popping from left) and append 0s to the right. Note that because shifting will be in place, meaning the original list will change, it is necessary to make a deepcopy of the picked subset so the original matrix is intact. def diagonal ( self , matrix , window_size ): tmp = self . moving_window ( matrix , window_size ) results = [] for sub_set in tmp : # we need to make a copy since we are to shift # rows in place. Since sub_set is a list[list], # deepcopy is needed! sub_set_copy = deepcopy ( sub_set ) # shift rows so diagnoal numbers will then be aligned # vertically. for idx , sub in enumerate ( sub_set_copy ): for i in range ( idx ): sub . pop ( 0 ) sub . append ( 0 ) # transpose vertical to horizontal, and done :) results += self . horizontal ( zip ( * sub_set_copy ), window_size ) return results diagonal right to left This is the mirror action of diagonal left to right → we can flip the matrix: # diagonal right to left # first we reverse the matrix, then treat it as left -> right reversed_matrix = [ list ( reversed ( m )) for m in self . matrix ] results += self . diagonal ( reversed_matrix , self . n ) problem 12 Question : The sequence of triangle numbers is generated by adding the natural numbers. So the 7 th triangle number would be 1 + 2 + 3 + 4 + 5 + 6 + 7 = 28. The first ten terms would be: 1, 3, 6, 10, 15, 21, 28, 36, 45, 55, ... Let us list the factors of the first seven triangle numbers: 1 : 1 3 : 1,3 6 : 1,2,3,6 10 : 1,2,5,10 15 : 1,3,5,15 21 : 1,3,7,21 28 : 1,2,4,7,14,28 We can see that 28 is the first triangle number to have over five divisors. What is the value of the first triangle number to have over five hundred divisors? problem space : < 500! , but this is too much to iterate test criteria : is divisor of n ? > 500 divisors in total? find divisors The dummy way to search for divisors of a number n . Note the problem space of this is sqrt of n . def divisors ( n ): \"\"\"Find all divisors given number \"n\". Note that problem space is sqrt(n) since factors will repeat themselves passing that point. This greatly reduced number of iteration needed. \"\"\" i = 1 while i * i <= n : if n % i == 0 : yield [ i , n / i ] i += 1 method 1 Brute force. One thing to note is the starting point. Knowing the result is 12374, we could potentially see how we can manipulate the starting value of m in order to reduce searching time ← this is an after thought. def method_1 ( n ): max_count = 0 m =

53503534226472524250874054075591789781264330331690 problem space : given 100 50-digit numbers test criteria : none given. The challenge is how to keep track of sum result. How to count the most significant 10 digits of this sum? Don't brute force this one. Instead, we are back to the basics of summing two numbers → add least significant digits, and carry over overflow → this reduced math to adding at most 100 single digit numbers plus a carry over value (which is bound to be < 100*9 !) each time, how wonderful! Trick to add single digits is to transpose matrix so it turns from visually vertical to horizontal: def main (): n = '''......''' # <-- that matrix m = 10 matrix = n . strip () . split ( ' \\n ' ) # flip and transpose # flip: start computing from lower digit and # up, like human does # # transpose: computing as a horizontal list # instead of visually vertical matrix = [ list ( reversed ( x )) for x in matrix ] matrix = zip ( * matrix ) overflow = 0 result = [] for l in matrix : total = sum ([ int ( x ) for x in l ]) + overflow # this is the digit residual result . append ( total - total / 10 * 10 ) # next overflow overflow = total / 10 # flip back so lower digit is on the right most result = list ( reversed ( result )) print [ overflow ] + result [: 10 - len ( str ( overflow ))] problem 14 Question : The following iterative sequence is defined for the set of positive integers: n → n /2 ( n is even) n → 3 n + 1 ( n is odd) Using the rule above and starting with 13, we generate the following sequence: 13 → 40 → 20 → 10 → 5 → 16 → 8 → 4 → 2 → 1 It can be seen that this sequence (starting at 13 and finishing at 1) contains 10 terms. Although it has not been proved yet (Collatz Problem), it is thought that all starting numbers finish at 1. Which starting number, under one million, produces the longest chain? NOTE: Once the chain starts the terms are allowed to go above one million. problem space : int < 1000,000 test criteria : max length of chain, chain is created based on the rule given def main (): n = 1000000 max_len = 0 for i in range ( n , 1 , - 1 ): chain_len = len ( list ( chain ( i ))) max_len = max ( max_len , chain_len ) print i , chain_len chain Nothing fancy here. Go by the rules: def chain ( n ): while n > 1 : yield n if n % 2 : n = 3 * n + 1 else : n = n / 2 problem 15 Question : Starting in the top left corner of a 2×2 grid, and only being able to move to the right and down, there are exactly 6 routes to the bottom right corner. How many such routes are there through a 20×20 grid? This is a typical dynamic programming problem (and my first time encounter this concept). def main (): n = 21 # number of nodes, not legs, per side grid = [ 0 ] * n * n for i in range ( 1 , n ): grid [ i * n ] = 1 grid [ i ] = 1 for x in range ( n ): for y in range ( n ): if not grid [ x * n + y ]: grid [ x * n + y ] = grid [( x - 1 ) * n + y ] + grid [ x * n + y - 1 ] print grid , max ( grid ) Well, it turned out, this does not need computing even! Answer is 40!/(20!*20!) , what!!!!? Consider an example solution to the problem. It would be a list of 40 moves. The heart of this method lies in realizing that every single path will consist of exactly 20 downward movements and 20 rightward movements. As there are only two possible movements (down, right) we can represent these paths as binary strings with a 0 indicating a down move and a 1 for a right. Consider two sets, P and B. P will be the set of all paths from the starting position to the finish position consisting of only downward and rightward movements (shortest paths). B will be the set of all binary strings of length 40 consisting of exactly 20 0's and 20 1's. Clearly the cardinality of P is the solution to the problem. If we can establish a bijection from P to B, then we can say, by the bijective principle, that |B| = |P|. Consider an arbitrary path, p, in P. We can clearly create a binary string representation of p using the rules mentioned above. Therefore our map M:P -> B is surjective. And the fact that every binary string representation represents a unique path implies that M is injective. Therefore M is bijective. We can calculate the cardinality of B, |B|, by labeling each digit in a given string with an index. The question is then simplified into \"How many ways can 20 digits, identified by their indices, of a binary string of length 40 be chosen to be 0 (or 1)?\" In other words, how many ways can we scatter the 20 downward (or rightward) movements throughout the path? The answer to which is 40 choose 20, or 137846528820. and someone mentioned Pascal's triangle , but I don't get this. problem 16 Question : 2 15 = 32768 and the sum of its digits is 3 + 2 + 7 + 6 + 8 = 26 . What is the sum of the digits of the number 2 1000 ? Didn't even bother with analysis because this problem is easy. The only concern is whether Python math can handle large number such as ''2**100'' → it does, but I would consider this to be '''not scalable'''. How about 2 to the power of 1000,000? I need to rethink this one. def main (): print sum ( map ( int , str ( 2 ** 1000 ))) Going through posts in discussion thread , only one person raised this question. Others went with computing 2**100 first and convert it to string. However, it did confirm with my concern that some language, eg. EMACScript, can only handle 2**53 , and java has to use BitInt package. So the concern is valid but no one offers a clean solution. problem 17 Question : If the numbers 1 to 5 are written out in words: one, two, three, four, five, then there are 3 + 3 + 5 + 4 + 4 = 19 letters used in total. If all the numbers from 1 to 1000 (one thousand) inclusive were written out in words, how many letters would be used? NOTE: Do not count spaces or hyphens. For example, 342 (three hundred and forty-two) contains 23 letters and 115 (one hundred and fifteen) contains 20 letters. The use of \"and\" when writing out numbers is in compliance with British usage. problem space : int in [1, 1000] inclusive test criteria : none really. we are to turn digits into ordinal representation. I don't see there is a shortcut to this problem. Just build a mapping between digit to its english name, and strip off all white spaces when counting. def main (): n = 1000 ordinals = { 0 : '' , 1 : 'one' , 2 : 'two' , 3 : 'three' , 4 : 'four' , 5 : 'five' , 6 : 'six' , 7 : 'seven' , 8 : 'eight' , 9 : 'nine' , 10 : 'ten' , 11 : 'eleven' , 12 : 'twelve' , 13 : 'thirteen' , 14 : 'fourteen' , 15 : 'fifteen' , 16 : 'sixteen' , 17 : 'seventeen' , 18 : 'eighteen' , 19 : 'nineteen' , 20 : 'twenty' , 30 : 'thirty' , 40 : 'forty' , 50 : 'fifty' , 60 : 'sixty' , 70 : 'seventy' , 80 : 'eighty' , 90 : 'ninety' , 100 : 'hundred' , 1000 : 'thousand' , } results = [] for x in range ( 1 , n + 1 ): tmp = '' if x in ordinals and x not in [ 100 , 1000 ]: tmp = ordinals [ x ] else : if x / 1000 : thousand = x / 1000 tmp = ordinals [ thousand ] + ordinals [ 1000 ] x = x - x / 1000 * 1000 if x / 100 : # 3-digit numbers hundred = x / 100 tmp += ordinals [ hundred ] + ordinals [ 100 ] x = x - x / 100 * 100 if x : tmp += 'and' if x not in ordinals and x / 10 : # 2-digit numbers ten = x / 10 * 10 tmp += ordinals [ ten ] x = x - ten tmp += ordinals [ x ] results . append ( tmp ) print results print sum ([ len ( x ) for x in results ]) problem 18 Question : By starting at the top of the triangle below and moving to adjacent numbers on the row below, the maximum total from top to bottom is 23. 3 7 4 2 4 6 8 5 9 3 That is, 3 + 7 + 4 + 9 = 23. Find the maximum total from top to bottom of the triangle below: 75 95 64 17 47 82 18 35 87 10 20 04 82 47 65 19 01 23 75 03 34 88 02 77 73 07 63 67 99 65 04 28 06 16 70 92 41 41 26 56 83 40 80 70 33 41 48 72 33 47 32 37 16 94 29 53 71 44 65 25 43 91 52 97 51 14 70 11 33 28 77 73 17 78 39 68 17 57 91 71 52 38 17 14 91 43 58 50 27 29 48 63 66 04 68 89 53 67 30 73 16 69 87 40 31 04 62 98 27 23 09 70 98 73 93 38 53 60 04 23 NOTE : As there are only 16384 routes, it is possible to solve this problem by trying every route. However, Problem 67 is the same challenge with a triangle containing one-hundred rows; it cannot be solved by brute force, and requires a clever method! ;o) problem space : given matrix test criteria : max of sum of picked route But, as indicated by the problem, do not use route as computation base. We are moving from top of the pyramid to bottom. So option is the 1st row is deterministic ! It has to be 75. What about 2nd row? If we are to maximize sum, we of course want to pick the max of the two → 95? But wait a minute! The 3rd row also plays a role in this decision. There are 4 possible sums: 95+17 95+47 64+47 64+82 So we are to use this to determine which one to take. In other words, the next decision always present 4 possible combinations. We are to pick the one that yields the max. So this means we want to ''peek ahead'' 1 row beyond the next one. Once we hit the bottom of the pyramid, decision reduces to 2 options. Well, then pick the largest sum ← this is also the break condition, isn't it!? def main (): \"\"\" The catch of this problem is you can only select the adjacent number of the next row. \"\"\" data = ''' 75 95 64 17 47 82 18 35 87 10 20 04 82 47 65 19 01 23 75 03 34 88 02 77 73 07 63 67 99 65 04 28 06 16 70 92 41 41 26 56 83 40 80 70 33 41 48 72 33 47 32 37 16 94 29 53 71 44 65 25 43 91 52 97 51 14 70 11 33 28 77 73 17 78 39 68 17 57 91 71 52 38 17 14 91 43 58 50 27 29 48 63 66 04 68 89 53 67 30 73 16 69 87 40 31 04 62 98 27 23 09 70 98 73 93 38 53 60 04 23 ''' # build matrix data = [ x . strip () . split ( ' ' ) for x in data . strip () . split ( ' \\n ' )] data = [[ int ( y ) for y in x ] for x in data ] col_idx = row_idx = 0 pick = [] while row_idx < len ( data ): pick . append ( data [ row_idx ][ col_idx ]) max_combo = ( 0 , 0 ) next_col_idx = 0 # next row, 2 options if row_idx < len ( data ) - 1 : for i in [ 0 , 1 ]: x = data [ row_idx + 1 ][ col_idx + i ] # next row + 1, another 2 options for j in [ 0 , 1 ]: if row_idx < len ( data ) - 2 : y = data [ row_idx + 2 ][ col_idx + i + j ] else : y = 0 # whoever yields the max sum wins if sum (( x , y )) > sum ( max_combo ): max_combo = ( x , y ) next_col_idx = col_idx + i # keep track of which col we are current on col_idx = next_col_idx # move on to the next row row_idx += 1 print pick print sum ([ int ( x ) for x in pick ]) problem 19 Question : You are given the following information, but you may prefer to do some research for yourself. 1 Jan 1900 was a Monday. Thirty days has September, April, June and November. All the rest have thirty-one, Saving February alone, Which has twenty-eight, rain or shine. And on leap years, twenty-nine. A leap year occurs on any year evenly divisible by 4, but not on a century unless it is divisible by 400. How many Sundays fell on the first of the month during the twentieth century (1 Jan 1901 to 31 Dec 2000)? problem space : 1/1/1901 - 12/31/2000 test criteria : is 1st day of a month? is Sunday? Such a small problem space that it is not necessary to overthink this problem. Iterate and check: from datetime import date from datetime import timedelta def main (): count = 0 start = date ( 1901 , 1 , 1 ) while start . year < 2001 : # check requirements # 1. 1st day of a month # 2. is a Sunday if start . day == 1 and start . weekday () == 6 : count += 1 print start start += timedelta ( days = 1 ) print count problem 20 Question : n ! means n × ( n − 1) × ... × 3 × 2 × 1 For example, 10! = 10 × 9 × ... × 3 × 2 × 1 = 3628800, and the sum of the digits in the number 10! is 3 + 6 + 2 + 8 + 8 + 0 + 0 = 27. Find the sum of the digits in the number 100! problem space : n!, n = 100 test criteria : none The challenge is supposed to computing n! . But in modern computer this is nothing. I know this is the cheap way to solve it, but works. def main (): n = 100 p = 1 while n > 0 : p = p * n n = n - 1 print sum ([ int ( x ) for x in str ( p )]) problem 21 Question : Let d( n ) be defined as the sum of proper divisors of n (numbers less than n which divide evenly into n ). If d( a ) = b and d( b ) = a , where a ≠ b , then a and b are an amicable pair and each of a and b are called amicable numbers. For example, the proper divisors of 220 are 1, 2, 4, 5, 10, 11, 20, 22, 44, 55 and 110; therefore d(220) = 284. The proper divisors of 284 are 1, 2, 4, 71 and 142; so d(284) = 220. Evaluate the sum of all the amicable numbers under 10000. problem space: int < 10,000 test criteria: is amicable number?

Then working out the alphabetical value for each name, multiply this value by its alphabetical position in the list to obtain a name score. For example, when the list is sorted into alphabetical order, COLIN, which is worth 3 + 15 + 12 + 9 + 14 = 53, is the 938th name in the list. So, COLIN would obtain a score of 938 × 53 = 49714. What is the total of all the name scores in the file? problem space: given .txt file test criteria: compute name score import csv import string def main (): with open ( 'p022_names.txt' , 'r' ) as f : names = list ( csv . reader ( f ))[ 0 ] names . sort () score = 0 for idx , name in enumerate ( names ): # The key is to find the character value based on # list \"A-Z\" instead of its \"ord(x)\" ordinal value! # You can use the test case \"COLIN\" to verify. score += ( idx + 1 ) * \\ sum ([ string . ascii_uppercase . find ( x ) + 1 for x in name ]) print score Note the trick: string . ascii_uppercase . find ( 'A' ) will find the ordinal value of character A . problem 23 Question : A perfect number is a number for which the sum of its proper divisors is exactly equal to the number. For example, the sum of the proper divisors of 28 would be 1 + 2 + 4 + 7 + 14 = 28, which means that 28 is a perfect number. A number n is called deficient if the sum of its proper divisors is less than n and it is called abundant if this sum exceeds n . As 12 is the smallest abundant number, 1 + 2 + 3 + 4 + 6 = 16, the smallest number that can be written as the sum of two abundant numbers is 24. By mathematical analysis, it can be shown that all integers greater than 28123 can be written as the sum of two abundant numbers. However, this upper limit cannot be reduced any further by analysis even though it is known that the greatest number that cannot be expressed as the sum of two abundant numbers is less than this limit. Find the sum of all the positive integers which cannot be written as the sum of two abundant numbers. problem space: int < 28123 test criteria: if a+b=c , that a or b is NOT an abundant number ? My approach is simple --- it's easy to compute sum of [1,n] (=(n+1)n/2) . Why don't we remove those numbers that are NOT meeting the test criteria! find all redundants in problem space get all possible sum(a,b) where a,b are both redundants (thus the reverse logic), including when a=b and a!=b remove these numbers from range(1,n), what's left are the ones we need def main (): n = m = 28213 # get all redundants redundants = [] while m > 0 : if sum ( divisor ( m )) > m : redundants . append ( m ) m -= 1 # remove all possible combos when a,b are both redundants # and a != b possible_sums = set ([ sum (( x , y )) for ( x , y ) in itertools . combinations ( redundants , 2 ) if sum (( x , y )) <= n ]) results = set ( range ( 1 , n + 1 )) - set ( possible_sums ) # remove all combos when a,b are both redundants # and a == b results = results - set ([ 2 * x for x in redundants if 2 * x <= n ]) # what's left are numbers meeting the test criteria print sum ( results ) problem 24 Question : A permutation is an ordered arrangement of objects. For example, 3124 is one possible permutation of the digits 1, 2, 3 and 4. If all of the permutations are listed numerically or alphabetically, we call it lexicographic order. The lexicographic permutations of 0, 1 and 2 are: 012 021 102 120 201 210 What is the millionth lexicographic permutation of the digits 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8 and 9? With help of advanced features such as the Python itertools , there isnot much to brag about. Simply create the permutation list, sort and pop by the requesting index. import itertools def main (): index = 1000000 n = range ( 10 ) permu = list ( itertools . permutations ( n , len ( n ))) permu . sort () print permu . pop ( index - 1 ) problem 25 Question : The Fibonacci sequence is defined by the recurrence relation: F n = F n −1 + F n −2 , where F 1 = 1 and F 2 = 1. Hence the first 12 terms will be: F 1 = 1 F 2 = 1 F 3 = 2 F 4 = 3 F 5 = 5 F 6 = 8 F 7 = 13 F 8 = 21 F 9 = 34 F 10 = 55 F 11 = 89 F 12 = 144 The 12th term, F 12 , is the first term to contain three digits. What is the index of the first term in the Fibonacci sequence to contain 1000 digits? problem space: int with < 1,000 digits test criteria: is a fibonacci number? Keep generating Fibonacci number until test criteria is met: def main (): n = 1000 index = 2 p1 = 1 p2 = 2 while len ( str ( p1 )) < n : p1 , p2 = p2 , p1 + p2 index += 1 print index problem 26 Question : A unit fraction contains 1 in the numerator. The decimal representation of the unit fractions with denominators 2 to 10 are given: 1 / 2 = 0.5 1 / 3 = 0.(3) 1 / 4 = 0.25 1 / 5 = 0.2 1 / 6 = 0.1(6) 1 / 7 = 0.(142857) 1 / 8 = 0.125 1 / 9 = 0.(1) 1 / 10 = 0.1 Where 0.1(6) means 0.166666..., and has a 1-digit recurring cycle. It can be seen that 1 / 7 has a 6-digit recurring cycle. Find the value of d < 1000 for which 1 / d contains the longest recurring cycle in its decimal fraction part. problem space: int < 1,000 test criteria: max of recurring pattern The challenge lies in two places: how to generate and track decimal places how to identify recurring patttern division 101 We don't know how long the recurring pattern may represent, therefore we cannot assume any number of digits will be sufficient. As a matter of fact, on my laptop Python's precision is at 17th decimal point. This eliminates the possibility of using Python's built-in divisor to generate result. One important discussion is Python's floating point document. To resolve this, we are back to basics of how division is done ← we keep multiplying 10 to the number until it is greater than the divisor → the int(a/b) is the result, (a%b) , or the remainder , is behind the decimal point, and we repeat! def decimal_fraction ( m , n , max_digits = 10 ): \"\"\"Generate division digits up to specified count. Back to the very basic of how division is done. We keep track of the remainder and multiple as many 10s as needed so it can be divided by the given divisor again, and on and on and on. Arguments: m -- numerator n -- denominator \"\"\" count = 0 while m and count < max_digits : while m < n : m *= 10 yield m / n # remainder m = m - m / n * n count += 1 identify recurring pattern Google identify recurring substring gives a clue. Good to know. # regex pattern to identify recurring substring recurring_pattern = re . compile ( r '&#94;(\\d+?)((\\d+?)\\3+)$' ) .... tmp = recurring_pattern . findall ( digits ) if tmp : pattern = tmp [ 0 ][ - 1 ] This re pattern isn't ideal, however. For 1/7 = 0.(142857) , pattern gives 428571 instead. For the purpose of this problem, the number of digits is still 6 so it didnot matter. But it is not prefect. To put it all together: def main (): n = 1000 # regex pattern to identify recurring substring recurring_pattern = re . compile ( r '&#94;(\\d+?)((\\d+?)\\3+)$' ) max_found = 0 for x in range ( 1 , n ): # this magic number is troublesome # better, we should replace this with a while loop. max_digits_to_search = 10000 digits = '' . join ( str ( y ) for y in decimal_fraction ( 1 , x , max_digits_to_search )) tmp = recurring_pattern . findall ( digits ) if tmp : pattern = tmp [ 0 ][ - 1 ] if len ( pattern ) > max_found : max_found = len ( pattern ) # print digits print x , len ( pattern ) # , tmp Another thing I didn't like was the max_digits_to_search . Since we have not idea how long the recurring pattern may be, it is arbitrary to set a bound ← what if the recurring pattern is 1 million digits long!? Ideally this should be a self-adaptable loop to adjust this value based on the finding recurring length. Here we are cheating by giving it 10 times of n . see also floating point wiki showing the right way to compare two floating numbers Python's floating point issues and notes problem 27 Question : problem space: |a| < 1000 and |b| < 1000 test criteria: n n+a n+b, n=0,1.... is prime? Clue to this problem: for n=0 → b must be a prime for n=1 , a+b+1 must be an odd number → |a| must be an odd number and |b| > |a| . def main (): n = 1000 all_primes = list ( get_primes ( n )) max_count = 0 # iterate all b for b in all_primes : # abs(a)<b, and a must be an odd number for a in range ( - 1 * b , b , 2 ): count = 0 for i in range ( 1 , n + 1 ): tmp = i * i + a * i + b if tmp > 0 and ( tmp in all_primes or is_prime ( tmp )): # count for generated primes count += 1 else : break # keep score if count > max_count : max_count = count print max_count , a , b , a * b See problem 10 for get_primes and is_prime methods. problem 28 Question : Starting with the number 1 and moving to the right in a clockwise direction a 5 by 5 spiral is formed as follows: 21 22 23 24 25 \\ 20 7 8 9 10\\ 19 6 1 2 11\\ 18 5 4 3 12\\ 17 16 15 14 13 It can be verified that the sum of the numbers on the diagonals is 101. What is the sum of the numbers on the diagonals in a 1001 by 1001 spiral formed in the same way? problem space: int < 1001x1001 test criteria: how to construct such a spiral? Wow, cannot believe this. You don't need to construct this spiral at all. Instead, observing that diagonal numbers are the 4 at the corner of each spiral, and in examples above, the smallest matrix: 7 8 9 6 1 2 5 4 3 the 4 corners are 3,5,7,9 → spaced out 2 . Next circle out: (9), 13, 17, 15, 21, 25 → spaced out by 4 ! So let's guess, the next circle out, could it be spaced out by 6? exactly! (25), 31, 37, 43, 49. Further, the matrix can only grow in odd size: 1st circle, when size is 3x3, space out by 2 2nd circle, when size is 5x5, space out by 4 3rd circle, when size is 7x7, space out by 6 Pattern is clear: for nth circle, matrix size is 2*n+1 , and step (space) is 2*n . So for given size 1001, we are looking at (1001-1)/2=500 th circle to achieve this matrix, and the step for the outer most four corners will be 2*500=1000 . def main (): n = 1001 total = m = 1 # m is the circle counter num = 1 while m < ( n + 1 ) / 2 : # need (n+1)/2 circles to achieve n by n matrix # compute 4 corner values for i in range ( 4 ): num += m * 2 # 2*m is the step total += num # next spiral, please m += 1 print 'total' , total problem 29 Question : Consider all integer combinations of a b for 2 ≤ a ≤ 5 and 2 ≤ b ≤ 5: 2 2 =4, 2 3 =8, 2 4 =16, 2 5 =32 3 2 =9, 3 3 =27, 3 4 =81, 3 5 =243 4 2 =16, 4 3 =64, 4 4 =256, 4 5 =1024 5 2 =25, 5 3 =125, 5 4 =625, 5 5 =3125 If they are then placed in numerical order, with any repeats removed, we get the following sequence of 15 distinct terms: 4, 8, 9, 16, 25, 27, 32, 64, 81, 125, 243, 256, 625, 1024, 3125 How many distinct terms are in the sequence generated by a b for 2 ≤ a ≤ 100 and 2 ≤ b ≤ 100? problem space: int < 100**100 test criteria: which (a,b) combo will generate duplicate? As I have indicated in test criteria, the key is to understand why (a,b) combo can generate duplicates, eg. 2&#94;4 = 4&#94;2 because of 4=2&#94;2 . So if we form all possible (a,b) combos, testing a1&#94;x = a2 vs. y=b2/b1 , if x=y, then a1&#94;b1 = a2&#94;b2 . Now take this analysis one step further. Any a is in form of x*y*z ... where x,y,z are primes. So if we transform a&#94;b into its prime factor fashion, we get (2x, 1y, 3z....) and so on. So instead of computing the actual number a&#94;b, we can also compare this prime form for duplicates. The benefit of doing this is obvious ← a is [2,100] inclusive, a merely one hundred numbers to search for its prime factors, a much smaller problem space . Wait!!! I'm overthinking again. This problem is solved by a one-liner (brute force): import itertools def main (): print len ( set ( a ** b for ( a , b ) in itertools . combinations ( range ( 2 , 101 ) * 2 , 2 ))) problem 30 Question : Surprisingly there are only three numbers that can be written as the sum of fourth powers of their digits: 1634 = 1 4 + 6 4 + 3 4 + 4 4 8208 = 8 4 + 2 4 + 0 4 + 8 4 9474 = 9 4 + 4 4 + 7 4 + 4 4 As 1 = 1 4 is not a sum it is not included. The sum of these numbers is 1634 + 8208 + 9474 = 19316. Find the sum of all the numbers that can be written as the sum of fifth powers of their digits. problem space: infinite → how are we to bound search range? test criteria: defined clearly in the problem, sum(fifth power of digit) = the number itself. The concern raised in determining the problem space sheds a clue on the max of this number. Max of a single digit is 9 , so the max it can contribute to a sum is 9&#94;5 = 59409 → once we move into 6-digit space, number of digits * 9&#94;5 will not be able to keep up with the growing number of digits anymore. So problem space is max-ed at 199999 ! def main (): result = 0 for i in range ( 2 , 199999 ): tmp = sum ( int ( x ) ** 5 for x in str ( i )) if tmp == i : result += i print result problem 31 Question : In England the currency is made up of pound, £, and pence, p, and there are eight coins in general circulation: 1p, 2p, 5p, 10p, 20p, 50p, £1 (100p) and £2 (200p). It is possible to make £2 in the following way: 1×£1 + 1×50p + 2×20p + 1×5p + 1×2p + 3×1p How many different ways can £2 be made using any number of coins? problem space: max number of 1p(=200) * max of 2p(=100) .... — it's a large number, but does represent the max possible space. test criteria: add up to 2 pounds Formulate this, we are to solve coefficients (a,b,c\\...g) of this equation: 1 * a + 2 * b + 5 * c + 10 * d + 20 * e + 50 * f + 100 * g + 200 * h = 200 where: a in [0,200] b in [0,100] c in [0,40] d in [0,20] e in [0,10] f in [0,4] g in [0,2] h in [0,1] Possible combinations = 201x101x41x21x11x5x3x2 — moral of the story, don't iterate through this entire space! Notice that once h=1, it eliminates 201x101x41x21x11x5x3 combos! So if drawing a matrix, half of this matrix should be empty. Now with each step we go down this path, the number of possible combo should decrease quite fast. But how to determine this and model this in code? Well, admittedly, I tried brute force (after running out of ideas) in hope to get answer first so I could read thread discussions for clues. But even that didn't work out after hours of waiting ← this gives 73681(!?) why? import itertools from operator import add def main (): n = 200 factors = [ 100 , 50 , 20 , 10 , 5 , 2 , 1 ] coefficients = map ( lambda x : 200 / x , factors ) count = 0 for a in itertools . product ( * [ range ( c + 1 ) for c in coefficients ]): tmp = reduce ( add , [ x * y for x , y in zip ( a , factors )]) if tmp == n : count += 1 print count , a print count This led me to Google for solution (not being cheap, but eager to be enlightened), I came across a great post on this problem (the detail explanation below is copied from this post). First of all, this is a typical problem of so called dynamic programming (notice the technique of memoization . I'm impressed that there is even a name for this particular problem — coin change problem ! wow. There is a similar problem called coin problem . Coin Change is the problem of finding the number of ways of making changes for a particular amount of cents, n, using a given set of denominations d 1 ... d m ~. 1p Target in cents Using only 1p Using <= 2p Using <= 5p ... 1 1 ... If I wanted to accumulate just 1 cent (column Target in cents ), how many ways are there to do it, using coins less than or equal to 1p? → Only one way — so, fill up the cell of column Using only 1p with 1. Moving on — what if I could use coins less than or equal to 2p? Target in cents Using only 1p Using <= 2p Using <= 5p ... 1 1 1 ... There is still only one way - using 1p. The 2p coins can't be used, since our target (a total of 1 cent for this line of the table) is less than 2p. So all the first line fills up with 1s: Target in cents only 1p <= 2p <= 5p <= 10p <= 20p <= 50p <= 100p <= 200p 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 Only one way to reach the target of 1 cent, no matter what coins I use. 2p What if we move to a target of 2 cents? Target in cents only 1p <= 2p <= 5p <= 10p <= 20p <= 50p <= 100p <= 200p 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 2 1 Well, using only 1p there is only one way: 1p+1p. When using coins less than or equal to 2p, however, we can also do it via a single 2p coin - so there are now 2 ways: Target in cents only 1p <= 2p <= 5p <= 10p <= 20p <= 50p <= 100p <= 200p 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 2 1 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 Additional coins don't help any - the total number of ways remains 2 (1p+1p,2p) throughout the rest of the line. Breaking it down, target: 3,4,5,... cents Thinking the same way: Target in cents only 1p <= 2p <= 5p <= 10p <= 20p <= 50p <= 100p <= 200p 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 2 1 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 3 1 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 4 1 3 3 3 3 3 3 3 5 1 3 4 4 4 4 4 4 3 cents can be formed as (1p+1p+1p,1p+2p) , so starting from column <=2p , the number is 2 4 cents can be formed as (4x1p, 2x1p+1x2p, 2x2p) , so starting from column <=2p , the number is 3 5 cents can be formed as (5x1p, 3x1p+1x2p, 1x1p+2x2p, 1x5p) , so starting from column <=5p , the number is 4 etc... So, now that we've done this process manually, what do wenotice? We notice that when forming the values in a line, the first column is always 1. There is only one way to form any target N, if you just use 1p coins: Nx1p . We also notice that when filling up a cell, we check to see if the corresponding coin \"fits\" in. If it doesn't, we just copy the value of the cell on the left - i.e. the number of ways to form a target sum doesn't change, since we can't use this column's coin. If the coin does fit, however, we then form a number by adding two things: (a) the number of ways we can form the target WITHOUT using the coin (which is on the cell on our left) plus (b) the number of ways we can form the target-columnCoin , i.e. the number of ways to form the remainder, if we subtract (i.e. use) the coin from our target. For example, on line 5 (target: 5 cents) the highlighted cell of column <=2p is formed as 1+2 : There is 1 way to form a target of 5 cents using only 1p coins (the cell on the left has value 1) If we use a coin of 2p, then the remainder is target-2p=5p-2p=3p , which we can lookup above, on line 3, and see that there are 2 ways to reach it, using <=2p . This lookup is key — we basically reuse previous calculations with a single lookup. code With all the details above, hopefully by now you can see what we are doing ← we are to build a matrix with target from 1 up to 200. Matrix's row is target value, column is coin face value. Rules: if coin value > target → copy value from left matrix[row][col-1] otherwise, value = matrix[row][col-1]+matrix[row-coin][col] def count ( row , col , coin , matrix ): target = row + 1 if col == 0 : pass # if coin > target elif coin > target : matrix [ row ][ col ] = matrix [ row ][ col - 1 ] # if coin <= target, lookup else : matrix [ row ][ col ] = matrix [ row - coin ][ col ] + matrix [ row ][ col - 1 ] return matrix def main (): # the 8 coins correspond to 8 columns coins = [ 1 , 2 , 5 , 10 , 20 , 50 , 100 , 200 ] TARGET = 200 # initialize matrix with 1s matrix = [[ 1 ] * len ( coins ) for x in range ( 1 , TARGET + 1 )] # iterate from 1 up to TARGET for t in range ( 0 , TARGET ): # iterate all coins for col , coin in enumerate ( coins ): matrix = count ( t , col , coin , matrix ) print t + 1 , matrix [ t ] problem 32 Question : We shall say that an n -digit number is pandigital if it makes use of all the digits 1 to n exactly once; for example, the 5-digit number, 15234, is 1 through 5 pandigital. The product 7254 is unusual, as the identity, 39 × 186 = 7254, containing multiplicand, multiplier, and product is 1 through 9 pandigital. Find the sum of all products whose multiplicand/multiplier/product identity can be written as a 1 through 9 pandigital. HINT: Some products can be obtained in more than one way so be sure to only include it once in your sum. Wiki definition of pandigital number is different from the one given in the problem. in wiki: In mathematics, a pandigital number is an integer that in a given base has among its significant digits each digit used in the base at least once . in problem: exactly once Which one is correct? According to Wolfram Mathworld , there are 4 flavors, all are valid pandigital numbers : | including zero? | digits | frequency | |-------------------+----------+-----------------| | yes | 0-9 | exactly once | | yes | 0-9 | at least once | | no | 1-9 | exactly once | | no | 1-9 | at least once | Follow problem instructions, problem space: 1-9, exactly once, max will be 987654321 → without considering test criteria, max space is sqrt(987654321) → 31,427. test criteria: a*b=c and digits in a,b,c together forms a pandigital number → considering all digits together is 9 digits in length → max(c) can only be a 4-digit number, and max(a) a 4-digit number and max(b) a 2-digit number. So the max problem space is actually becoming 9999*99 . def main (): n = 9 products = [] for a in range ( 1 , 10000 ): for b in range ( 1 , 100 ): c = a * b tmp = ' %d%d%d ' % ( a , b , c ) if '0' in tmp : continue # too many digits if len ( tmp ) != n : continue # is 1-9 pendigital number? if len ( set ( tmp )) == len ( tmp ): # exactly once products . append ( c ) print a , 'x' , b , '=' , c , tmp print sum ( set ( products )) problem 33 Question : The fraction 49 / 98 is a curious fraction, as an inexperienced mathematician in attempting to simplify it may incorrectly believe that 49 / 98 = 4 / 8 , which is correct, is obtained by cancelling the 9s. We shall consider fractions like, 30 / 50 = 3 / 5 , to be trivial examples. There are exactly four non-trivial examples of this type of fraction, less than one in value, and containing two digits in the numerator and denominator. If the product of these four fractions is given in its lowest common terms, find the value of the denominator. problem space: numerator and denominator are 2-digit number → both < 99, pretty small space test criteria: in form a*10+b/b*10+c ← c!=0 , and fraction == a/c fraction is < 1 Coding is straightforward. Using fractions package, it automatically reduce fraction to its lowest common term, eg. Fraction(12,15) becomes Fraction(4,5). from fractions import Fraction def main (): result = 1 for x in range ( 11 , 100 ): for y in range ( x + 1 , 100 ): # test criteria: y not multiple of 10 if y % 10 == 0 : continue # test criteria: not in non-trivial pattern if x % 10 != y / 10 : continue # test criteria: is the type of fraction if Fraction ( x , y ) == Fraction ( x / 10 , y % 10 ): result *= Fraction ( x , y ) print result problem 34 Question : 145 is a curious number, as 1! + 4! + 5! = 1 + 24 + 120 = 145. Find the sum of all numbers which are equal to the sum of the factorial of their digits. Note: as 1! = 1 and 2! = 2 are not sums they are not included. These type of numbers are called Factorion , and their sum are mathematically explained here . problem space: similar to problem 30 , adding 9!=362880 is a clue on the bound ← growing a decimal point will out pace adding a factorial at 7th digit. So problem space must be < 1000,000. test criteria: as indicated in problem, sum(factorial(digit in num)) = num from math import factorial def main (): # bound n = 500000 # factorials of 0-9. Note: f(0) = 1 factorials = [ factorial ( x ) for x in range ( 0 , 10 )] # iterate all nubmers in bound result = 0 for x in range ( 1 , n ): tmp = sum ( factorials [ int ( s )] for s in str ( x )) if x == tmp : result += x print tmp print result - ( 1 + 2 ) Note: 500000 is the upper bound I tweaked after knowing the correct answer. Since UB(upper bound) is the key in this solution, I liked this post found in discussion: Your upper bound should be based on the intersection of y=x and y=9!*log(x). The first equation is the progression of the value of a number, the second is the progression of the maximum value for a digit (9!) times the number of digits. In this case your intersection is just before 2,309,171. After that point, the sum of the factorials of the digits of a number (even if they were all 9s) will never exceed the value of the number itself. problem 35 Question : The number, 197, is called a circular prime because all rotations of the digits: 197, 971, and 719, are themselves prime. There are thirteen such primes below 100: 2, 3, 5, 7, 11, 13, 17, 31, 37, 71, 73, 79, and 97. How many circular primes are there below one million? problem space: int < 1000,000 test criteria: is prime? is circular variation a prime? All numbers in problem space are in form a*100000+b*10000+c*1000+d*100+e*10+f where 0<=a,b,c,d,e,f<=9 . How many circular numbers it can generate? → 5. In general, for a n-digit number, it can have n-1 circular variations. We can eliminate a couple obvious cases: if f coefficient is 5, a circular variable is divisible by 5 → no 5 in (a,b,c,d,e,f) if f is even, a circular variation is divisible by 2 → all coefficients are odd if f is 0, a circular variation is divisible by 10 → all coefficients are > 0 This makes the option pretty limited, they can only be 1,3,7,9! → for 6-digit number: possible combinations 4**6=4096 . for 5-digit number: 4**5=1024 and so forth Total possible numbers, therefore, are 5,460. Not bad. With this established, the only one that stands a chance is itself needs to be a prime first. That should eliminate combination that only contains 3 and 9 because they would be divisible by 3 → among the 5,460 combos, if it is >10, then it must have 1 or 7 in it. Now to the circular variations. An obvious case is that if all coefficients are equal and the number itself is prime, then we find one already because it has no circular variation. For the others, its circular must be within the 5,460 combos. So if we pick out all the primes among them first, we can turn the test from whether its circular variation is prime to whether a prime is a circular version of another prime. from p10 import is_prime from itertools import permutations from collections import deque def main (): n = 1000000 results = [] for digits in range ( 2 , 7 ): # save all primes of n-digit primes = [] tens = [ 10 ** i for i in range ( digits )] coeff = permutations ([ 1 , 3 , 7 , 9 ] * digits , digits ) # iterate coefficient combo for c in set ( coeff ): # test criteria: 1 or 7 in coeff if 1 not in c and 7 not in c : continue # target number num = reduce ( lambda x , y : x + y , [ x * y for x , y in zip ( c , tens )]) # test criteria: is prime? if is_prime ( num ): primes . append ( c ) # test criteria: is circular variation a prime? for c in primes : # circular tmp = deque ( c ) i = 1 while tuple ( tmp ) in primes and i < digits + 1 : tmp . rotate ( - 1 ) i += 1 if i == digits + 1 : print ' %d digits' % digits , c results . append ( c ) # plus 2,3,5,7 back print len ( set ( results )) + 4 problem 36 Question : The decimal number, 585 = 1001001001 2 (binary), is palindromic in both bases. Find the sum of all numbers, less than one million, which are palindromic in base 10 and base 2. (Please note that the palindromic number, in either base, may not include leading zeros.) problem space: int < 1000,000 test criteria: is palindromic ? A palindromic number is symmetrical . A more mathematical description can be found here . Testing palindromic is to simply flip str(a) and compare two strings being equal. def main (): n = 1000000 # palindromic test test = ( lambda x : x == x [:: - 1 ]) # iterate problem space result = 0 for i in range ( 1 , n ): # test criteria: ending 0 if i % 10 == 0 : continue # test criteria: most significant == least significant if str ( i )[ 0 ] != str ( i )[ - 1 ]: continue # test criteria: palindromic # Note: bin(a) generates \"0b101...\" -> strip off \"0b\" if test ( str ( i )) and test ( bin ( i )[ 2 :]): print i result += i print result A nice trick indeed to flip a string: this_string [:: - 1 ] Nice! How about a one-liner, a true beauty: #Use only odd numbers as reverse in binary will have leading zero print sum ( filter ( lambda x : x % 10 != 0 and str ( x ) == str ( x )[:: - 1 ] and bin ( x )[ 2 :] == bin ( x )[ 2 :][:: - 1 ], xrange ( 1 , 1000000 , 2 ))) problem 37 Question : The number 3797 has an interesting property. Being prime itself, it is possible to continuously remove digits from left to right, and remain prime at each stage: 3797, 797, 97, and 7. Similarly we can work from right to left: 3797, 379, 37, and 3. Find the sum of the only eleven primes that are both truncatable from left to right and right to left. NOTE: 2, 3, 5, and 7 are not considered to be truncatable primes. problem space : unknown, this is problematic test criteria : is prime? is truncated version also prime? A bit similar to problem 35 , if truncated version is also a prime, digits must meet these 2 criteria: only 3, 7, or 9 ← any even number will result in a truncated version being even, and any 5 or 0 will make it non-prime. A special case is 1 ← 1 is not a prime, so won't work. 2 has a double identity — both an even number and a prime. Because we will be truncating in both direction, its being an even number won't work, thus eliminated also. 9 can not be on either end ← otherwise, it will can be truncated into a single 9 and is not a prime → so the number has to both start and end with 3 or 7. Further trial showed that the eligible number has to either start with 73 or 37, and ends with 37 or 73. Now instead of getting all the prime first in arbitrary space and test for circular validity, how about building the number from all primes less than 100? This turned out to be much more efficient than previous approach. Given a prime number, say 37, we can extend it to right by 37*10+[3,7,9] , and to left by [3,7,9]*10+37 . We then test the primality of new number, if it is a prime, extend further; otherwise, we can stop here. When do we know we hit the hard wall? when extending with [3,7,9] does not yield any prime anymore. So going from both direction we are to guarantee all space by the test criteria. def extend_right ( num , depth ): \"\"\"Recursion by extending number from left to right.

We will call 192384576 the concatenated product of 192 and (1,2,3) The same can be achieved by starting with 9 and multiplying by 1, 2, 3, 4, and 5, giving the pandigital, 918273645, which is the concatenated product of 9 and (1,2,3,4,5). What is the largest 1 to 9 pandigital 9-digit number that can be formed as the concatenated product of an integer with (1,2, ... , n ) where n > 1? problem space: 100,000,000 < product < 999,999,999, because product must be a 9-digit number test criteria: product is a 9-digit pandigital? If product is bound by 9 digits, this becomes quite easy: n = 2 → x is max at 4 digit → x + 2*x can generate a 9-digit n = 3 → x is max at 3 digit (as example shown) n = 4 → x is max at 2 digit Now think about it, we can narrow this down even further — if we are to search for the largest 9-digit number, it has to start with 9. Some posts say it also needs to be 4-digit. This I actually doubt even though it was so at the end. I think iterating 2-4 is a safer bet. method 1 from operator import add def method_1 (): max_digits = 9 # 1-9 pandigital test test = lambda x : set ( '123456789' ) == set ( x ) # iterate problem space result = 0 for n in [ 2 , 3 , 4 ]: # number of digits for i in range ( 10 ** ( n - 1 ) * 9 , 10 ** n ): # potential numbers # concatenated sum strings tmp = reduce ( add , [ str ( i * j ) for j in range ( 1 , max_digits / n + 1 )]) # pandigital test if test ( tmp ): print 'found' , n , i , tmp result = max ( result , tmp ) print result Notice how we test 1-9 pandigital number? test = lambda x : set ( '123456789' ) == set ( x ) What a beauty! method 2 If we can establish that the number has four digits, the code can be dramatically simplified: def method_2 (): \"\"\"Same solution with assumption that the number has 9 digits and starts with 9 -> 9xxx. \"\"\" for x in range ( 9000 , 10000 ): st = str ( x ) + str ( x * 2 ) if set ( '123456789' ) == set ( st ): print x , st problem 39 Question : If p is the perimeter of a right angle triangle with integral length sides, { a , b , c }, there are exactly three solutions for p = 120. {20,48,52}, {24,45,51}, {30,40,50} For which value of p ≤ 1000, is the number of solutions maximised? problem space: a+b+c < 1,000 test criteria: is a triangle? is a right triangle? a+b+c=p?

It can be seen that the 12 th digit of the fractional part is 1. If d n represents the n th digit of the fractional part, find the value of the following expression. d 1 × d 10 × d 100 × d 1000 × d 10000 × d 100000 × d 1000000 problem space: < 1000,000 , because we are working with digits, not numbers, so the 1000,000 th digit is definitely < 1M test criteria: count index of digits if concatenated using the pattern method 1 Problem space is limited, we can brute force by building the concatenated list (in memory): def method_1 (): n = 1000000 marks = [ 10 ** i for i in range ( 7 )] start = end = 0 on = 1 tmp = '' while end <= n : tmp += str ( on ) start , end = end , end + len ( str ( on )) on += 1 # print on, start, end print [ tmp [ m - 1 ] for m in marks ] print reduce ( lambda x , y : x * y , [ int ( tmp [ m - 1 ]) for m in marks ]) Found a simpler presentation in discussion thread: n = \"\" . join ( map ( str , range ( 1 , 10 ** 6 ))) print reduce ( lambda x , y : x * y , map ( lambda i : int ( n [ i - 1 ]),[ 10 ** x for x in range ( 0 , 7 )])) method 2 To be smarter, we are only interested in xth when the index count crosses the 10xx th mark.

For example, 2143 is a 4-digit pandigital and is also prime. What is the largest n -digit pandigital prime that exists? problem space: 1-n exactly once → n can not exceed 9 test criteria: is prime? is pandigital? I would start with 9-digit primes that also starts with digit 9 — ''9xxxx'', and if it passes pandigital test, it is the one. However, after trial, this strategy did not work. Brute force by step of -2 is not viable due to the large number of numbers we have to test. Changing this thought a little bit, we use itertools.permutations to generate all combo which is guaranteed to be pandigital prior to testing for primality. Key observations: No 8 or 9 digit pandigital number can be prime. All of them are divisible by 3, because sum of digits is a multiple of 3. The greatest pandigital prime has to occur in amongst the 7 digit nunbers, or less. Moreover, the last digit of the pandigital number has to be odd, for it to stand a chance of being prime. from p10 import is_prime from itertools import permutations def main (): digit_count = 9 candidates = [] while digit_count > 1 : # 1-n pandigital test test = lambda x : set ( [ str ( i ) for i in range ( 1 , len ( str ( x )) + 1 )]) == set ( list ( str ( x ))) # iterate all combo for digits in permutations ( range ( 1 , digit_count + 1 ), digit_count ): # ending digit of these can be skipped if digits [ - 1 ] in [ 2 , 4 , 6 , 8 , 5 ]: continue # possible number to test n = int ( '' . join ([ str ( x ) for x in digits ])) # test criteria: is prime? is pandigital? if is_prime ( n ) and test ( n ): print 'found one' , digit_count , n candidates . append ( n ) # we could have stopped here as long as \"candidates\" is not null # any more because we are counting from 9-digits down. # Just to be thorough, we are listing all such numbers. digit_count -= 1 print max ( candidates ), len ( candidates ) problem 42 Question : The n th term of the sequence of triangle numbers is given by, t n = ½ n ( n +1); so the first ten triangle numbers are: 1, 3, 6, 10, 15, 21, 28, 36, 45, 55, ... By converting each letter in a word to a number corresponding to its alphabetical position and adding these values we form a word value. For example, the word value for SKY is 19 + 11 + 25 = 55 = t 10 . If the word value is a triangle number then we shall call the word a triangle word. Using P042 words.txt , a 16K text file containing nearly two-thousand common English words, how many are triangle words? problem space : words in the given .txt file test criteria : word's value add up to a triangle number This is pretty straightforward. Create a list of triangle numbers, then iterate through words in the text file to create their values, then match. import csv import string def main (): get_score = lambda x : sum ([ string . ascii_uppercase . find ( i ) + 1 for i in x ]) names = None with open ( 'p042_words.txt' , 'rb' ) as f : names = list ( csv . reader ( f ))[ 0 ] word_scores = dict (( n , get_score ( n )) for n in names ) triangle_numbers = [ n * ( n + 1 ) / 2 for n in range ( 1 , max ( word_scores . values ()) / 2 )] result = filter ( lambda x : word_scores [ x ] in triangle_numbers , word_scores ) print len ( result ) The only take away I could think of is to dynamically determine the upper bound to generate triangle numbers. I used max()/2 . In reality, it can be reduced further by doing sqrt(max()) . Well, I wanted to stick with basic math so did not import math.sqrt . problem 43 Question : The number, 1406357289, is a 0 to 9 pandigital number because it is made up of each of the digits 0 to 9 in some order, but it also has a rather interesting sub-string divisibility property. Let d 1 be the 1 st digit, d 2 be the 2 nd digit, and so on. In this way, we note the following: d 2 d 3 d 4 =406 is divisible by 2 d 3 d 4 d 5 =063 is divisible by 3 d 4 d 5 d 6 =635 is divisible by 5 d 5 d 6 d 7 =357 is divisible by 7 d 6 d 7 d 8 =572 is divisible by 11 d 7 d 8 d 9 =728 is divisible by 13 d 8 d 9 d 10 =289 is divisible by 17 Find the sum of all 0 to 9 pandigital numbers with this property. problem space : permutation of 0-9 → 3628800 of them test criteria : test by the sub-string divisibility property To generate problem space, we use itertools.permutations , nice and easy. To observe test criteria, we notice a couple filters to rule out some combinations (see code below). The rest are just dumb tests. import itertools def main (): # no 0 on both ends space = filter ( lambda x : x [ 0 ] and x [ - 1 ], itertools . permutations ( range ( 10 ), 10 )) # test criteria: d2d3d4 % 2 == 0 space = filter ( lambda x : x [ 3 ] % 2 == 0 , space ) # test criteria: d3d4d5 % 3 == 0 space = filter ( lambda x : ( x [ 2 ] + x [ 3 ] + x [ 4 ]) % 3 == 0 , space ) # test criteria: d4d5d6 % 5 == 0 space = filter ( lambda x : x [ 5 ] in [ 0 , 5 ], space ) # test criteria: d5d6d7 % 7 == 0 test_7 = lambda x : int ( ` . join ([ str ( x ) for x in x [ 4 : 7 ]])) % 7 == 0 # test criteria: d6d7d8 % 11 == 0 test_11 = lambda x : int ( ` . join ([ str ( x ) for x in x [ 5 : 8 ]])) % 11 == 0 # test criteria: d7d8d9 % 13 == 0 test_13 = lambda x : int ( ` . join ([ str ( x ) for x in x [ 6 : 9 ]])) % 13 == 0 # test criteria: d8d9d10 % 17 == 0 test_17 = lambda x : int ( ` . join ([ str ( x ) for x in x [ 7 : 10 ]])) % 17 == 0 # all tests test = lambda x : test_7 ( x ) and test_11 ( x ) and test_13 ( x ) and test_17 ( x ) # result print sum ([ int ( ` . join ([ str ( x ) for x in n ])) for n in filter ( test , space )]) problem 44 Question : Pentagonal numbers are generated by the formula, P n = n (3 n −1)/2. The first ten pentagonal numbers are: 1, 5, 12, 22, 35, 51, 70, 92, 117, 145, ... It can be seen that P 4 + P 7 = 22 + 70 = 92 = P 8 . However, their difference, 70 − 22 = 48, is not pentagonal. Find the pair of pentagonal numbers, P j and P k , for which their sum and difference are pentagonal and D = |P k − P j | is minimised; what is the value of D? problem space : no upper bound test criteria : a pair of pentagonal numbers, their sum and abs(diff) are also pentagonals, and search for the min(diff) This should be straightforward, creating a generator of pentagonal number, and select any 2 to run by the test criteria. However, because there is no UP, this method will be a trial and error to find a qualified pair. But even then how do we know this is minimized? method 1 (brute force) This generated correct answer, but this is luck not mathematically proven: import itertools def pentagonal_generator ( n ): m = 1 while m < n : yield m * ( 3 * m - 1 ) / 2 m += 1 def method_1 (): n = 3000 pentagonals = list ( pentagonal_generator ( n )) for a , b in itertools . combinations ( pentagonals , 2 ): if a + b in pentagonals and abs ( a - b ) in pentagonals : print 'found' , a , b , a + b , abs ( a - b ) UP started at 1000 but without finding any qualified pair, then increased to 2000 , failed again, then to 3000 , and it generated a single pair: (1560090, 7042750) , and it turned out to be the correct answer a-b = 5482660 . method 2 This one guarantees to find the minimal . The idea is simple, if a-b=c and all three are pentagonal numbers, then a=b+c . We could derive c must be in form of 3n+1 , so we first iterate through all pentagonal numbers that fits 3n+1 pattern as c , then iterate all b which must be less than c , and a=b+c and a+c=b+2c ! If both are also pentagonal numbers, we find our minimal . def method_2 (): n = 3000 pentagonals = list ( pentagonal_generator ( n )) # if a, b are two adjacent pentagonal numbers, # then a-b fits a pattern: 3n+1 diffs = filter ( lambda x : ( x - 1 ) % 3 == 0 , pentagonals ) for c in diffs : for b in filter ( lambda x : x < c , pentagonals ): if c + b in pentagonals and c + 2 * b in pentagonals : print 'found' , b , c + b , c + 2 * b , c return This one not only guarantees the minimal value, but also takes less iterations: method 1: 2,537,438 iterations method 2: 608,718 iterations, 4 times faster than method 1. problem 45 Question : Triangle, pentagonal, and hexagonal numbers are generated by the following formulae: Triangle T n = n ( n +1)/2 1, 3, 6, 10, 15, ... Pentagonal P n = n (3 n −1)/2 1, 5, 12, 22, 35, ... Hexagonal H n = n (2 n −1) 1, 6, 15, 28, 45, ... It can be verified that T 285 = P 165 = H 143 = 40755. Find the next triangle number that is also pentagonal and hexagonal. problem space : no upper bound test criteria : is triangle and is pentagonal and is hexagonal? Brute force way is to create a list of each kind of numbers, then take the set intersection. First two are 1 and 40755. We are searching for the 3rd one: from p44 import pentagonal_generator def triangle_generator ( n ): m = 1 while m < n : yield m * ( m + 1 ) / 2 m += 1 def hexagonal_generator ( n ): m = 1 while m < n : yield m * ( 2 * m - 1 ) m += 1 def main (): result = [] n = 0 while len ( result ) < 3 : n += 10000 result = set ( pentagonal_generator ( n )) & set ( triangle_generator ( n )) & set ( hexagonal_generator ( n )) print n , result After reading the discussion threads, a couple new discoveries: all hexagonal numbers are also triangle numbers, so we could skip generating triangle numbers altogehter now to make a number that is both hexgonal and pentagonal, check this out! Math is beautiful. problem 46 Question : It was proposed by Christian Goldbach that every odd composite number can be written as the sum of a prime and twice a square. 9 = 7 + 2×1 2 15 = 7 + 2×2 2 21 = 3 + 2×3 2 25 = 7 + 2×3 2 27 = 19 + 2×2 2 33 = 31 + 2×1 2 It turns out that the conjecture was false. What is the smallest odd composite that cannot be written as the sum of a prime and twice a square? problem space : no UP test criteria : logically how to test a conjecture false? ← finding one that breaks the conjecture. But not finding one (yet) does 'not ' prove it false. My approach is to generate two sets, and check whether they have interaction: set 1 : odd numbers that fit the prime+2*x*x pattern, where x is 1-N, and prime are primes below N. set 2 : consecutive odd numbers below a the same upper bound N. What's in set 2 but not in set 1 is an odd number that falsify the conjecture → then pick the minimal one. Upper bound N is by trial and error if the returned list is empty. Incremented by 1,000 per step, 6,000 will find two such numbers: 5993, 5777. from p10 import get_primes , is_prime def main (): n = 6000 num = filter ( lambda x : x % 2 , set ( [ p + 2 * x * x for x in range ( 1 , n ) for p in get_primes ( n )])) print filter ( lambda x : not is_prime ( x ), set ( range ( 3 , n , 2 )) - set ( num )) Value for n was set through trial and error ← increased until result returns a non null list. When set to 6,000, it actually found two values: 5,777 and 5,993. Never thought I would have tackled Goldbach conjecture , wow! However, original conjecture is different, so this one was made up to be false on purpose. problem 47 Question : The first two consecutive numbers to have two distinct prime factors are: 14 = 2 × 7 15 = 3 × 5 The first three consecutive numbers to have three distinct prime factors are: 644 = 2² × 7 × 23 645 = 3 × 5 × 43 646 = 2 × 17 × 19. Find the first four consecutive integers to have four distinct prime factors. What is the first of these numbers? problem space : no upper bound test criteria : 4 consecutive numbers, all have 4 distinct prime factors If a,b,c,d are consecutive, there are only two patterns possible: even, odd, even, odd odd, even, odd, even Also, at least one of the four numbers is divisible by 3. Looking at the example, my guess is the number with 4 distinct prime factors could be a 4-digit number, so let's try UP of 10,000 to begin with. Another observation: two even numbers, say a and c , are separated by 2, both would have 2 as a factor, so the product of their other 3 factors should generate two numbers with delta of 1! → find 2 pairs of three-prime whose product has delta of 1. I bet there aren't that many of such pair. from p10 import get_primes def get_prime_factors ( n , primes = []): \"\"\"Get prime factors of n.

Searching for most significant 10 digits would have been more challenging. problem 49 Question : The arithmetic sequence, 1487, 4817, 8147, in which each of the terms increases by 3330, is unusual in two ways: (i) each of the three terms are prime, and, (ii) each of the 4-digit numbers are permutations of one another. There are no arithmetic sequences made up of three 1-, 2-, or 3-digit primes, exhibiting this property, but there is one other 4-digit increasing sequence. What 12-digit number do you form by concatenating the three terms in this sequence? problem space : 4-digit number test criteria : all terms are prime are permutation of each other Such a limited problem space, simple filter by test criteria. from p10 import is_prime def main (): primes = sorted ([ x for x in range ( 1000 , 10000 ) if is_prime ( x )]) for a in primes : b = a + 3330 c = b + 3330 # test 1: are primes if b in primes and c in primes : # test 2: are permutations of each other if set ( str ( a )) == set ( str ( b )) == set ( str ( c )): print a , b , c It was not clear to me that 3 numbers had to be separated by 3,330 . So using the other two criteria would generate more than 2 sets of candidates by iterating 4-digit prime. Once this test criteria was added, there are only 2 left. 1487 4817 8147 2969 6299 9629 problem 50 Question : The prime 41, can be written as the sum of six consecutive primes: 41 = 2 + 3 + 5 + 7 + 11 + 13 This is the longest sum of consecutive primes that adds to a prime below one-hundred. The longest sum of consecutive primes below one-thousand that adds to a prime, contains 21 terms, and is equal to 953. Which prime, below one-million, can be written as the sum of the most consecutive primes? problem space : prime numbers below 1,000,000 test criteria : is prime, and is a sum of consecutive primes, and is below 1,000,000 Using a sliding window technique. First generate prime list below 1,000,000 , then set a window size to search for this prime. Since we are looking for the longest consecutive prime list that meets criteria, my thought is to start with a large window size then downsize it each step, so that the 1st encounter would be the answer. The hard part is to set the initial window size. Tried len(primes)-1 but this was very slow. Then I realized that there is no need to scan the entire list if the sum within given window is already greater than 1,000,000. This speeds up the search quite a bit. Then, this leads me to realize that I could use this same logic to set the max window to try! This dramatically cut down the searching range → from 79,497 to 547 . from p10 import get_primes def main (): n = 1000000 primes = sorted ( get_primes ( n )) # set max window size window = 1 while sum ( primes [: window ]) < n : window += 1 # moving window while window > 1 : # moving window start and end start = 0 end = start + window # move till the end of prime list while end < len ( primes ): # test: always true, is sum of primes tmp = sum ( primes [ start : end ]) # too big, skip if tmp > n : break # test: is prime, < n elif tmp < n and tmp in primes : print 'found' , window , tmp return # sliding window start += 1 end = start + window - 1 # try next window size window -= 1 problem 51 Question : By replacing the 1 st digit of the 2-digit number 3, it turns out that six of the nine possible values: 13, 23, 43, 53, 73, and 83, are all prime. By replacing the 3 rd and 4 th digits of 56 *3 with the same digit, this 5-digit number is the first example having seven primes among the ten generated numbers, yielding the family: 56003, 56113, 56333, 56443, 56663, 56773, and 56993. Consequently 56003, being the first member of this family, is the smallest prime with this property. Find the smallest prime which, by replacing part of the number (not necessarily adjacent digits) with the same digit, is part of an eight prime value family. problem space : no upper bound. we don't know how many digits these primes can have. test criteria : 8 primes, same digits get replaced by 8 numbers from 0-9. Observations: The 8 primes we are searching must have the same number of digits → searching space for each iteration is not too bad. Replacing number are 8 numbers from 0-9, but we don't know who they are. Can't be replacing the last digit ← it will generate an even number, thus falsify it being a prime. Can't be replacing single digit → it will generate number divisible by 3 → extending this, if the resulting family has 8 primes, we have to replace %3==0 number of digits. Any other number of digits will result in 3 of the 10 possible generated numbers to be divisible by 3. from p10 import get_primes def main (): for p in get_primes ( 10000000 ): if len ( str ( p )) - len ( set ( str ( p ))) >= 2 : print p problem 52 Question : It can be seen that the number, 125874, and its double, 251748, contain exactly the same digits, but in a different order. Find the smallest positive integer, x , such that 2 x , 3 x , 4 x , 5 x , and 6 x , contain the same digits. problem space : no upper bound test criteria : as stated in problem This one is easy for brute force: using set equal to determine whether they have the same digits since they contain the same number of digits also, the smallest of the set has to start with digit 1 in order for 6x to stand a chance. at least 6 digits ← multiply 2x... can generate 5 different numbers, plus 1 → 6 digits minimum. def main (): # 2x, 3x, 4x, 5x, 6x multipliers = [ 2 , 3 , 4 , 5 , 6 ] # starting point, at least 6-digit number n = 10 ** 5 # search while True : # compute 2x... tmp = [ set ( str ( n * m )) for m in multipliers ] # test: having same digits? if reduce ( set . union , tmp ) == tmp [ 0 ]: print n return # done # next one, most significant digit must be 1 if int ( str ( n )[ 0 ]) > 1 : n = 10 ** ( len ( str ( n )) + 1 ) else : n += 1 problem 53 Question : There are exactly ten ways of selecting three from five, 12345: 123, 124, 125, 134, 135, 145, 234, 235, 245, and 345 In combinatorics, we use the notation, 5 C 3 = 10. In general, n C r = n ! <span style=\"border-top:1px solid 000;\"> r !( n−r )! ,where r ≤ n , n ! = n ×( n −1)×...×3×2×1, and 0! = 1. It is not until n = 23, that a value exceeds one-million: 23 C 10 = 1144066. How many, not necessarily distinct, values of n C r , for 1 ≤ n ≤ 100, are greater than one-million? problem space : looks like limited since 1 ≤ n ≤ 100, and r ≤ n test criteria : the value is greater than 1,000,000 Key is to implement an efficient nCk function instead of using math.factorials because the latter grows too fast. Found an implementation on SO: from operator import mul # or mul=lambda x,y:x*y from fractions import Fraction def nCk ( n , k ): return int ( reduce ( mul , ( Fraction ( n - i , i + 1 ) for i in range ( k )), 1 )) The rest is easy, brute force it: 1. i must be greater than 10 2. j must be between 3 and i-2 def main (): BENCHMARK = 10 ** 6 n = 100 count = 0 for i in range ( 10 , n + 1 ): for j in range ( 3 , i - 2 ): if nCk ( i , j ) > BENCHMARK : count += 1 print count Math behind nCk is a Pascal's triangle ← using factorial for nCk computation is not necessary. Taking this a bit further, I searched benchmark vs. count to analyze how quickly this relationship will converge. To my surprise it is quite linear! problem 54 Question : In the card game poker, a hand consists of five cards and are ranked, from lowest to highest, in the following way: High Card : Highest value card. One Pair : Two cards of the same value. Two Pairs : Two different pairs. Three of a Kind : Three cards of the same value. Straight : All cards are consecutive values. Flush : All cards of the same suit. Full House : Three of a kind and a pair. Four of a Kind : Four cards of the same value. Straight Flush : All cards are consecutive values of same suit. Royal Flush : Ten, Jack, Queen, King, Ace, in same suit. The cards are valued in the order: 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, Jack, Queen, King, Ace. If two players have the same ranked hands then the rank made up of the highest value wins; for example, a pair of eights beats a pair of fives (see example 1 below). But if two ranks tie, for example, both players have a pair of queens, then highest cards in each hand are compared (see example 4 below); if the highest cards tie then the next highest cards are compared, and so on. Consider the following five hands dealt to two players: Hand Player 1 Player 2 Winner 1 5H 5C 6S 7S KD Pair of Fives 2C 3S 8S 8D TD Pair of Eights Player 2 2 5D 8C 9S JS AC Highest card Ace 2C 5C 7D 8S QH Highest card Queen Player 1 3 2D 9C AS AH AC Three Aces 3D 6D 7D TD QD Flush with Diamonds Player 2 4 4D 6S 9H QH QC Pair of Queens Highest card Nine 3D 6D 7H QD QS Pair of Queens Highest card Seven Player 1 5 2H 2D 4C 4D 4S Full House With Three Fours 3C 3D 3S 9S 9D Full House with Three Threes Player 1 The file, poker.txt , contains one-thousand random hands dealt to two players. Each line of the file contains ten cards (separated by a single space): the first five are Player 1's cards and the last five are Player 2's cards. You can assume that all hands are valid (no invalid characters or repeated cards), each player's hand is in no specific order, and in each hand there is a clear winner. How many hands does Player 1 win? problem space : poker game test criteria : play by the rules If interested in, read the probabilities , nice! I don't see this is a math problem, however. On the other hand, this is quite like solving a practical problem in life. method 1 Method 1 is elaborate.

Not all numbers produce palindromes so quickly. For example, 349 + 943 = 1292, 1292 + 2921 = 4213 4213 + 3124 = 7337 That is, 349 took three iterations to arrive at a palindrome. Although no one has proved it yet, it is thought that some numbers, like 196, never produce a palindrome. A number that never forms a palindrome through the reverse and add process is called a Lychrel number. Due to the theoretical nature of these numbers, and for the purpose of this problem, we shall assume that a number is Lychrel until proven otherwise. In addition you are given that for every number below ten-thousand, it will either (i) become a palindrome in less than fifty iterations, or, (ii) no one, with all the computing power that exists, has managed so far to map it to a palindrome. In fact, 10677 is the first number to be shown to require over fifty iterations before producing a palindrome: 4668731596684224866951378664 (53 iterations, 28-digits). Surprisingly, there are palindromic numbers that are themselves Lychrel numbers; the first example is 4994. How many Lychrel numbers are there below ten-thousand? NOTE: Wording was modified slightly on 24 April 2007 to emphasise the theoretical nature of Lychrel numbers. problem space : int < 10,000 test criteria : is not palidromic within 50 iteration → Lychrel number method 1 Implementation is straightforward since problem space is so small. The tricky part is to start searching from 1 , and also a number, even is palidromic itself, needs to take at least 1 sum before counting for the 50-iteration criteria. def method_1 (): is_palindromic = lambda x : str ( x ) == str ( x )[:: - 1 ] next_num = lambda x : x + int ( str ( x )[:: - 1 ]) MAX_ITERATION = 50 m = 1 count = 0 while m < 10000 : iter_count = 1 tmp = next_num ( m ) while iter_count < MAX_ITERATION and not is_palindromic ( tmp ): tmp = next_num ( tmp ) iter_count += 1 if iter_count == MAX_ITERATION : count += 1 m += 1 print count method 2 Found this one in discussion thread.

Despite their size, the sum of the digits in each number is only 1. Considering natural numbers of the form, a b , where a, b < 100, what is the maximum digital sum? This problem is too simple for Python since it handles large number just fine. A one liner. max ([ sum ( int ( x ) for x in str ( a ** b )) for a in range ( 1 , 101 ) for b in range ( 1 , 101 )]) problem 57 Question : It is possible to show that the square root of two can be expressed as an infinite continued fraction. √ 2 = 1 + 1/(2 + 1/(2 + 1/(2 + ... ))) = 1.414213... By expanding this for the first four iterations, we get: 1 + 1/2 = 3/2 = 1.5 1 + 1/(2 + 1/2) = 7/5 = 1.4 1 + 1/(2 + 1/(2 + 1/2)) = 17/12 = 1.41666... 1 + 1/(2 + 1/(2 + 1/(2 + 1/2))) = 41/29 = 1.41379... The next three expansions are 99/70, 239/169, and 577/408, but the eighth expansion, 1393/985, is the first example where the number of digits in the numerator exceeds the number of digits in the denominator. In the first one-thousand expansions, how many fractions contain a numerator with more digits than denominator? problem space : 1000 expansion of square root of 2 test criteria : in fraction form, numerator has more digits than denominator's method 1 Triggered by the similarity between the expansion formula and reduce built-in function, this method approached with a brute force using reduce . Note we have to use Fraction for calculations within reduce . Otherwise, it introduces a hell of floating point error which makes converting back to Fraction quite uncontrollable. For example, Fraction(17/12.0) will generate Fraction(6380099472108203, 4503599627370496) ! WTF. from fractions import Fraction def method_1 (): # nth iteration floating number form nth = lambda n : 1 + \\ Fraction ( 1 , reduce ( lambda x , y : Fraction ( 1 , x ) + y , [ 2 ] * n )) # all in fractional form frac = map ( nth , range ( 1 , 1001 )) # test: numerator has more digits result = filter ( lambda x : len ( str ( x . numerator )) > len ( str ( x . denominator )), frac ) print len ( result ) However, because of using Fraction all the way through, computation was very slow. method 2 Forget about using fractions. The math is simple enough that we don't really need that at all. Instead, keep track of numerator and denominator as we go. Love this one. def method_2 (): n , d = 1 , 2 count = 0 for i in range ( 2 , 1001 ): n , d = d , d * 2 + n # test: numerator has more digits if len ( str ( n + d )) > len ( str ( d )): count += 1 print count problem 58 Question : Starting with 1 and spiralling anticlockwise in the following way, a square spiral with side length 7 is formed. 37 36 35 34 33 32 31 38 17 16 15 14 13 30 39 18 5 4 3 12 29 40 19 6 1 2 11 28 41 20 7 8 9 10 27 42 21 22 23 24 25 26 43 44 45 46 47 48 49 It is interesting to note that the odd squares lie along the bottom right diagonal, but what is more interesting is that 8 out of the 13 numbers lying along both diagonals are prime; that is, a ratio of 8/13 ≈ 62%. If one complete new layer is wrapped around the spiral above, a square spiral with side length 9 will be formed. If this process is continued, what is the side length of the square spiral for which the ratio of primes along both diagonals first falls below 10%? problem space : no upper boundary test criteria : percentage of primes in all diagonal numbers are < 10% Building upon problem 28 , this one is easy. The only thing to watch out for is that in the problem, it is asking for the length of the resulting square. So we need to convert circle count to that → 2*m+1 . from p10 import is_prime def main (): m = 1 # m is the circle counter num = 1 # corner num prime_count = 0 while not prime_count or 4 * m + 1 <= prime_count * 10 : # compute 4 corner values for i in range ( 4 ): num += m * 2 # 2*m is the step if is_prime ( num ): prime_count += 1 # next spiral, please m += 1 print 2 * m + 1 The time was mostly consumed in primality test. Here is an article on primality testing non deterministic algorithm . However, I tried implementation of Fermat test, [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Miller%E2%80%93Rabin_primality_test Miller Rabin] test, and various python code, but performance is 3x of my problem 10 implementation. From comments, it looks like these algorithms are faster than native method when determining LARGE numbers. My test was running for all primes under 1,000,000. problem 59 Question : Each character on a computer is assigned a unique code and the preferred standard is ASCII (American Standard Code for Information Interchange).

A modern encryption method is to take a text file, convert the bytes to ASCII, then XOR each byte with a given value, taken from a secret key. The advantage with the XOR function is that using the same encryption key on the cipher text, restores the plain text; for example, 65 XOR 42 = 107, then 107 XOR 42 = 65. For unbreakable encryption, the key is the same length as the plain text message, and the key is made up of random bytes. The user would keep the encrypted message and the encryption key in different locations, and without both \"halves\", it is impossible to decrypt the message. Unfortunately, this method is impractical for most users, so the modified method is to use a password as a key. If the password is shorter than the message, which is likely, the key is repeated cyclically throughout the message. The balance for this method is using a sufficiently long password key for security, but short enough to be memorable. Your task has been made easy, as the encryption key consists of three lower case characters. Using cipher.txt (right click and 'Save Link/Target As...'), a file containing the encrypted ASCII codes, and the knowledge that the plain text must contain common English words, decrypt the message and find the sum of the ASCII values in the original text. problem space: the given cipher text and a 3-lower-case letters as password test criteria: not clear to me, but this is the key Math is not the issue here. If we could get the message right, we could easily compute the sum. But how do we know the message is correct? I don't see a hard test in this problem. Could it be so subjective that there are more than 1 answer? method 1 This approach is messy. separated given data into 3 sets → msg[::3] , msg[1::3] , msg[2::3] test ASCII value 32-127 and rule out those that will generate non-printable characters after XOR ← original text are all printable. 1st set: ['b', 'c', 'd', 'e', 'f', 'g', 'i', 'r', 'x'] 2nd set: ['a', 'h', 'j', 'k', 'l', 'm', 'n', 'o', 'p', 'z', '{'] 3rd set: [\"'\", 'd', 'e', 'f', 'g', 'j', 'q', '{'] Using these characters to decode each set, and examine for irrational results. eg. 1st using b(98) , it generates \"-\" after XOR with 79 → not likely will be the start of a word or sentence, so b will be ruled out (or at least downgraded). This technique reduced the options to: 1st set: ['g','x'] 2nd set: ['a','b','j','k','l','m','n','o','p','z','{'] 3rd set: [\"'\",'d','e','f','g','j','{'] Last, iterate through combinations(2*10*7=140) and eyeball the decoded message. I know this is not clever . But I failed to see a hard test criteria to know that decoded message is correct. method 2 This method is an improved version of method 1. Idea is the same. A test is introduced: english sentence must have the pattern. It turned out this test is SUFFICIENT to determine the result! def method_2 (): # construct 3 sets with open ( 'p059_cipher.txt' , 'r' ) as f : msg = f . read () msg = map ( int , msg . split ( ',' )) # find possibles possibles = [] for i in range ( 3 ): s = msg [ i :: 3 ] pp = [] for i in range ( 32 , 127 ): tmp = [ x &#94; i for x in s if x &#94; i not in range ( 32 , 127 )] if not tmp : pp . append ( i ) possibles . append ( pp ) # iterate for a in possibles [ 0 ]: for b in possibles [ 1 ]: for c in possibles [ 2 ]: pwd = [ a , b , c ] decoded = ` . join ( chr ( x &#94; pwd [ idx % 3 ]) for idx , x in enumerate ( msg )) # test: wow! if ' the ' in decoded : print ` . join ( chr ( x ) for x in pwd ) print decoded method 3 Some people have approached this problem using letter frequency . I will try this method later. problem 60 Question : The primes 3, 7, 109, and 673, are quite remarkable. By taking any two primes and concatenating them in any order the result will always be prime. For example, taking 7 and 109, both 7109 and 1097 are prime. The sum of these four primes, 792, represents the lowest sum for a set of four primes with this property. Find the lowest sum for a set of five primes for which any two primes concatenate to produce another prime. problem space : no upper bound test criteria : any two of the 5 primes can be concatenated to form another prime This one took me quite a while. I was completely stuck at the problem because I was chasing down the (3,7,109,673) path without realizing that there could be other 4 primes also fitting this attribute, eg. 13, 5197, 5701, 6733, and 7, 127, 6949, 7723. I googled for a hint after stuck for over a week. Without understanding his algorithm nor his code, what struck me was this line: First thing is that we can't stop once we find a solution.... With this said, my method is to keep track of ALL lists that fits the \"any two concatenated forms a prime\" test. We start with a seed list [3,7,11,13] , if we add 7 to 3, the list will now become [[3,7],3,7,11,13] . Two conditions: always leave 3,7,11,13 available for new prime to test; only append to a number that's smaller — append 7 to 3 to make [3,7], but not [7,3]. method 1 (brute force) To brute force this, the key is to generate enough prime number ( next prime ) to test. Method postponed_sieve problem 10 is to generate prime 'indefinitely '. from p10 import is_prime2 , postponed_sieve import copy def method_1 (): N = 5 # test: is concatenated a prime prepend_test = lambda p , r : is_prime2 ( int ( str ( p ) + str ( r ))) append_test = lambda p , r : is_prime2 ( int ( str ( r ) + str ( p ))) # searching seed results = [[ 3 ], [ 7 ], [ 11 ], [ 13 ]] # search through primes indefinitely tmp_min = 0 for p in postponed_sieve (): # when break here, we guarantee the \"lowest sum\" if tmp_min and p >= tmp_min : break # 2 is a special prime, skip if p == 2 : continue print '@' , p , len ( results ) # test: primality test # Use index because we will modify \"results\" list # within the loop for idx in range ( len ( results )): # flag default to True is_valid = True # check sublist tmp = results [ idx ] for r in tmp : # test: is concatenated a prime? if not prepend_test ( p , r ) or not append_test ( p , r ): is_valid = False break # passed test, update results list # if p is greater than last number on that list if is_valid and p > tmp [ - 1 ]: # save original list results . append ( copy . copy ( tmp )) # extend list that fits pattern results [ idx ] . append ( p ) if len ( results [ idx ]) == N and ( sum ( results [ idx ]) < tmp_min or tmp_min < 1 ): tmp_min = sum ( results [ idx ]) # print result found = filter ( lambda x : len ( x ) == N , results ) print found , min ( sum ( x ) for x in found ) Graph below shows that the length of candidate list grows almost linearly with the growing of primes generated. When stopped at break condition, we had two pairs: [7, 1237, 2341, 12409, 18433] [13, 5197, 5701, 6733, 8389] 2nd one had a smaller sum, 26033 . problem 61 Question : Triangle, square, pentagonal, hexagonal, heptagonal, and octagonal numbers are all figurate (polygonal) numbers and are generated by the following formulae: Triangle P 3, n = n ( n +1)/2 1, 3, 6, 10, 15, ... Square P 4, n = n 2 1, 4, 9, 16, 25, ... Pentagonal P 5, n = n (3 n −1)/2 1, 5, 12, 22, 35, ... Hexagonal P 6, n = n (2 n −1) 1, 6, 15, 28, 45, ... Heptagonal P 7, n = n (5 n −3)/2 1, 7, 18, 34, 55, ... Octagonal P 8, n = n (3 n −2) 1, 8, 21, 40, 65, ... The ordered set of three 4-digit numbers: 8128, 2882, 8281, has three interesting properties. The set is cyclic, in that the last two digits of each number is the first two digits of the next number (including the last number with the first). Each polygonal type: triangle (P 3,127 =8128), square (P 4,91 =8281), and pentagonal (P 5,44 =2882), is represented by a different number in the set. This is the only set of 4-digit numbers with this property. Find the sum of the only ordered set of six cyclic 4-digit numbers for which each polygonal type: triangle, square, pentagonal, hexagonal, heptagonal, and octagonal, is represented by a different number in the set. problem space : 4-digit numbers test criteria : is cyclic, is represented by a different number in the set Generating these polygonal number is trivial. Some have been done in previous problems: 1. problem 44 : pentagonal_generator 2. problem 45 : triangle_generator , hexagonal_generator A quick test shows how many 4-digit number in each set: [96, 68, 56, 48, 43, 40] → pick one from each set, we ended up with 30181294080 combinations → makes brute force approach impractical.","tags":"pages","url":"https://fengxia41103.github.io/myblog/project%20euler.html"},{"title":"Quote","text":"","tags":"pages","url":"https://fengxia41103.github.io/myblog/quote.html"},{"title":"Resumé","text":"Summary Full stack engineer, tech lead Designed & delivered million $ projects Git workflow & CICD expert Quick learner, analytical Have a high standard in the quality of deliverables Also available in : LinkedIn PDF Skills Programming Python Javascript Ansible C ODOO/OpenERP SQL Salesforce APEX Google app engine Git Yeoman Jira Web application Django Ansible ReactJS AngularJS jQuery Materialize Bootstrap Jinja2 Pelican Data visualization Graphviz Cytoscape.js netjsongraph.js D3plus Highchart Google chart MetricsGraphics chart.js Plotly.js dygraphs QA Selenium HP LoadRunner SonarQube Cucumber Redmine Bugzilla System design pencil & paper UML PlantUML Dia Visio System deployment Amazon EC2,RDS,S3 uWSGI Nginx Apache Builtbot Fabric System monitoring ELK stack InfluxDB Grafana Cacti Nagios System administration Salesforce RedHat Satellite RedHat RHHI Redhat Ansible Tower AWS Documentation LaTex Markdown reveal.js Confluence Org mode Word Powerpoint Excel MS Project Taskjuggler Experience Principal System Architect Lucidum 3/2022 - 3/2023 RTP, NC Laid out new architecture of the system and its development roadmap to evolve it from being on-premise only to being cloud-native.

It was so tiring over the N-1 and cutover weekend, that I start to feel my age, and my passion of working for the public sector is melting. I admire the dedication everyone put in during this period, especially for folks who I never thought would have picked up the ball and run so quickly. Without them I would not imagine the system would haven even survived! But, there were many things turned me off, also — teams who had an easy time because they had a much longer leadway into the cutover, did almost, nothing. Nothing in the sense that they simply squandered the time saved, continued to operate as if the system is already perfect and they had achieved the goal, thus simply stopped working on it. They credited themselves of the performance without realizing that they did not, I do mean they did not, create what they had! The vendor did 90% of the work, while they played along, inherited the working copy, and mistakenly thinking they had done a good job. Not surprised then that their side of the world continue to receive errors and even blockers! I'm disappointed how an engineer has no initiative to make things, perfect! Isn't the urge that makes one a good engineer!? Isn't a professionalism is like? Yet, after 1.5 years of mentorship, I would say I have failed miserably. I guess some people are simply refusing to grow. The moment it was voted going live was emotional, to me! I was tired after deprivation of sleeps the weeks before, and my nerve was tense and my expectation was high. It wasn't any surprise that the system was approved to go-live, and I felt fairly confident at that point because most of the major pieces have been in place, and the final integration, though not yet bullet-proof, has been proven, and I don't foresee much chance they won't work — after all, one needs to have faith in his own work and judgement. It's healthy to \"trust but verify\", but only to a certain point. Then, you take a leap of faith. It's like Noah going into a meet. There is not way to play the exact game twice, thus his performance can always vary from meet to meet. Yet, the trainings are the insurance, that he can only rely on that as the foundation going into the race. There isn't 100% certainty, but there must be self-confidence, trusting in the works put in, trusting the capability built-up, trusting the will to perform, and trusting the score he can achieve. First week now into the post go-live, I can feel that things are starting to calm down, and myself is having a clearer mind from sleep and order. I guess I'm really not made to make quick decisions, not that I can't, but it's super stressful to me because I always felt I don't have enough thoughts into them, and start to be frustrated and landed on other people's toes when I seek information to feed such decision. Fuse become short, and tension becomes high. Sometimes I wonder whether it's my problem or others' → I'd like to play the nice guy, but in moments like those I felt being nice is like one speaks one set of language, which, if the other party doesn't understand, guess what, s/he receives no such message, let alone the intention and reciprocal return of kindness. This isn't unique, however, in this experience, but is quite universal in many aspect of life — different prospectives, different life trajectories, different culture, different chain of reasonings.... to get someone in sync w/ you is not only a tall order, I think it's a mission impossible! But, as now in my position of work, it's rather a must-have. So, what now? Sitting here in Open Eye and writing this is such a luxury to me, that I don't have any burning issue from work to drive (though many many on the wish lists!), and my mind can start to think of things and topic like this. Sometimes when looking back in life, I found it truly fateful — fateful in the sense that in period of life, somehow I was given a way that I could not only balance the life and work and all the things, but have been continuously moving forward. How truly lucky I have been! When Noah was little, the Lenovo job gave me so much flexibility and control of my own schedule that I could take care of him regardless how crazy his agenda had been. Then now, my work is literally burying me that I have even no time for lunch almost everyday. Yet, now he is grown, having his own time and friend and thoughts and hang-outs, and my crazy schedule can still sort of work w/ his, sort of. But if mismatching ours by shifting the periods in time, I could only imagine that I would have become one of those dads in movies who missed spending time w/ kid and family due to work, and the happy ending is of him attending to kids' school show by ditching the work, thus showing what is more important in life — I'm in that mode now w/ this work, but I had spent good time w/ Noah, and I can honestly pad on my own shoulder that he has always been my priority till this job, and I haven't skipped a single time trumping his need w/ mine. I may not be a perfect dad, well, after all, this is my first time doing that, no practice, no rehearsal, some reference from my dad, but, just like my work, I need to figure things out from thin air ← a sense of achievement, but also a lost of anxiety, and undoubtedly, mistakes. We grew together, he and I. As I had wished when he was born, he is becoming a good person. What a gift! Had a chat w/ Nicole last night. Happy for her! She sent two pictures she took, what a wonderful photos! They are as cool as any of the cool shots I have watched on YouTube, absolute master pieces! This makes me think that, life as a concept is equal to everyone, we all live and die, and walk through for about that many years. Yet, what a different grades they are! — me, walking around Chapel Hill, taking photos of commercial posters on a electricity pole, and Nicole and many others travel and see the stars. Do I miss much then? If I now see the photos she took, does it make me also seeing the same view that she had experienced? and of course, she may have had a sensation while taking the photo, which I could never receive or duplicate. So her grade of life is, higher? richer? better? or just, different? I don't know. But I certainly envy the experience and the works, but it isn't a feeling of I-wish-I-had-it-too. It's just a realization I would say, a realization, or a recognition, a proof, that paths are different, some sees grand view, some sees a small town poster. It reminds me the movie, life is beautiful. Maybe there is fate to this, also. Maybe. When looking back, perhaps, in another 10,20 years, I would then recognize the plot , and understand why it must be so, either by my choice, or by, his? Oh well, I can only do this once, so, the unbearable lightness of being. Going to friend's party later today, a delayed birthday celebration, for myself. Let's take the day off, recover, recharge, re, think, re-experience, what is inside of me, what makes me happy, makes me love, makes me who I am. Enjoy the nice weather.","tags":"thoughts","url":"https://fengxia41103.github.io/myblog/post%20golive.html"},{"title":"Worcester Woman","text":"This is, suffocating! What is going on? What is happening to this country!? In this country!? By this country!? Woke up this Saturday morning, another beautiful weather, another nice, sunny day, another weekend of relaxing, driving Noah to swim, and myself taking care of some chore and catching up some work day, another openeye coffee time, mingling with a crowd, hearing the chatting noise in the background, watching the young UNC girls coming in and out studying, another life is beautiful, worth going through, at least for one more day. But, watching the video clips of this Worcester woman against this crowd of, gangsters, Gestapos, mafia, vallians, scrums of a human race, wearing a uniform, but hiding their face, and power, and shame, and humanity, and a thing, anything, that makes a human a human, behind a black mask, then pushing a woman to her arrest, overpowering her, what, 30 to 1!? 50 to 1!? one million to one!? This is not just upsetting. Yes, it makes me very very upset. But upsetting is too kind a word describing what I am watching. This is outrage, this is, crime!

If only then I could absorb this scene, and live with this so called the human race. How can this be!!? How!!?? I read before that there had been warning siren sounded in the air all along, since the founding of this country, since the first ink on the Great Charter, since the idea of Rousseau, of Martin Luther, of Kepler, of the Republic, of Socrates, of all the sages and thinkers who had led this human race penetrating the darkness of superstition, of religion, of what is of a good vs. evil, of what is right vs. wrong, of what is a society and its citizen, of what right one has vs. yield, of a contractual obligation between the governed and the governance, of what is the distinction of beauty vs. shame, of where we, this, race (I'm feeling so shamed of using this word now, just exactly who we are now!!?), are heading, should head for, and \"yes, we can do it\". But. Can we still, anymore!? Brutality, ignorance, brain-washed pure hatred, groundless assault, crowned with pleasure, pride, my duty, my job, my patriotism... really!? After, what, two hundred forty-nine years since July the 4th, 1776!? after the Common Sense of Thomas Paine!? after a World War II? after exactly eighty years from Hitler? How forgetful we all are! How shameful we all are! How ridiculous we all are! Not long ago, Brown Shirt was a badge of \"glory\" turning a person into a machine. Not long ago, White Robe was a code of fraternity turning a cult into a mafia. Not long ago, Green military dress and a small shining Red button turning a country of billion people into a mad house. Not long ago, we saw these, all of these, happened! documented! video taped! broadcasted! discussed! taugted in class to our next generations! wished they had never happened! wished they would never happen again! Then, this!? I'm not surprised at all of how a human can turn against another human w/ no sympathy, no empathy, no reservation, no mercy &mdashh human, if can be called a living form on this planet, is the worst of all animals, because, somehow, we have a brain that can be persuaded to justify any act one can dream of, any. We call ourselves moral , and determine that having it is THE difference between us and them -- cats, dogs, horses, sloths, fish, turtle... Yet, this exact word, this exact part of a person, moral, is the secret to success, by the tyrants, by the emperors, by the Himmlers, by the Lenins, Starlins, Kims, Trumps, Worcester polices, and endless such scrums yet to come. What a thin line! What a fragile defense! What a small buffer the history had constructed, with life and blood, with pure heart and belief, with tears and agonies, with vows and hope, that we would never, ever, make the same plunder again, commit the same error again, tolerate the same act again!? Yet, flood broke all dams, all banks, all sandbags, all wishes. Just like how it plays out in nature — water and fire, when standing in front of them, a building, a trench, a barrier, an individual, is, utterly, nothing. I have always awed by the power of the earthquake, the tsunami, even the seeming gentle wave caressing an ocean beach. Now I'm awed by the power of hate, of division of \"we\" against \"them\", of the power of the medieval intolerance and purge, of the power of Nationalism and its spawns, of the power of stupidity of us all, of how close we are no better than a cave man — we call them the Croods. We, are the Crood. I just realized, 2025, is marking the 30-year from my coming to this country. I remember the first week in Chicago, still jetlagged, and curious of this brave new world. Riding the harbor cruise in Chicago downtown, I couldn't yet appreciate the night scene of Chicago downtown and all what this land has to offer. I knew there is a good life, called hope, ahead of me, but had no idea what it could be. Then, Lei, looking over the side of the boat, said, \"If I ever came to here even as a tourist, I would then jump off the boat and start swimming to shore. Isn't this beautiful!?\" I couldn't understand much then. I felt surprised why he would take such an extreme measure for this — yes it's nice looking, but really? jumping off a boat for this? Then, with years living here, having family, kid, life, I had convinced myself that, scenery aside, big buildings in downtown aside, affluent society aside, there is an idea, a moral line, a everyone is equal in front of law, a we have a system in place to prevent, ban, eliminate, a king ruling w/ his free will and like. We, citizens, rule, and that's the idea, the spirit, the core ideal, the backbone of all these 80s-looking un-modern town, road, bridge, hotel, life, about, and that's the environment, the best a parent can give, to his child. I can't I have been a model citizen in any practical sense to be proud of. But I can honestly look at myself in the face when I die that I did my part, carried my share, lived by my heart, and tried the best I knew how. But now, I feel the glass castle, I should say, a sand castle, is disappearing right in front of my own eyes! What is going on!? What place will Noah have? This? This is the best I can give!? This is the best of a promise, coded in the constitution, guarded by the check and balance, pledged when we put our hands over our heart? The most recent line I picked up echos loud, 人间不值得. Indeed. With a 人间 with such an ignorance and unenlightened, we are fooling ourselves that human has progressed. We took a small step so far, and still standing at brink of an abyss, ready to fall, fast.","tags":"thoughts","url":"https://fengxia41103.github.io/myblog/worcester%20woman.html"},{"title":"Abstract","text":"Driving to see Noah's weekend swim meet past Saturday morning. I guess it was the theme of the day, that many drivers rushed overtaking me, and either found themselves waiting for at the traffic light ahead — it's either a poor timing that right after they passed me, the light tuned red, or I was slowing down cause the light is red ahead, but they still felt the urge to overtake, probably more of a statement or a vent of frustration. In any case, I found it rather humorous seeing them like a sitting duck when my car slowly approach while they got nowhere to go. This isn't new. But this time I got me thinking, that this, phenomenon, can be categorized into one of the three buckets — 眼睛不好, 脑子不好, or 运气不好. Hahaha. But then, while I was feeling proud of such philosophical summary, I wondered how true they are? I mean, are these three cover all the scenarios? Thinking of the the pyramid principle , how would I know that these three categories are sufficient? For the 眼睛不好, apparently this can be proven false (证伪), but this can't be said for the other two. Arguably you could say sort-of for the 脑子不好, which I am thinking of psychoanalysis type of diagnosis. But still, the word 脑子 is ambiguous. As for the luck , there isn't a way of proving at all except more of a fun urban legend, or a popular form of excuse, for better and for worse, indeed! Therefore, out of this smart line, 2 of the 3 are not verifiable, which then makes the credibility of this line dramatically less than what I had initially felt — quite a bogus, looks-cool-but-no-substance type of remarks (and the world is not short of these, in words and in prints). Why!? Why the line sounds both smart to my ears, but at the meantime is a BS? I wonder. The smartness can certainly impress, if not fool, somebody, right? If I hadn't taken the time to ask whether they are comprehensive, I could no have come to the realization that two of them are just vain saying. However, as I have mentioned, there are plenty of such lines around, and how many did we really a good thought whether they can survive a scrutiny? And not, then hadn't I accepted some of them at its face value and used them as if they are golden lines? Interesting. So, why I think the latter two can not be verified, 脑子不好, 运气不好? Because the nouns lack a definition , you just can't define the word 脑子, 运气, I guess I should say, you can't measure such a thing, thus making them objectively un-provable . They are, abstraction. \"Abstraction\", google said, is \"something which exists only as an idea\". In order to make a golden line ring, it must be an abstraction, a line of an idea summarized out of a general pattern of events. Can one prove an abstraction, or an idea? I suppose you can! A theory is an idea, right? then it's provable. But then why some ideas can be proven (eg. physics), and some can't (eg. religious)? I don't know. When I started writing this, I thought my conclusion was that an abstraction is inherently unprovable, but now I'm not so sure. However, in any case, an abstraction, is inherently a subjective opinion — why I pick this characteristic of these events but not that!? As cliche as it can be, 1000 ppl has 1000 version of Hamlet, thus out of the same group of events, I'm certain there can be 1000 versions of such golden lines , and mine is not smarter than yours at all, just that many people either don't come up their own Hamlet (thus taking others as the Master's saying), or not making theirs heard (often until such a conversation is engaged, in which all of a sudden one finds everyone has a version! The difference is often being that some have been brewing for a while, while others were only improvised and quickly forgotten as soon as the dinner talk ends). So back to the golden line. All these golden lines must be abstraction because that's what makes it relevant to most audience ← individual lives their own events, which are discrete by nature, your event is independent of mine, but these golden lines take the pattern out of our two events, and make them echo w/ both of us, thus we nod and say 好有道理! While saying so, we often felt we have found the core of these events — ah, so this is how they work!. But now with this article, if you have followed so far, you should now realize that these lines are, someone's summary/opinion, take or leave, they are no different than your mom says 该穿秋裤了! Like anything regarding opinion, remind yourself of independent thinking, meaning, take the one given by others w/ a grain of salt, chew on it, it's more fun to find loophole in these lines, aka. being critical, than taking it wholesale. I guess these lines are just like code, or fiction, or a shoe — quality varies substantially, some like 华为, communism, and some like John Locke , Martin Luther and his reformation, and any honest person you know in life.","tags":"thoughts","url":"https://fengxia41103.github.io/myblog/2025.html"},{"title":"Christmas eve homeless woman","text":"Walking back from the local camera store, beautiful weather. Under the sun it's feeling quite warm actually, like an early Spring. Here sit a homeless woman. I couldn't tell from afar w/o my glasses. She was sitting in the shadow on a bench outside a local auto shop. I didn't notice till she moved. Then, she and I acrossed the intersection together. I recognize her — I actually I think I saw her quite a few times on Franklin street, w/ other homeless people. I think yesterday morning outside the Open Eye I ran into her also, in the bitter morning cold, that she made a gesture as if asking for a smoke, and I said sorry I don't smoke and don't have one. Today the same gesture happened, and I answered the same way. Then while walking along I could feel she was behind me. So I turned around, and repeated that sorry I don't have anything to offer. Then, she gestured me to take a picture of her! A bit surprised, but I didn't feel so, so I declined it. While in it I started to notice that she seemed could not make a sound(!). Then, she grabbed the frog on my bag, and made like a deep gollum sound, which I couldn't tell whether she was trying to talk or just a sound. Seeing she is interested in the frog, and also I was a bit scared, I told her this is my son's, and she made a smile. I went on, saying have a nice day, and walked on. She trailed a bit further, then, in front of I was going to pass a community housing establishment, outside which sat three or four men, also homeless looking. She didn't follow any further, as if they have an agreement of territory/turf. This whole, incident, made me sad. I don't know her. Like said I have seen her before, but it never made me to think twice. I'm wondering, how much does it really take for a person, a human being like her, to fall to the bottom of a society? I had a bit fear of her, admittedly, but then, I wouldn't fear as such at all if she were a street cat or dog, I wonder. Why? Why I would not like being around a human, while I would have felt a much stronger sympathy towards a cat or dog? Isn't it because underline I had assumed that she had had a chance not to be like this? But how could I know if she was ever given such a chance? What says she was to setup to be like this since young? Why would I think dog, or cat, would then deserve a sympathy? Isn't because I assumed that it's caused by a irresponsible owner? that all dogs and cats are essentially, alike? Why? If by counting the shere variety of human being and their personalities, I think it's only logical that there are many different kinds among dogs and cats, that some are, like good human being, kind, sweet, and so on, while there are others that are, at where they are because their own doing. We assumed all animals are alike because we think they operate by so called animal instinct, which, in my mind and perhaps in many others' as well, is pretty much the same across any animal species as long as they are not human ← now to think of this, this must be a huge exaggeration, or generalization, which unlikely to be true! Dogs and cats much have variations of cat/dog-personalities just like human! Some do well, some don't. Then, does it really take much for a person to fall? or a cat/dog? There are quite a few seemingly homeless people roaming around town. I feel bad for them, especially when I saw them sitting outside in a bitter cold. Why don't they find a shelter? Is there a shelter? How do they survive, if today, tonight, then how about tomorrow? next week? How long could one last like this? I don't know, and I wonder whether myself is really that far from falling under just like that? I suppose they had family, parents, a house, a home, all those things. Yet, somehow, something happened to them that they are now living in a layer of this town that is so different from mine. I don't know why, but I really don't think it takes much to be like that. We say life is fragile, then I wonder life in the sense of a day-2-day living is also fragile, that one of something could take you down, like a rock all of sudden caught on your feet when you are peddling water in a torrent — maybe it's just like that. I don't know whether it's of their own fault that they now live like this. But I kinda doubt it. It's easy to say that they choose this way when they don't go to shelter and that. I think that's only a saying after they have fallen — more of a way to reconcile oneself w/ a harsh reality. Who doesn't want to live in comfort, w/ abundance, hot coffee, good meal, and all that? I can't forget that the woman grabbed the frog, almost like a small kid who couldn't resist the temptation when seeing sth she likes. I still don't know what she was trying to say. I feel bad for her, and for me didn't have a courage to make more conversation, or to find out what she wanted. I can't give her this frog, but next time I could offer to buy her a coffee, if that suits her need. So this is what happened on this xmas eve day, 2024. Maybe I need to learn to be more sympathetic towards another human?","tags":"thoughts","url":"https://fengxia41103.github.io/myblog/christmas%20eve%20homeless%20woman.html"},{"title":"Chinese Proverb","text":"All of sudden last night I started to realize what is wrong w/ the Chinese logics, and why Chinese language env today is so polluted with such even though they all appear to be so, correct — because the usage of proverb which has been inherited from so-acclaimed hundreds or even thousands of years of historical development, is fundamentally flawed in the sense of communication, and in particular , debate. Because it does not define a context ! Yes, it does not. Take any proverb you are familiar with, or that you have used as a roll-off-your-tongue in your recent conversation so to back up an opinion (yes, it is always used in a context of an opinion, always ), because their trademark is short (usually a 4-word phrase) and supposed concise, it has been honored as a wonderful term of capturing a large amount of info into a small body of text, and means to be shooting the arrow right on the bullseye, always. However, that's the exact the problem. With a short body of text, it provides no ramp for building the context of this phrase except of its historical background/story, which is meant to be drawn as a parallel by the listener or the speaker, to what is being talked about right now. But, by doing so, it defines, yes, I want to emphasize the word define , absolutely nothing of its appearance in the sentence. So called 只可意会不可言传, which relieves the burden of the speaker him/her-self of providing the definition, thus the clarity of its logical reasoning between point A → point B, while at the same time as an evidence to support a statement ⇆ this is the exact logical fallacy of the burden of proof ! Therefore, when everybody, and I do mean everybody, regardless of the level of education, have been acquaint with these phrases since childhood, have been using them all over the place in their daily interaction w/ this world, and the phrases themselves have been viewed as one of the crown jewels of tradition (← I do want to write about this word, \"tradition\", someday, because I feel this is such an abused word that it becomes a garbage bag of a catch-all, which again is proliferated in today's China in many aspect of its society, for example, legal, and it's really really really sad, and bizzare), such fallacy is then became a label of honor, a way of showing off, like someone's Gucci bag, a vanity tag! — so called educated , sophisticated , elite member of this society, if you could easily toss around a few of these proverbs mingled into your lines, as if it itself is a no-need-to-prove truth, so that it makes whatever the point you are making, also valid. But, I'm sorry, ladies and gentelmen, fallacy is fallacy. Period. Having a billion people doing it doesn't make a fallacy a correct logic. It only shows the deficiency of awareness of such fallacy, and the lacking of self-awareness that you look back at what you just said, trying to pull yourself out of the subjective view point, as a bystander, to listen, view, think over the same line you just said, see if there are holes in it — and 99 out of 100 of times you will find it not so robust, unfortunately (this is another topic I'd like to research more, which, as of this moment, I think it's due to the flaw of human language, that it itself lacks capability to define clarity). Therefore, the challenge in communication today, regardless the form, is that many times the definition/clarity of the word is not precise , perhaps except math symbols. We need more, context, that before an opinion is expressed, a statement is made, we need more words in front it, adj & adv, to define the scope/context/background, and in statement to make the reasoning, logical link between your evidence to your statement as clear, precise, engineering like (meaning, be factual — measurable, thus defeatible), as possible, not its opposite! These proverbs are, literacy — they convey an emotion, a thing that passed down over time to our inheritance. But they are actually, IMHO, in the same category as the Bible, or any religious scripts — they are interpretated by priest, good for some Sunday pleasures, spiritual peace and meaning-of-your-life psychology goad. So next time you use proverb, or hear one, pray is a better fitting reaction to it than applause — yes, awe its beauty, its power, its history. But you walk out a church, you still need go to your job, earn the living, eat McDonald's, beat the traffic... proverbs don't put dinner on the table, and now I hope you could see its limit, and where they actually belong — church, cult, your prayer, and that's about it.","tags":"thoughts","url":"https://fengxia41103.github.io/myblog/chinese%20proverb.html"},{"title":"No logic","text":"Long time no see. The escalating violence happening in the piece of land is prompting me to write something. Also, a very tiring week, somehow, even though work went well, made a presentation of Gen AI to the CIO crowd and all the captains on the ship, and I suppose it was received well, thus it's really a good start of my day in this org. But towards the end of Friday, I felt my entire system was slowing down, and I was even too tired to play the phone. Maybe it's just a relaxing time after a highly focused session, like a running train on sprint, that needs a break to rest. So this morning, all I want to do is to sit in OpenEye and dump brain, on the events that is happening, that, from any way I could think of, is a rare black-and-white one, thus should have had a pretty straightforward expectation of people's reaction. Yet, reading replies on Zhihu yesterday totally made me wonder, how my such maybe naive view of human being, or to be more specific, of the subset of human being living on that land, governed by that team, could be so off!? It is no secret that the so called -ism is living on fostering nothing but hatred, that it feeds off a sentiment of humiliation → agony → revenge. The script they have in mind is essentially of a slave turning to a master. Not that this is incorrect, as many Hollywood movies of motivating kind speak of the same line. But somehow, these -ism ones are, different! What is it? It's like a code smell, it's more of a feel, by experience, that it is not a good idea, and in this case, it's rather a bad one. I like a recent word, 解构, that to analyze and destruct a complex (and many times the complexity is just seemingly so) concept into a digestable structure/framework/components so that one gets to comprehend, in my engineering term, what is under the hood (while typing the word \"hood\", just reminded me the little red riding hood , in which what is under the hood!? a wolf!!!). And not surprisingly, well, I should actually say, surprisingly, when you start 解构, very likely you ended up finding a wolf under the hood, and it's exactly the case in today's China, a wolf. Its wolf warrior diplomats have been roaming around the world stage, howling and hissing for a while now. Funded by the fostered hatred over the ages of prosperity, which, by a common sense, should have been cultivated the population towards an urge to improve, to be learned, to be empathetic, to be intelligent of telling good vs. bad, right vs. wrong, to be yearning for more of the goods which they have just felt the benefits, to be wanting in company of those who have the attributes, to be disgusted by those who weighs behinds... yet, surprise! Here is this 14B people, enjoying all the benefits of the human civilization and inguity, turned against the root of all these exact same benefits — that of collaboration, learning from each other, being grateful for the giants when we stand on their shoulders, and being humble w/ our own limitation, ignorance, likelyhood of being in fault, and tolerance of difference. This is a pure ironic ! And this is getting me very much curious. How could one, already been through the disaster of the exact behavior or idea that it will bring, thus knowing all too well what is at the other end of the tunnel, yet choose just again of the same wine given that it is a new bottle this time. Isn't this, stupid, or what!? I can't even be sure that the word stupidity is a proper word to describe this. This is nearly a pure insantity! This is literally the definition of one whose mind has gong insane, that the common sense and common logic don't apply anymore, that one is seeking out for harm as if they were pleasure. Back in time religious believers did the same thing to themselves, backed by their, belief. Now fast forward 1000 years, I'm witnessing the same effect, but not sure what belief that is!? Or, if it were a belief, then I really don't think it's a good one. I hold that myself has no position to judge anyone's belief, whatever it may be, but at the mean time, myself is entitled to hold my own belief/judgement, also, and I think what they are believing is a complete nonsense! Killing a 10-year old boy, a random kid on the street, is a crime. Period. There isn't much in life that is black & white, and this one, is. Period. Forget about wiggling out of this one. Even if the person is medically insane, what was done was, wrong . Reasoning this that root of the crime is a historical grudge (and btw, not even a personal one, but a broad stoke of a nation-2-nation, race-2-race) is a complete nonsense because, the act of reasoning must build a logic chain of causal relationships, and being causal is not an easy task! Of course you can claim anything \"causal\" in your coffee chat, that of a butterfly effect, that of 子非鱼 焉知鱼之乐 kind of defense. But, that's just the fun of it. If you do indeed take such defense seriously, you are already done — because such line is nothing but a 话术, or my word, arguing for arguing's sake ← This is not reasoning. This is a statement — that you just want to win. Therefore, what they are doing is dressing up the true intention of winning under a hood of reasoning → they want to appear they are, \"reasonable\", but they themselve have no idea of reasoning, no intention to reason, and no sense of such contradict. Like a cave man, or the babies, insensitive to pain, not because they are strong, but because they are too dumb to understand. And this, is what is happening. Incredible, isn't it? That with all the modern technology in everyone's life, all the knowledge and info you could easy get w/ your phone, which, again ironically, everyone there is holding on and cheering about as their life line, someone could be in such a mental state. I don't get it. There have been fables, stories, proverbs, all of these, that roll off everyone's tongue as if they are the wisdom, the smart lines. And yet, if only one is willing to pause, and look at what oneself has just said, just done, just applauded for, one will be shocked, that what you just jeered at 2 seconds ago, are being done by yourself right now! The response of 为什么说对不起 when you were not the killer, is a great example of this — the same rational goes years back that不 是你撞的为什么要扶, which essentially derives to 事不关己高高挂起. Well, great! If the replier, you, does indeed stand by this, then pls put your finger prints here, because then I will continue the logical reasoning to show where this line will lead you to. Do you dare!? Let's start where, actually anywhere will do. Once this is your life belief, the none-of-my-biz logic above, any harm bestowed on you will lose any ground for you to complain, because the bestowers are strangers to you, and by following your line, they feel no shame, no guilt, no remorse, and no need . You got cut off in traffic? too bad. You want to return sth w/ a receipt? no way.... cause as soon as everyone is for him/her-self mode is turned on, this so called society is done! There is not group, no association, no community, no bond, no trust, no reliance, anymore. This is not the personal-freedom mode you may mistakenly think of ← this is the jungle mode 1.0, even before wolfs hunt packs → this is the time when wolf will eat wolf. Do you still dare!? I can be sure they don't have the brain capacity to derive this far. Thus everything I just painted is nothing but a huh to them. However, that's the one and only thing that human shines above all other living being on this planet so far, that of the power of reasoning so that you could guess what it can be, that there is a wall on this path, without having to run into the wall first! Now they are just giving this all up, the only worthy trait a human has as a life form has! I guess this is the case in point of 被仇恨蒙蔽双眼. I don't know who is the God of Hatred. Whoever that is will be pretty happy right now, cause, by the latest count of 8.2B people on earth, 17.07% of them are your followers. I don't know where there is also grade of smart vs. dumb in the world of hatred, I would guess there must be, it's the universal law, that within any group/team, 20% are the ones who carry 80% of the load, the remains are just 猪队友, dead weight, that drags the team down. Well, there you go, mr. God, not sure the quality of your teammates here, and for the 20% elites, good luck , cause a combination of hate+stupidity is a pretty sure recipe for something unpleasant, and being close to them is, in my common sense, or should I say in my sincere suggestion, not a good idea.","tags":"thoughts","url":"https://fengxia41103.github.io/myblog/no%20logic.html"},{"title":"51","text":"Came back from party. Met w/ good friends for some food and card. Towards the end I just snapped. I don't know why I got so tipped off by the saying. Maybe it's the \"I don't care\", which sounds to me always like a BS, because this exact same words can be applied mutually, if it has any validity. Isn't that we could all say the same thing to each other, if we don't wish things to work out? Therefore, I don't see any value in this line except as nothing but a moral high ground in an argument in order to win. I don't know. Noah's mom said the same thing before, while she was frustrated and was trying to find a way of comfort. She said the only way she found not get hurt by me was to tell herself not to care. I couldn't understand this at all at that time. Now over these years I start to apply this line in my own life, and is certainly useful to deflect many unpleasant thing or people — just tell myself I don't care, then that doesn't hurt as much any more. But again. What is this? This line always feels like a selfish choice, or a self-defence choice, when I have nothing to offer anymore, when I don't want to think for others anymore but for myself. Then I retreat into my own shell, shut the door, and tell myself they are not worth my caring anymore. This seems to be more of a strategy for the weak, but not of a wise, and certainly not of a strong. Maybe secretly I wish myself to be strong, to be brave, to have a gut to stand up, thus don't like the line and its tone. Maybe I'm frustrated not of the friend who said this, nor of the line itself even, but of myself, of an image of self which I am not achieving, and perhaps never will achieve. I recall first time hearing this from the college buddy who is a Shanghai native, that 关你屁事 关我屁事. I found it puzzling, rude, and laughable. Yet, years later now, I would almost say that my advice to anyone would, and should, only be this phrase — 关你屁 事 关我屁事 — this sums it all, of the entirety of life and this world, of its complication, of its puzzling way of running, of how one could ever navigate through its course without feeling destroyed by emotion, without being lost, and without being bullied by its unfairness and its seemingly always backwards reward issues in which the kind, the lovely, the beauty, the innocent are taken advantage of by the dishonest, the selfish, the manipulative, the rude, the unkind, the cold heart, the seekers of benefit, and the thief of the heart. But. If this is the only defence I could have, I still feel painful to exercise this however effective and protective it might be. When I can't feel the pain, what of me left anymore? If there is no judge and feeling of right and wrong, what's of a reference to act, everyday? If there isn't an emotion of joy, love, pity, disgust, disappointment, betrayal, desire, wish to have but had not, wish to gain but had not, wish to help but had not, then, what's of me, anymore? I don't know. Sometimes I think these are the same as bravery, that you choose to suffer so that u know the nerve is working, to be unhappy so that u know u can feel happy, to be torn by emotion so that u know u can still love, care... but sometimes I also think they are pretty pointless in practice sense, that suffer isn't to make you stronger but weaker, unhappiness isn't to make you more sensitive but more dull, emotion isn't to make you interesting but unwise, like tonight's. I don't know. I feel very sorry the other friends had to go through this which I created. Even when the motivation was to make everyone happy, I ended up taking an act that makes everyone the opposite. Ironical, isn't it!? I don't know. Should I have commented it, or not?

Went to the balcony after gym, and saw a gathering of some sort at the church across street. Perfect to try some photography! Was thinking to take Zf for a walk, but still felt to take the Df instead. A small section of the street was blocked by four policy cars, two on each side. People were having their fun, food was served, DJ was playing loud music. By the time I was walking across they were inviting people to dance. Then by the time I walked around town and came back passing this same spot, crowd had all gone home, stage was cleared, and only some were putting stuff away, and a stack of folding chairs standing there ready to be picked up. I wouldn't have given it much thought if not because that earlier on this walk I ran into a camp by chance, a camp of protesters on a lawn on campus. Signs were put up says Gaza . Tents flattened like a piece of floor mat lying on the ground everywhere. A couple young kids were drawing using chalks on the brick walk which cut across the camp, dividing it to two sides. Along this walk was a row of tables with people standing behind. Turned out they were serving out food, drinks, and I guess other necessities. More supplies seemed brought in, and a group of them were sitting on the ground drawing or writing something on a carboard size sign materials — the word \"genocide\" was, everywhere, \"divest\", \"no university\", \"stop\", \"13,800 ppl have been killed\", one kid dies every 10 min (or second?).... I don't know. I was surprised that they were there, many looked, and by the words on the sign referring to the \"school\", \"UNC\", \"university\", I took many of them are UNC students. But why? I don't understand. I heard on youtube yesterday that American colleges are seeing escalation of this protest against Isreal w/ the quote-&-quote \"genocide\". But I don't get this. Didn't they see the beginning of all this, that Hamas raided that music festival, killing, raping, shot on video, showed off to the world, as if they were on a celebration!? So, what do they expect? Just walks away from all these, crimes, crimes against humanity, crimes against the very word peace that these protesters are using, crimes against their own family, friends, neighbours, classmates, strangers who share the same living space so called Gaza. How could these students fold their eyes on this? Is Isreal really over-reacting when Hamas built their bunkers, tunnels, camouflaged using a hospital, a school? Can the people who works there claim innocent that they didn't know? If they did know, what else do they think will happen? They are innocent in the sense of action, but not in the sense of knowing, and in the end, tolerating. Gaza and its residents tolerated the existence of this extreme group, and some of them even supported it, participated it, and carried out its command. They are the minority, alright. But the crime of silence is real, it kills, and it killed. This is exact the thing that these protesters are voicing — that they are not tolerating the violence Isreal is showing. And this, should be the role model for Gaza! Raise your voice, act, if you indeed don't like Hamas, then, say it. And if you don't, then, well. The students got this all reversed. It's not about the Isreal being right or wrong. Rather, their exact protest is the lesson they should be giving to Gaza — the way of support Gaza, if they sincerely believe this, is to ask Gaza people to say what they truly feel — if they look at Hamas the same way I do, then, silence is not the right thing to do. Find a piece of lawn. Put up a sign, just like these students are doing. But. If these people indeed think the Hamas is a good egg. Well, then I think this camp on campus, with all its goodwill, is a hypocrisy on display.","tags":"thoughts","url":"https://fengxia41103.github.io/myblog/protest%20isreal.html"},{"title":"How many farewell","text":"How many farewell one say in a life? With growing age, I found farewell harder and harder to bear. I remember the time when I saw mom crying over a TV scene, and couldn't understand why she was so. I always thought it's just because, women are all like that — sensitive, sentimental, cry over any little things that provokes their feelings. But. Now at the age, watching yet another TV scene of a Japanese drama, the kid leaving home to Tokyo w/ big dreams and big future, it suddenly hit me that, didn't the same happen to me when I was at the airport waiting for my very first flight in life on my way to Ohio? I felt excited, nervous, happy, and very little sadness. Yet, mom, dad... now I start to understand how they had felt then. If fast forwarding for two years, when Noah is to leave for college, I can see that now, I can see myself standing there, watching him leave, flying out of the nest, w/ his big dream, his future, his life, but I would feel so sad. I truely wonder, how many farewell one could say in life? how many one could bear in life? Didn't I say it to her then, wishing a life to unfold in front of her, just life I will be saying to Noah soon, so to remove myself from their path to adventure, to enjoy, and perhaps, to suffer? When young, I never thought twice saying farewell — it felt, light, insignificant, inconsequential, almost bogus, cause we usually had plenty chances after to meet, to see each other. So a farewell felt rather like a formality that a young kid is trying to mimic an adult, yet knowing nothing of its weight. But now, each farewell feels, heart wrenching, for I learned, a farewell carries so much hope, so much bless, so much wishful joy, for the one departing, and so much sadness to cary, for the one staying. Farewell. Farewell. Maybe there is a fix count of farewells one can say, each, once said, depletes a part of oneself, till no more. But sometimes, I felt, one can be allocated too many, that s/he has to carry that, with each farewell, like a cut, bleeds. It's a bless you have so many friends, family, ppl you care, who accompany you for long and for short in life. What you pay as the price, is the pain, the tear, the sense of loss, the sadness, a deep sigh.","tags":"thoughts","url":"https://fengxia41103.github.io/myblog/how%20many%20farewell.html"},{"title":"Cold Winter Night","text":"First photo of the Earth taken by NASA in 1968 Sitting in the dark and listening to these music, watching the night outside the window, flashing nights on the building far away, a few cars running on the road at this hour, a cold cold winter night. I miss dad & Lei, miss 猪娃娃, miss the days in Shenzhen, miss the time of laughing, of talking, of coffeeing early in the morning, of playing arcades, of window shopping, of watching the water fountain dancing w/ the music, of the crowd around, of the chess game at Nanshan, sitting on bench watching the city below, of thinking of days passed, of the people missed, of the life ahead, of the time behind. What a journey a life is! I don't know how to tread this path well, or better, or worse, each step seems permanent, uncertain at best, hardly there were a few moments in life when I knew exactly what to do next — like going home to put dad to rest. And even then, these moments were always linked to something, sad. For the rest of life, it's just taking each step w/ a roll of dice, sometimes lucky, sometimes not, like dancing on a thin ice, feeling to sink at any moment, yet coasted along when the ground magically held. Fate, destiny, God's will. Nothing is in my control, yet I have to play the main role as if I could decide the script. How strange. Dad would like this music. She would, too. Zhu would not care much. But I do. How I wish the living things I care about could be all nearby, that I could see, could hear, could feel the warmth of their body, feel the life inside them.. yet, one by one, they have left my life, leaving me in this cold winter night, all alone. Though there are so much I want to say and talk about, there is only the dark night outside the window, pretty to look at, lights flashing on the building far away. What's the purpose of this life? any? I don't know. I will miss the music, if I were now on a death bed. I will miss the beautiful beings, a cat, a flower, a cloud, a sunset, a song, a smile, a coffee w/ friend, w/ one I love, a walk in Tokyo, a ride in train, a moment in a temple, a visit to the Fine Arts, a bike ride on the Charles... these are beauties in this world, they, make this journey worth coming. Suddenly thought of the college days. Felt so far away, yet, the young man is right here, in front of my eyes, how did he get to, here? How did he become, the me, right here, now? What did he do over these years, and how did he do? It's flashing by like a movie, seems something had been captured, and replayed, but there is nothing there, maybe a wish? Barely anything left. The past, forever, passed. This movie has not yet stopped, and can't roll back. What's next? I don't know. How will this movie end? It's not that interesting at all. Music flows by.

Cool weather, 60s, quite comfortable. Cloud gathering, but the sunset are still shining through cracks here and there. Listening to this youtube , Nagoya, the temple which I wondered into in 2016. All of sudden the memory dragged me back into time, 2016, the year I still had a home in Shanghai, with you near by. Today's your birthday. Happy birthday, 美 丽的人, as always, wish the best to you, for having a good time in life, wherever you are, whatever you do, and whomever you are with. 2023 has been, a year of closure. With settling Dad in April, I finally felt I could let go a weight on my mind, not that I had wished his passing, but that I had finally made the trip home, to take care of him. I hope what I did, the trip to Nanjing, the simple session that only our closest family attended, would have been the way he wanted to, to leave this world, finally. Like Coco, he is still remembered, at least by me, so he is not yet vanishing, just that he is now living in a different place, hopefully a better one than this version of the world. The music is touching. I remember the night I wondered back to the temple, watching the sky, watching the people walking by, thinking of my life and you, thinking of what was ahead of me... nothing could have prepared me for the following years. From time to time I so regret I let go your hand. But then, I reminded myself that even though company would have been what I should have given you, letting you fly is a better way, you are so young, so beautiful, so full of possibilities, tied down with an old guy like me would have been selfish. I would have had a good time, but in the end, you would shoulder much of the burden I have had, and would possibly have in the future, too. And to the end, I myself would become a burden to you. I don't want it. I don't want to be a weight on you. Go fly, enjoy. Life is a journey. Though I know the journey is tough and unpleasant, but taking away the chance to experience it would be too selfish a thing for me to do. When you are tired, beaten by life perhaps, want a way out, here this place would be, a hide-out, that you would be able to hide from this world, having all the comfort still, but could be alone, by yourself, and like what I am doing right now, sitting on this porch, watching the sky change, watching the cloud gathering, watching the sunrise and sunset, and do you know that sunsets around your birthday are always, always, so breathtaking!? I always feel it's a sign, a destiny, that you were born at this time of the year, that the evening has the best hue, just like you, being the most beautiful in this world. So it is, meant to be. Happy birthday. Starting a new job on Monday. It feel that a chapter of my life is being closed. Not that the new job would be that much different from what I have had all along. But now with Dad passed away, myself moving into a new job, I feel the age of 50 a beginning of some sort of life. I don't know what lies ahead of me. Actually I don't even have much thought or hope that how old I could eventually become. Maybe it's truly a sign of depression, that I feel I could leave this world at any moment. Like the podcase I listened, I don't regret coming into this world, I had my fun. But I don't mind leaving now, either. It's enough. I don't want to experience more, pain or merry, I have seen them. I have loved, have lost my heart and my soul, have known what a beauty is, what a kindness is, what all the good things this world could offer are like. That's good enough for me. I may feel worried about Noah, or any life of whom I may feel I could still offer something, but in the end I know I did the best I know how. I won't be able to accompany them till the end, so they will be on their own, eventually. I wish all the best luck, as I am wishing for you, and thank you for coming to my life!

I have see way too many blogs and articles and SO posts, each having a specific example of a sort, but none talks about it systematically . So this article is an attempt to consolidate the information as part of my own study notes, and provide a clear understanding of how to use these redirects in nginx. Overview First of all, there are 5 directives who will cause a redirect: index , try_files , error_page , return , rewrite . Second, there are two types of redirect — internal & external. Internal redirect will cause nginx to re-evaluate location block, and browser is not involved. An external redirect is to send a HTTP code w/ target URL back to the browser, and it's up to the browser's behavior to decide what to happen next. Below shows the five directives and their capabilities in term of internal and external redirect: http redirect code For external redirect, the response will be sent to the browser, thus it's up to the implementation of the browser to react based on the http status code. There are some subtle differences of these code. Code Name Description 301 Moved Permanently A browser redirects to the new URL and search engines update their links to the resource. 302 Found A browser redirects to this page but search engines don't update their links to the resource. 303 See Other Redirects don't link to the requested resource itself, but to another page. Always return GET . 307 Temporary Redirect Same as 302 except request method & body is not altered. 308 Permanent Redirect Same as 301 except request method & body is not altered. internal limit You will write a redirect loop at some point. Nginx has a safe-guard. There is a limit of 10 internal redirects per request to prevent request processing cycles that can occur in incorrect configurations. If this limit is reached, the error 500 (Internal Server Error) is returned. In such cases, the \"rewrite or internal redirection cycle\" message can be seen in the error log. Ref: source index Index is probably one of the oldest Internet concept. I remember my very first webpage was an index.html in a web server folder. Note that redirect by index is only applicable when we serve a request w/ ending slash . Index is referring to a file in the root directory, eg. index.html , but could be any file name designated as you wish. Serving index is only applicable to request ending with the slash character (‘/'). This is critical in redirect loop! Index always triggers an internal redirect, so location match are evaluated twice . index modules There are three nginx modules that will serve a form of an index: ngx_http_index_module : Defined as index <filename 1> <filename 2> ... . When matched location has trailing slash, index is evaluated in order: If the file is found, redirect to $uri/<index file> ; If none is found, redirect to $uri/<last index value> . ngx_http_autoindex_module : Defined as autoindex on . It returns all contents of the doc root. ngx_http_random_index_module : Defined as random_index on . It picks a random file in the doc root to serve. index definition Location can inherit and override index. ```[1-2,5] root /var/www/me; index index-A.html; location /path/a/ {} location /path/b/ {index index-B.html} You can define multiple values, and their **existence** will be tested in sequence. If it exists, a redirect as `$uri/<index filename>` will be issued, which then cause a new round of location match. index index.$geo.html index.0.html /index.html; ## index redirect root /var/www/A; index index-A.html; location = / {} location / {alias /home/feng;} A request to `http://blah.com/` will : 1. Match `= /` first because the ** exact ** takes precedence in location matching . 2. We are now in the 1st location block . Nginx tests existence of `/var/www/A/index-A.html` . If it exists , it issues a ** redirect ** to `/index-A.html` , thus triggering another location match . 3. This time it will match the ** 2nd block , processed the URI as `/index-A.html` ** . Since the URI is not ending w / slash this time , index is not evaluated anymore . File `/home/feng/index-A.html` will be returned , or 404 if doesn 't exist. # `try_files` location / { try_files /system/maintenance.html $uri $uri/ $uri/index.html $uri.html @mongrel; } ``` Internal redirect only ( doc ). Multiple values can be tested using white-space as delimiter. The last uri value will be the redirect target if all tests fail. Value Example Test hardcoded filename /system/maintenance.html Existence of this file in doc root by root or alias filename w/ variable $uri, $uri/me.html, $myname-this.html Existence of file w/ ending slash $uri/ Existence of directory named location @blah Existence of a named location block =[code|named] =404, =@django Can only be the last test , catch-all redirect error_page official doc . Both internal and external. If you redirect to a named location, a proxy could take cover to continue the process, and it may have its own error handling strategy. Example Effect error_page 404 /404.html; Redirect to /404.html for 404 error code. error_page 500 502 503 504 /50x.html; Combine error handling to a single uri redirect. error_page 404 =200 /empty.gif; Return status 200 instead of 404. Can map multiple to one. error_page 404 = @fallback; Proxy determines what to be returned. URI is passed on as-is. error_page 404 =301 http://...; Redirect to another URL. Default to 302. Can map to 301, 302, 303, 307, and 308 only. return Will terminate any further processing, and send a response to the browser ( doc ). Thus it's usually define the full URL for the target. If it's using only a uri such as /photos , the full URL will be composed by Nginx based on a couple other directive values. Example Context Effect return 301 $scheme://www.newdomain.com$request_uri; Server Redirect all requests to a new domain return 301 $scheme://blah.com/here; Location Redirect to new URL return 301 /photos; Location Redirect to a URI return [http|https|$scheme]://blah.com/... Location Imply code 302 rewrite Rewrite is the most flexible one since it uses regex. Behavior is determined by the flag ( doc ). Flag Context Return Code Effect last Server n/a Internal redirect. Start new location match. break Location n/a Skip other rewrite in this Location context. redirect n/a 302 Any replacement not starting w/ [http|https|$scheme] permanent n/a 301","tags":"dev","url":"https://fengxia41103.github.io/myblog/nginx%20redirect.html"},{"title":"Django Permission, DRF, OAuth2","text":"OAuth2 is confusing! Here I'm gonna use Django as the framework to how OAuth2 can be implemented. This shall provide a reference point for others to see how OAuth2 is meant to work. who is who is who I'm gonna use layman's term instead of the RFC . Who Description You The user who has a user account w/ Authorization Server. Application For example, my Stock app. You are delegating this app on your behalf to access resources, thus the \"Grant\". Resource Server For example, Gmail is a resource server for my emails, GDrive is another for my drives, etc. Authorization Server Google as a whole is an Authorization Server. I authenticate w/ google.com . Same for GitHub, FB, etc. OAuth2 is & is-not Read RFC . Some points not clear from the RFC, but are important: It's a protocol . In other words it describes a way to negotiate authorization, but doesn't care implementation details, eg. each framework/language has a dozen different implementations, all vary at details but follow the same requirements defined in RFC. This RFC dictates a very specific sequence of call flow/workflow , and it dictates some restrictions, eg. client secret should never be made available to the frontend/browser. Authorization Server is the source-of-truth for user . This is very important. OAuth2 is meant to allow a user to access multiple applications while these applications don't have any data/table of user records! In other words, in today's micro service world, if I have two services and each service is a Django app, I don't want to maintain two separate user name called fengxia in two DBs. Instead, I create 3rd Django app/service just to manage user, and this Django app is also the OAuth2 Authorization Server. Resource Server can be separate from Authorization Server . If thinking of micro service architecture, this is pretty obvious. Individual service is the resource server, and there will be one Authorization Server vs. multiple resource servers. In this case you need to implement OAuth2 Introspection on the Authorization Server (see later) so that resource server could obtain more information of the user by querying this token, and then use the user's whatever information for its own purpose. If letting ppl use social media account to login your own app, it's OAuth2 . Say you created the Stock app, how to entice ppl to use it? Instead of asking ppl to register w/ your app, you let them login using their Google credential. This, is OAuth2. In this case, Google is the Authorization Server. You will be granting the Stock app a read scope of the user resource, for example, thus now the Stock app can get your name, phone, email, and save them in the Stock's DB, the Stock app can render a HTML template w/ Hello, {{ user.name }} . You will also save the token in Stock's DB, eg. a field in User model, because all subsequent calls to Google uses this token. You must register application w/ Authorization Server . If you Stock app is not the Authorization Server, and the Authorization Server has something(aka. resource) your want, register your application w/ the Authorization Server. This is defined in the protocol , and must be done . OAuth2 workflow OAuth2 scope It's super confusing what OAuth2 scope is . First, scope is just string. The Authorization Server could define any scope it wants. The value of the scope parameter is expressed as a list of space- delimited, case-sensitive strings. The strings are defined by the authorization server. If the value contains multiple space-delimited strings, their order does not matter, and each string adds an additional access range to the requested scope. Second, it's definition isn't completely arbitrary . Because Authorization Server is using scope to control access to registered application and its resources, it only makes sense that the scope string means something about the access control * of the resource. Therefore, naming a scope is rather like naming a variable ← there is certain best practice involved. And this is where Django comes in. For following discussion, we are talking about a Resource Server implemented in Django & DRF . Scope can bypass permission OAuth2 only cares scope. Whether the scope is enforcing a permission is determined by implementation. Since scope is arbitrary string, there is nothing preventing an API assigned a scope called \"feng\", and returns a queryset of sensitive data even though the requesting user John has no permission on this data. What influence the exact behavior in this scenario also depends on: the default DRF permission in the settings.py : ```python # settings.py REST_FRAMEWORK = { 'DEFAULT_PERMISSION_CLASSES': [ 'rest_framework.permissions.IsAuthenticated', <== default ] } ``` In this case, John must be authenticated and has the \"feng\" scope. Since OAuth2 always requires authentication, so this is a given. However, DRF has a list of other built-in permissions, and some would tie into model permission, which then enforce a permission on top of scope. and permission_classes= per DRF view: ``` python # views.py from guardian.shortcuts import assign_perm from rest_framework import viewsets from rest_framework.permissions import DjangoObjectPermissions from .models import Message class MessageViewSet ( viewsets . ModelViewSet ): permission_classes = [ .... ] <== logical AND ``` Besides the default above, each view can have a list, which is a logical AND. Only when user has all the permissions will he be allowed access to the view/API. This is essentially the mechanism how django-oauth-toolkit checks its scope together w/ other DRF permissions. Scope & permission work together Permission is the foundation of ACL. Really depending on the framework and implementation, there are different level of security you could enforce. Ideally the underline permission is directly translated into scope . In Django's world, this is what it looks like: Django model CRUD permissions are created whenever a model is created. So you get blog.view_post permission for free, which means you could easily use the string blog.view_post as a scope &lrar a 1:1 mapping! But, each model generates 4 permissions by default, thus using them directly as scope is too tedious. Instead, you can define two general scopes called READ and WRITE , and add some custom scope, say music , to protect all the music-related APIs. In ` settings . py ` by django - auth - toolkit : OAUTH2_PROVIDER = { 'SCOPES' : { 'read' : 'Read scope' , <== GET , HEAD , OPTIONS 'write' : 'Write scope' , <== POST , PUT , PATCH , DELETE 'music' : 'Music scope' <== arbitrary }, 'CLIENT_ID_GENERATOR_CLASS' : 'oauth2_provider.generators.ClientIdGenerator' , } Then in a DRF view : class SongView ( views . APIView ): authentication_classes = [ OAuth2Authentication ] permission_classes = [ TokenHasScope , DjangoModelPermissions ] <== work together ! required_scopes = [ 'music' ] publish scope Let's say once you design a list of scopes, you provide them as document so client of your Authorization Server knows what to expect, for example, Google scopes . Django & DRF permission Since the idea of \"scope\" is to control access to resource , and a resource is an API/URL (essentially a view whether DRF-ed or not), it'd better be coherent w/ Django's access control — Permission . In other words, Django's fundamental resource are those data and data models. Accessing these data are controlled by the Permission . Therefore, these permissions must be the foundation to define a \"scope\". And they are. Permissions A couple really good articles about Django permissions, here & here . They have good code examples of how to define and enforce. To define a permission: Per Django DRF Arbitrary permission Permission.objects.create() , then link to User/Group n/a Object/row/data record django-guardian , django-rules DjangoObjectPermissions Model Any Django Model: C(add), R(view), U(change), D(delete) DjangoModelPermissions Model custom permission Model's Meta : any permission you design n/a View custom permission n/a extend BasePermission To enforce a permission: Per Django DRF Group 1:n to permissions via Admin console User 1:n to permissions via Admin console, can inherit Group's directly DRF Permissions Enforcement @ View PermissionRequiredMixin , UserPassesTestMixin , @permission_required permission_classes , @permission_classes Enforce @ Template {% if perms.blog.view_post %} , user.has_perm(\"blog.view_post\") n/a Authenticated (Group, Role) vs. Anonymous If you are anonymous, ACL is depending on whether the view is protected using an enforcement. If you are authenticated, we know the User and his Group , thus the permission is enforced by what's assigned to the User or his Group . Django does not have \"role\" . Django uses Group to group user, and permission can be attached to Group so to be applied batchly to all users in this group. Role, if implemented, will essentially achieve the same permission control. Therefore, you should treat Group == role in Django. DRF access control by who you are There are two types of users — authenticated, and anonymous. Authenticated users are further divided in Django as. Note that staff user could also have Group so D and E are not exclusive to each other. In the followings I'm treating E as the super set of D . . ├── A : anonymous └── B : authenticated ├── C : super ├── D : staff / admin ( User ' s `is_staff=True`) └── E : User <- ( n : n ) -> Group We code name them as ABCDE . So, how to control who can do what? DRF Permission Anon can use Can Read Can Write Enforce Model Permission AllowAny yes A,B A,B none IsAuthenticated no B B none IsAuthenticatedOrReadOnly yes A,B B none IsAdminUser no D D none DjangoModelPermissions no permission(B) permission(B) B's CRUD DjangoModelPermissionsOrAnon yes A,B permission(B) B's CUD DjangoObjectPermissions no permission(B) permission(B) B's CRUD django-oauth-toolkit access control by scope Finally, we can look at the ACL of django-auto-toolkit , which is just a list of permissions in addition to DRF permissions! This extension focuses on checking the oauth scope by the token, and can be combined in AND w/ all other DRF permissions , and then through DRF's DjangoModelPermissions , it will be further tied into Django model permissions: class SongView ( views . APIView ): authentication_classes = [ OAuth2Authentication ] permission_classes = [ TokenHasScope , DjangoModelPermissions ] <== work together ! required_scopes = [ 'music' ] Below shows the behavior of toolkit permission behaviors. Because OAuth2 user must have been authenticated, all these are not applicable to anonymous users. Control required_scopes authentication_classes Read Write Enforce Model Permission TokenHasScope required [OAuth2Authentication] has all required_scopes has all required_scopes none TokenHasReadWriteScope optional [OAuth2Authentication] has read scope has write scope none TokenHasResourceScope required [OAuth2Authentication] has music:read scope has music:write scope none IsAuthenticatedOrTokenHasScope required DRF's has music:read scope or authenticated has music:write scope or authenticated should use permission_classes = [IsAuthenticatedOrTokenHasScope, DjangoModelPermission] TokenMatchesOASRequirements required_alternate_scopes per method [OAuth2Authentication] has all scopes by the HTTP verb has all scopes by the HTTP verrb no Complicated, isn't it!?","tags":"dev","url":"https://fengxia41103.github.io/myblog/django%20permission%20oauth2.html"},{"title":"Full stack Django on k8s","text":"Assuming you already know k8s basics.

So the question is how to migrate these dockers onto k8s? In my case, three components are going onto k8s: frontend, backend, celery. Registry . In development mode, docker images are usually built and stored on the local where the docker-compose is launched. This is not the case in k8s anymore. Essential difference is that k8s does not build image . It's to take the artifact from some registry and deploy. Therefore, for the two application-specific images — Django app and frontend, the images must be built beforehand and pushed to a registry. In our case I'm using a private Harbor. Harbor is deployed outside the k8s cluster. I'm assuming it has its own admin, storage, and so on. The integration point is a Harbor user/token for k8s to pull image from it. I'll cover this later. Django setting . Need to parameterize some settings and read them from env. The env would be fed by container launcher just like the env: list in compose. There are two sets of envs — one sensitive info such as password, and one not sensitive. The former will be in k8s secret, the latter as configmap. Which settings to be parameterized is subjective. See section for mine. React dotnev . Frontend dotenv is not dynamic . It's baked inside the built image. Thus, you must decide on a deployment strategy for the Django api service, and coordinate this w/ frontend's dotenv. The strategy will determine the service's uri, which then is baked into frontend's image. Because the k8s-generated uri is rather dynamic, eg. namespace, service name, this coordination must be done offline before frontend can be deployed. Celery workers . Image is the same as the Django app, only the command is different. Key is to scale its replica so we can control how quickly to drain a queue. You can play w/ the launch command -Q summary,stock,statement,price,news -l INFO to decide how you want to deploy these workers. For example, should they all be watching the same queue, or one for each? and the log level? Redis, DB . I call these common services. They don't have to live on the same cluster . If they already exist somewhere else, migration can use them directly. In my case, I'm leaving DB outside the k8s, thinking service such as RDS or a dedicated DBA is better than me administrating a DB. Redis will be moved to k8s because it's used as a message broker. So it's transient in nature for me. But if you use it for data records, it may be better off just like RDS service. In other words, I'm expecting k8s cluster to scale of application, frontend, transient services, but leaving persisted data to a professional . Customer A,B,C, ingress . Imagine this application is sold to multiple customers. Backend, frontend, and celery will be in a namespace, whereas redis service is shared. Backend API is exposed in k8s ingress, and further config is required to be accessible from the internet such as using an external node LB . Each api's url will be different, eg. app.client-a.feng.local , app.client-b.feng.local . In production this will be customer's full domain. The api's url will be baked into frontend image via dotenv. End state After everything is done: Harbor You need to configure Harbor project and access to this project. Then add the access info to k8s: kubectl create secret docker-registry harbor \\ --docker-server = blah \\ --docker-username = blah \\ --docker-password = blah \\ --docker-email = blah Then, in helm values.yaml , specify the image to use: image : repository : harbor.feng.local:9800/library/frontend_stock pullPolicy : Always <== Use this is best practice!!! tag : \"v1.1.0.beta\" tag and push To push an image to harbor: List the docker images you have on the server/dev machine, docker image ls . Tag an image: docker tag e6bbf5e4d606 harbor.feng.local:9800/library/frontend_stock:v1.0.0 e6... : is the image digest harbor.feng.local:9800 : the harbor server & port. You should be able to see the web UI by going to https://harbor.feng.local:9800 . library : is a project inside harbor. frontend_stock : your image name, could be anything. In harbor this is called a repository . v1.0.0 : image tag. Then, docker push harbor.feng.local:9800/library/frontend_stock:v1.0.0 , and watch the image uloaded to harbor. Goto harbor to double check. Parameterize frontend docker In order to bake dotenv into frontend image: yarn install -D env-cmd . Update package.json : \"start\": \"env-cmd -f envs/$ENV... craco...\" , whereas we dotenv files are under the envs/ folder. Also, parameter $ENV so that cli becomes ENV=blah yarn start . Same goes to build: . ```json \"scripts\": { \"start\": \"env-cmd -f envs/$ENV craco start\", }, ``` Add arg to Dockerfile. There is a good article about ARG vs. ENV. To build, docker build --build-arg BUILD_FOR=a_value... . ``` # build environment FROM node:16.15.1 as builder ARG NPM_TOKEN < == private npm registry token ARG BUILD_FOR < == env parameter ... # npmrc RUN echo \"//npm.pkg.github.com/:_authToken= ${ NPM_TOKEN } \" >> ~/.npmrc RUN echo \"//npm.pkg.github.com/:_authToken= ${ NPM_TOKEN } \" >> ~/.yarnrc ... # build RUN env-cmd -f envs/ ${ BUILD_FOR } yarn run build < == use env parameter ... ``` (optional) Add the same Dockerfile args to docker-compose . This is really for convenience and consistency so that using compose will achieve the same effect as above. To use, BUILD_FOR=blah NPM_TOKEN=blah docker-compose up --build frontend . ```yaml frontend: image: frontend_stock build: context: ./frontend dockerfile: ./Dockerfile args: BUILD_FOR: ${ BUILD_FOR } NPM_TOKEN: ${ NPM_TOKEN } ``` Now you can build the image, tag it, then push to harbor. However you are earmarking the image to be client-A's vs. B's is your choice ← different tag, different project, whatever. Docker tagging is itself a topic which is not covered here. Django setting params There are endless options to parameterize Django app. For my purpose a few things worth highlighting here: DJANGO_DEBUG = bool ( int ( os . environ . get ( \"DJANGO_DEBUG\" ) or 0 )) DATABASE = os . environ . get ( \"MYSQL_DATABASE\" ) DEPLOY_TYPE = os . environ . get ( \"DEPLOY_TYPE\" , \"dev\" ) DB_USER = os . environ . get ( \"DJANGO_DB_USER\" ) DB_PWD = os . environ . get ( \"DJANGO_DB_PWD\" ) DB_HOST = os . environ . get ( \"DJANGO_DB_HOST\" ) DB_PORT = os . environ . get ( \"DJANGO_DB_PORT\" ) REDIS_HOST = os . environ . get ( \"DJANGO_REDIS_HOST\" ) redis REDIS_HOST is used as BROKER_URL = \"redis://%s:6379/0\" % REDIS_HOST , whereas the value follows the format <user>:<pwd>@<server> . Default user for redis is default , and there seems to only possible to change password by this helm . For example: default : blah @ redis - master . redis . svc . cluster . local Be sure to use the redis-master because celery will require a write access. Other replicas are for read-only. Provide env from k8s Save the values in two files. Keys should be the env's key, thus be sure it's the same as the Python code os.env[\"blah\"] key. ```conf # configmap DJANGO_DEBUG=1 MYSQL_DATABASE= DEPLOY_TYPE=dev DJANGO_DB_HOST= DJANGO_DB_PORT= # secret MYSQL_USER= MYSQL_PASSWORD= MYSQL_ROOT_PASSWORD= DJANGO_DB_USER= DJANGO_DB_PWD= DJANGO_REDIS_HOST= ``` Create configmap and secret from the files. Note the names stock-backend-env and stock-backend-secret . They will be used next. ```shell kubectl create configmap stock-backend-env \\ --from-env-file=config-dotenv \\ --namespace client-a k create secret generic stock-backend-secret \\ --from-env-file=secret-dotenv \\ --namespace client-a ``` In helm's values.yaml : ```yml env: configmap: stock-backend-env secret: stock-backend-secret ``` In helm's deployment.yaml , use envFrom in the container section: ```yml containers: - name: {{ .Chart.Name }} envFrom: <== Import k8s configmap & secret as env!!! {{ - with .Values.env.configmap }} - configMapRef: name: \" {{ - toYaml . }} \" {{ - end }} {{ - with .Values.env.secret }} - secretRef: name: \" {{ - toYaml . }} \" {{ - end }} ``` frontend helm A few special considerations: By default I'm disabling ingress. This is just an extra layer of protection against accident in deployment. ```yml ingress: enabled: false ``` Then, I create a profiles/ folder to hold ingress profile for each client. For example, client A's will be profiles/client-a.yaml as: ```yml ingress: enabled: true className: \"nginx\" annotations: nginx.ingress.kubernetes.io/rewrite-target: / hosts: - host: client-a.blah.com <== A's domain paths: - path: / pathType: Prefix tls: [] ``` Now when I deploy for A using and enable its ingress: helm install stock-frontend helm \\ -n client-a \\ -f path/to/profiles/client-a.yaml \\ now, deploy for client A By now I have three helms: backend api, celery, and frontend. Create/pick a namespace, say client-a . Create envs as configmap & secret. Backend api. In order to override list value ingress.hosts[0] , you must use -f path/to/values.yaml ← this is a helm known limitation. ```shell helm install stock-backend-api helm-stock-backend-api \\ -n client-a \\ -f helm-stock-backend-api/values.yaml \\ --set \"ingress.hosts[0].host=client-a.blah.com\" \\ --set image.tag=\"blah\" ``` Backend celery. Easy. ```shell helm install stock-backend-celery helm-stock-backend-celery \\ -n client-a \\ --set image.tag=\"blah\" ``` Frontend. ```shell helm install stock-frontend helm \\ -n client-a \\ -f helm/profiles/client-a.yaml \\ --set image.tag=\"blah\" ``` If using an external nginx as LB to cluster nodes, add a server block in nginx conf: ``` conf server { server_name client-a.blah.com ; location / { include /etc/nginx/proxy_params ; proxy_pass http : // k8s ; } } ``` Reload the LB nginx, and visit http://client-a.blah.com . You should be good to go.","tags":"dev","url":"https://fengxia41103.github.io/myblog/full%20stack%20django%20on%20k8s.html"},{"title":"Nikon DF split screen","text":"I recently got a DF, and put a split screen in it. I'm not a handy man. I was very hesitant about this, but really wanted to give this a shot for my manual lenses. So if you are also hesitating, and need some positive feedback, read on. Started with this detailed blog . I ordered mine from focusingscreen . The website is old fashioned, but serves the purpose. I guess it's such a niche that the owner has no incentive to upgrade it. Using US credit card leads you to another web page, which I guess is a 3rd party service. So the experience was jumping from main site → payment site → main site. The convention wisdom is, don't use browser's BACK button in this process! Just let it go through. If you stuck, you can always cancel the order w/ the vendor (it's a slow order, so you get time), and through your credit card company. I actually had doubt whether my payment went through. For that, you could check the My Account tab, which shows payment success. You could further check your CC's that there is a payment pending w/ the amount you intended. what you get I ordered it on 7/24, arrived 8/19. Be patient. In between I had many times swing back and forth of actually changing the screen. What if I scratch either screen? What if I smear it w/ finger print? What if I have focus issue afterward? back/front focus? what else? What if it's not centered, and I'm super OCD? There is a DPreview post, in which the guy basically saying \"dont do it\" cause you are going inevitably ruin both screens, and ended up with a handicapped camera. The agony goes on and on. Then just before I started to wonder maybe it's lost in mail and saved me from agonizing, it's here! Package itself is low key. Just another international mail. Inside you have the followings. I'm copying & pasting from a sheet included in the package which has a \"Material list\" section: Focusing screen and original packing box Tweezers: Picking focusing screen's edge or mount tab to exchange. Fingerstall Transparent pad: It's used to adjust focus. Special tools: For some difficult installation, special tools can help to unlock. Everything is wrapped in a clear plastic wrap, then a bubble wrap. camera position In his blog , shots are showing the camera in normal position. You can tell by the aperture contact on the top of the screen mount. When I was doing it, mine was upside down — it sits on the flash mount side, because the screen will not fall out if I disengage the metal clip which holds it down. Note: the camera won't sit by itself. I had left hand holding it in that position. You could use some help or whatever to achieve this. The idea is the same. It doesn't need to be 90 degree straight as long as the screen won't just fall out by gravity. This is important because it will then give me the chance to pause and think about how to remove it. After all, I'm new to this like anyone! Be slow an cautious. the screen The screen sits inside the Canon box. As mentioned in other places, this screen is essentially a Canon screen w/ some customization to fit DF size. The entire package was mint ! I don't know how they could have done this without leaving even a finger print or crumpling some paper packaging material. Well done! The screen sits inside a plastic box in the package as if it were originally made by Canon! Everything is mint! There is a small plastic tool in the box w/ the screen. It seems to be for grabbing the tab of the screen. But it's difficult to use . I tried to use it to grab the DF screen out. But it's too clumsy to be useful. I would not recommend using it. The screen has two sides, one matte, one glossy. The original screen has glossy side facing down if installed. So is the new one. The easiest way to remember this is that the tab is on your right-hand side if it's installed, the camera is upstraight, and you are looking at the camera through the lens mount. When I was installing it, my camera was upside-down (sitting on its flash mount), thus the tab is on the left-hand side . With this as additional reference, you simply will not install it in the wrong way . This is like computer, parts can only be installed into the slot in one way due to the design. Same principle applies here. This was a major concern to me. So if this is also yours, rest assured. special tool In the instruction it's called \"special tool\". In practice, this is the tool you want to use! Notice the tiny lip at the end? It's perfect to push onto the metal wire clip to release the screen! I say push because, again, my camera is upside down. Actually I found pushing motion gives you more control over how much force you apply, and sense how tightly the wire clip is being latched. My biggest fear was if the tool slips, then scratch my screen. So first of all, make sure the tool is about 90 degree to the wire. You don't want to push side ways . Then, feel how well the lip is against the wire. I put it onto the wire a couple times just to get a feel, like stepping on the gas pedal of a new car. On my 3rd try, the wire just popped open!! Honestly I wasn't even ready for it! I felt the wire was not even latched properly to begin with!! WTF!? But anyway. No more hesitation. The show is on! rubber finger condom I don't know what it's called. It's just like condom. I decided to put them on my left hand index finger and thumb, because I'm going to use them to grab the screen, which in the end was exactly how I did it. I deliberately left my right hand bare, so it's the tool hand. I decided that I will not use it touch the screen unless it's an emergency, which, if happened, is pretty much a mission failed. how to remove the screen As mentioned, I tried that plastic tool first. It's too big for the lens mount space, and the tab is on my left hand side, so using the right hand to use this tool makes even harder. After maybe 2 tries I just give it all up. With the wire clip unlatched, the screen is about to fall if you tilt the camera. I wanted to have some control of this process. So first thing I did was to use a tweezer to hold the wire so that it will not let the screen completely out-of-control. I didn't use tweezer to grab the screen because tweezer is metal, and I didn't want to scratch the screen. Now with tweezer controls the clip like a door, I could have some breathing time to see how to grab the screen. In the end, I just used the two fingers w/ condom to grab the screen, and off it's out! My heart was pounding like hell at this moment. Then, I looked at the two sides of the screen, and note which side facing which direction. As said before, the glossy side facing down after installed (when camera in normal position), and the matte size is facing the viewfinder. install new screen New screen has matte and glossy sides, also. I then further confirmed the direction by the tab's position. Then, still using the condom fingers to grab the screen, I just drop it in. By gravity, it sits right into the housing. I tilted the camera side ways, but didn't see any give. So the screen has been cut-to-size , and there is no room to play! This is good. Put the wire back Getting the wire back was a bit more than I expected. Using the same special tool, pushing onto the wire, but this time having a bit downward motion so it will go under the plastic latch clip. I didn't want to put too much force onto the wire fearing it will fail or the tool slip. So it took me 4-5 tries before it went it. The last one I had to put on a bit of force, so be aware . As before, make sure the tool is 90 degrees more-or-less to the wire, so it will not slip. I was hoping to hear a \"clicking\" sound as proof, but I didn't . I could, however, feel the engagement through the tool, like a tiny vibration. So trust your finger and sense. shims No idea. I didn't play with the shims. I have no heart to do this again. It front-focus a bit. But hell, I will just develop muscle memory to shift a tiny bit when the split says perfect, then I'm dead on. This is much easier than playing with the shims. So no idea why there are two types of shims — one transparent plastic, one with brown rim. Different thickness? Well well, I'm leaving them alone. afterthought It works very well! I'm not totally old school, but I enjoy this additional assistance. I actually don't know what's the trick of using split screen when I'm shooting things that are not at the center. But well well, DF now feels the way it should be by design. I highly recommend this vendor if you are thinking to try out a split screen on whichever digital camera you have. It's professional, well made, and worth a shot.","tags":"thoughts","url":"https://fengxia41103.github.io/myblog/nikon%20df%20split%20screen.html"},{"title":"Oshin","text":"At age 50, I watched Oshin again, and found myself understand much of this movie now. I remember the moments when my mom was in tears watching this, and I couldn't understand at all why she would do that. I was about Noah's age. Now, even without going through as much as Oshin had, without suffering the pain of war, I could not help knowing why it's so touching. What an epic, really, the misery of life, of the era, of the terrible ordeal a human must go through, and how fleeting a life really is. In the end, what is remaining? The names would be all gone, forgotten, the stories buried, and who would have ever remember there had been such a person, such an emotion, such a struggle, be it a villain or a hero!? I have been fortunate so far. Yet, I could feel the tie between theirs and mine. Maybe it's the feeling of loss of someone you endear, love, or something, or a moment which you could never live again.... it's hard. Really. Life is a drama that is so full of surprise and regrets, that it felt sometimes too long to bear, and sometimes too short to dare. One keeps moving forward, day by day, not knowing what is ahead, where is the end, yet one strives to be meaningful, happy, satisfied. Perhaps the only thing that is always meaningful, is the heart of gold, to be kind, to give someone in distress a hand, to be grateful if receiving such, and to live truthful to yourself. Dust to dust, scattered in the wind, leaving no trace, but a feel.","tags":"thoughts","url":"https://fengxia41103.github.io/myblog/oshin.html"},{"title":"Today's China is sickening","text":"This news hit me. As a father w/ my son at the same age as these girls, I felt very sad. I can not imagine how I would take such a thing if it happened on Noah. The center of my universe would have collapsed, and there is nothing left for me to hold on in this world, this life. If I ever survived such a blow, I would nothing but a walking zombie without emotion but hatred, of myself, of the harsh things I have done to Noah when he was little, of his requests which I failed to meet, of moments I didn't choose to be with him... regret will be like a virus eating my heart from inside out until a death would look like a much better option than breathing. Sad. I feel this anger inside me, like cloud rising. I'll be a coward, perhaps, just like the parents who were waiting in the hospital while under control of those authorities. But I can't. I'll feel such an urge to attack, to grab his fxxk neck and go into a fight, so that it's better than suffering the misery of being powerless to save. How familiar it is when they were asked to sign a paper of death before they could look at their children even for identification purpose. Isn't this the same, regular, standard move when I was asked to sign dad's paper? I remember that. I hate, not the puppet sent by the bureaucracy, but the bureaucracy itself, the 院长 who is a coward... I guess, in the end, I hate cowardice, in myself and in others. Chapel Hill had a bad fire this weekend. Noah and I went to the scene. When I couldn't find him for a while, I felt nearly a panic strike. But after I remember the kid said to me before he asked to run ahead by himself to the scene:\"I want to go and check what I could help.\" At the time I warned him to stay away from the scene, certainly the idea, because I don't him to be unsafe. But, now writing this when all these have passed, I feel proud of him — it's a noble first instinct. When someday he were the one stepping forward to shoulder a tough burden, I wouldn't be surprised. I will feel very sad if he is harmed, but I would always feel proud that he were not a coward. China, that piece of land, which I grew up, and felt to heart at some point in my life, is now sickening. I can't imagine the policemen, who is about in his 40s or 50s, could face another father losing his child without feeling the pain. I won't be able to hold myself. Duty, isn't the opposite of empathy. I would have given them a hug, tearing with them, do what I can to bring dignity to them and the children. 一路走 好, is an empty phrase. I would rather say, keep your pride, know the pain this has given to the livings, it's really tough. But also, know their love will not disappear, whichever world you are.","tags":"thoughts","url":"https://fengxia41103.github.io/myblog/china%20sickening.html"},{"title":"Chinese superstition","text":"Browsing Zhihu is depressing these days. Constantly I came across titles which I could only call, thus the title, chinese superstition . Not only that many there are indeed superstitious in the conventional sense, but that the brainwash education and propaganda have further done damage that there are some only could be called urban legend are now being thrown around as fact, or at least as some strong evidence to back up a statement, which then by the nature of these evidence being so shaky or outwright false, is itself a logical result of a faulty reasoning that is worthless. Yet, just like a lie or a scam could still fool many, or maybe even to fool some of the people all of the time , they are received w/ ardor defenders, and supported by countless referrals. Since this is quite a phenomenon, I'd like to keep a note here, just for the fun of it. Conclusion in shape of a question This is a common practice, that a statement/opinion is posted in shape of a question, eg. \"为什么说中华文明对世界的贡献远大于西方文明\". Don't be fooled by the \"why\". It has nothing to do w/ seeking an answer. Rather, it is a clear statement w/ a comparison (it always has a \"A is better than B\" frame!), which the author is already opinionated. Thus, the comments could only be a heated argument that one side debates another. This makes me wonder, what is a question? I don't want to use the word \"good\" because an adjective makes this even harder to answer. A question, in my mind, should be a phrase seeking a truth of something. It should be neutral, taking no side yet one way or another, but focus on the thing at hand, the phenomenon, the symptom, the known. I don't know whether you absolutely can not ask a sided question like this. If this is indeed the point you are seeking more insights, I think this is just as valid. However, they are not genuine when seen on those Chinese forums — they are simply a provocative line that fans a flame. This actually reminds tactics of both the Nazi's and those professional revolutioners'. If so, then this again casts a shaddy shadow on such question forms. Sometimes it makes me wonder why Nazi and communist so look alike!? Genetics? 中华 It's pretty funny how Chinese are considering this word indisputable. I disagree. First of all, this is pretty much a racial term in their mind because it certainly extends way beyond the scope of geography. Dragged in a time axis, this term can include anything that has a faint hint of an intercourse w/ anything they consider to be their own. Like Decarte's \"therefore I am\", they need a single anchor to start a whole universe. Thus, as long as they can find such an anchor, which by way are plenty to grab, some solid and some bogus (which I will touch upon in other sections), they can extend its reach to infinity and beyond. Just look at the three categories they love the most: racial, geographical, cultural. First, geo. This is the easiest to visualize. As long as you ever put a single toe on the soil of anywhere between the old and/or new of its border, it's a 中华 by definition. This makes it convenient then that using the largest ever map would be beneficial. So by this thread Roman could pretty much declare quite some Roman descendants , the Great Britian could say half of world is still Great Britian, and the most strong support for Chinese is, Mongols. Thanks for their effort, the world was either Chinese or influenced ( always in a beneficial way, of course ) by the Chinese. Second, racial. If Mongol had European look, that could have spoiled the fun. But how wonderful! Instead of Chinese being categorized as a Mongo look, it's turned around that Mongo is nothing but a strain in the overall 中华 race. This concept, 中华, will have hard time to fly if racial difference is, obvious → it's far fetched already to call all the 56 races 中华 despite that Uyghur people apparently look more central Asian than 中华 residents. So even though Mongo invaded Europe, thanks to their different racial profile, they have to wait even today to be included as 中华. Sorry. But other than that, China is pretty taking itself as the sole gene pool for the entire Asia! Even though seagoing wasn't China's forte, but hell, sperms could swim, right!? Why can't they swim around the Atlantic and make everywhere 中华. So they must have. Thirdly, cultural. Well. This is a catch-all. Geo could be seen on planet earth. Race has definition. But cultural, particular if using their term, the \"influenced by\", has no boundary. What makes a 中华 culture? what is not? and how can anything not to be influenced by, anything!? This way of thinking has just manifested recently in its Covid time when China made up the term \"时空传染\" ← just like culture, it passes in the air, in your dream... — the key is, you can't prove innocent. Period. There you have it, the 中华. I'm pretty sure Martians were influenced by 中华, also. Just wait till they show up so I could prove it to you. 中华文明 This, as always used in the context of the four ancient civilization, which accordingly was promoted by 梁启超, is a super weapon of nationalism. First, it's recent but appears hold. His days, February 23, 1873 – January 19, 1929. So giving 20 years to maturity, we are looking at this line being put out around 1893 or later. Yet, this is freely quoted as if this was written by Jesus, stamped approval by Buddha, and carved in stone by Gia herself. While Zhihuers sneers at US for its short history, they don't think twice a phrase less than half US's age is, undependable! Second, civilization . This is a total misnomer. It's focus is on the have vs. have-not. As long as you have those categories you are a civilization. Whether it's a good one or bad one, hard to tell. Therefore, I think there is nothing be proud of simply because China is a civilization. Just watched a document the other day on Aztec civilization, in which a captured warrior was tied to pole w/ a rope while fighting to his death w/ other warriors — he was to be sacrificed to winner's god, in a slow, bloody way. It's a civilization, alright. But it's disgusting. 文明, is meant for something nice, pleasant, satisfying. However, I found little such traits in Aztec's civilization, nor in the 中华文明. 西方 I don't know whether it's Kant or Hague who must make the world A vs. B. It's definitely Nazi's way, so is today China's. It's starting from annoying to now nonsensical that any dimension could be split along the line of 东方 vs. 西方, whereas 东方 could be further tied to a Chinese influence which I have talked about earlier in 中华 section. Therefore, the split is conveniently becoming China vs. 西方. But I would say, doing so is to China's disadvantage. First, 西方 is much bigger than China. It's pretty obvious that counting by any dimension — land, population, resource — (world - China) is greater than China . Period. Carving the world like is even sillier than the Pope carving the globe for Spain and Portugal, which, btw, was in 1494. 529 years later, China still thinks this way. Second, competition instead of collaboration. Once you draw a line between mine and theirs, how are you to benefit from theirs if theirs are good? Only one of two ways now, take or steal, and that's exactly what China is doing these years. When science has brought the entire mankind out of dark age, having such a view could only hurt your own chance of survival. Stupid. Third, who is the barbarian? Deep down in their brainwash scheme, it's pretty funny that you would find ancient Greek in its action — the world has two groups of people, the Greeks, and the barbarians. China thinks they are the Greeks. I'm quite sure those barbarians were joking about those Greeks being monkeys, too. What this reveals is a self-centered view point that was valid 2000 years ago, but trashy in 2023. 5000 years, and continuous This is the Chinese superstition in the making. 5000!? wouldn't 4999 be a better one by Chinese taste? First, archaeology hasn't proved it. All culture have some mythology that start with the origin of human, and of course, them being the direct bloodline of that. But counting your calendar by that is for maniacs. Who takes it to heart that Jesus was born exactly on the 0 year of our calendar, conveniently or coincidentally!? It's nothing but a counter. But if you take it seriously, what a fool! Second, non-broken. Well, if using any of the three 中华 threads, it's perceivable that as long as there is human on earth, we could certainly call it non-broken. After all, it's pretty much implied that all human have one gene or two by China's origin, whatever it may be. Mine is mine, yours is mine. Too bad China hasn't yet come up a theory to conclude that Greeks were indeed migrants from, \"China\", so that its history covers this planet end-to-end. why always me This is inferior complex. Why 受伤的总是我. The 100 years of 屈辱 is like a birth mark on every single Chinese today as if there is an original sin. If pounding a children over and over to believe in his/her deficiency at birth is criminal, then a government doing such to its citizen is also a crime. Now, like wearing a filter in front of eyes, this world is forever the color of this filter. So, there is 总有人想害朕. The world is hating China. US is targeting China. All are barbarians at gate, 图我的钱财或 是美貌.... so on and on. The bottom line is, I am always 对的. Give me a break. 自古以来 I have already reasoned that introducing a time dimension such as the 5000-year-history is problematic. But at least there is a fixed number. With a phrase of 自古以来, there is no boundary. Futher, the \" 古\" can be thought for 盘古, the mythical figure who split heaven from earth out of a big chaos, the very first being , the start of this earth life as we know it. Therefore, this carries an ambiguous tone that can be easily extended to that far. But that just means it includes absolutely anything human has ever known since the clock started. So no wonder using this is convenient for the Chinese to feel that anything humanly possible is, his. Even with its constrained form, there is simply no rule of how much further such a backtracing can go — 100 years? 200 years?.... thus, it becomes completely arbitrary as the argument needs. Slapping this time decorator onto any topic, it becomes a historical \"fact\" ! But it certainly invites a question whenever it's used → why stop here!? Why not trace further back? If Tibet is so as \"自古以来\" since the Qing dynasty, well, how about it at Ming's time? or Qin's time? of 盘古's time? Really. What determines your time-of-choice being the one while all others are invalid? Such is the BS. I always joked about that according to such time magic, not only 自古以来Austria is China's, but our history will be enriched by such historical figures — Beethoven, Mozart, and quite recently, Hitler. Do you really want this? I don't. 华人 This is a flexible term whose scope shifts constantly, just like the Yellow River's pass. I don't know what dimension it operated on. Since I have already discussed geo, race, time, culture, let me touch upon another one here, which is used/implied by this term to manifest its weight — bloodline. If ever you had a Chinese ascendants, and god knows how far you trace, you get the blood , thus. This makes me wonder, does relative count? how far out of my family tree can I go until I invalidate such identity? For immigrants this is a pretty real question, and it's really a math question ← keep dividing by 2, the bloodline draws pretty thin after, say, 10 generation, and forget about 64 generations and beyond. And what if, 23th generation down the line, my guy/girl marries another full-blood chinese (if there were even such a thing!)? Does it reset the counter? or prorate (1/(2&#94;23)+1)/2 ? Compounded? But it's not quite right, either. Looking at the Qing Dynasty, the ruling class, at least the royal family, kept their bloodline pure . So, were they 华人? If no, what was theirs, whether good or evil, wasn't 华人's, either. So, why should I feel proud of theirs achievement, or shame of their wrong doings? As a matter of fact, they were the 鞑虏, weresn't they? The convenience of this term is that it shares all the honor you earn, and bears no responsibility of any kind — if you get a recognition, well, you are a 华人, regardless where you are, who you are, what your ancestors were, when they ever left the land, as long you have that Mongol look, you are 华人. So, I would say, this is a category of your \"look\" → sounds racist now, doesn't it!? laundry list 为什么说中华文明对世界的贡献远大于西方文明? 美国很早就获得光刻技术专利，为何没有诞生ASML这样的公司？ 为什么四大文明古国中唯一传承至今的只有中国？ \"四大\"文明古国中，为何只有中国延续至今，其它都被先后毁灭？ 跑了19万人，加拿大又来捅刀子，香港能挺住吗？ 耶伦回家，中国救不了美国 为什么只有中华文明可以再度崛起? 中华文明在过去为什么能够领先全球？ 为什么美国总是对中国不友好？ 美国为什么衰落的如此之快? 为什么明明是中国的工人、中产，网络上很多人仍然愿意为西方说话，即使 他们在宏观上对自己的利益产生威胁？ 为什么突破性的技术总是最先发生在西方？ 中国人口这么多，为什么顶端人才比不了西方？ 中国人很聪明，为什么现代科学却起源于西方？ 为什么溥仪一个汉奸，还要整天尬吹？ C919都完善了，还要波音干啥？ 为什么中国不自己开发一个汉字的电脑，底层用汉字编写，有一套汉字的汇 编语言、高级语言？ 南京的没落主要是由于什么造成的？ 如何反驳元清非中国的谬论？","tags":"thoughts","url":"https://fengxia41103.github.io/myblog/chinese%20superstition.html"},{"title":"One is not the many","text":"I would not have thought the word 苏州 had popped up in the headline news because of such a tragedy . But the aftermath of many netizen comments is really what I want to talk about here. It's quite common that the act of this woman being painted as a savior of a national pride, which, regardless my disagreement of the comment itself, is also implying that the pride is in a decline in recent times. Thus, a heroic event such as this became a counter argument of such decline, saying that not all are lost, not all are bad people, and there are still good eggs left, which usually also implying that majority of us are the good eggs. However, this is a flawed logic. Period. The act of this person proved one thing, and one thing alone, that she was a hero. She, herself, no one else but herself, was a good egg. She had no intention to represent anyone else, nor she had any obligation, or right, to represent anyone other than herself. This statement holds true to everyone of us here. The comment seems elevating her to a height as if bestowing a glory. Further, it even carried a tone that a commoner as such is now being recognized on a stage, which, as the rule if not the law, is reserved only to the privilege, because being on this stage can only be allowed if some highup gives the nod. What a nonsense! This so called glory is not a glory at all. This praise is not a praise for the mere reason that it is insincere, untrue, and unwanted. She did not ask for this, nor had consented being put on such a stage. On the contrary, I'm certain that she didn't want this tragedy to happen at all, let alone she paid the dearest price! What is happening is that her body is being dragged out of peace, laying on a platform under a spot light, words forced into her own mouth so to back up a theory, a justification, an evidence, while none of these had previously paid slightest attention of her! What a shameful play! This is not a glory you are awarding her! This, is killing her twice! thrice! What will happen to her tragedy then after this five minute of fame? Flushed away just like another piece of toilet paper that had wiped some shit off the dirty ass. Shame. Total, shame. Stop linking her to those political BS, those nationalistic BS, those cultural, historical BS. Her heroism has nothing to do w/ stopping the decline of the national pride, of proving that Chinese still have moral left, of having still some good eggs left. Stop using her to wipe clean anyone's ass, mine included. Each of us is an individual. I'm responsible for my own behavior, my own decision, my own judgment, not much of my own fate but I try, and my own conscience. So should we all be. Only then, when we could look at ourselves as such, and look at her as such, there is then a hope no more nationalism, no more cultural revolution, no more stupidity, no more manipulation, and no more such senseless tragedy.","tags":"thoughts","url":"https://fengxia41103.github.io/myblog/one%20is%20not%20the%20many.html"},{"title":"k8s lab","text":"I'm surprised that no article is giving a clear setup of a home k8s lab w/ a Linux host. So here it is. On Dev node On your dev node, which is a machine outside k8s cluster node. Assuming you have the following installed already: Python and python venv module. Ansible. Install it in a venv . KVM stuff. See my dev's kvm project for details. You could also use any VM framework as long as you could create 3 VMs. ssh-keygen to create SSH key. If you already have a previous one, you could either use the same key, or create a new one dedicated for automation by changing the default value below: shell Enter file in which to save the key (/home/fengxia/.ssh/id_rsa): Create a $HOME/.kube . Install kubectl . I may ansible this later as well. For now a manual process. In Ansible working directory, dump a vanilla ansible config file: ansible-config init --disabled > ansible.cfg . Change the line private_key_file=/home/fengxia/.ssh/id_rsa_auto to point it to the SSH key we are to use for. Install helm . Bootstrap k8s cluster We bootstrap using ansible. Start three VMs, one control node and two worker nodes. Write their IPs in the hosts . You could either use the cloud-init to bake in the SSH's pub key, or do ssh-copy-id -i ~/.ssh/id_rsa_auto.pub fengxia@ip to copy them manually. Test ssh fengxia@ip after that keys are working. Run ansible: ansible-playbook -i hosts bootstrap.yml On your dev node, scp fengxia@ip:~/.kube/config ~/.kube/config to copy the cluster config to the dev machine. IP could be any of the k8s nodes because the same config are on k8s storage For local dev purpose, use server disks on worker nodes, aka. local storage, for data persistence. provisioner Note that there is no kubectl command to list installed provisioners. Add static provisioner helm repo: ```shell helm repo add \\ sig-storage-local-static-provisioner \\ https://kubernetes-sigs.github.io/sig-storage-local-static-provisioner helm repo update ``` Re-generate a provisioner config: shell helm template --debug \\ sig-storage-local-static-provisioner/local-static-provisioner \\ --version 1 \\ --namespace default \\ > local-volume-provisioner.generated.yaml` Install or delete this provisioner: shell kubectl apply -f local-volume-provisioner.generated.yaml kubectl delete -f local-volume-provisioner.generated.yaml storage class The metadata.name value is important . kubectl apply -f storage-class.yml # to list all storage classes kubectl get sc # to delete a storage class kubectl delete sc <name> PV Now create a PV which can be claimed by deployments. kubectl apply -f pv.yml # to list all PVs kubectl get pv Note that helm uninstall does not delete PVC nor the actual data. You could observe it by watching the data mount, eg. /mnt/disks . Essentially it is not yet observing PV's retention policy Delete . Therefore, it's advised to manually delete PVC first, then delete PV, then rm -r /mnt/disks/data , if data cleanup is needed. # to delete a PV kubectl delete pv <name> # delete by force kubectl delete pv local-pv-20g --grace-period = 0 --force # clear etcd record kubectl patch pv local-pv-20g -p '{\"metadata\": {\"finalizers\": null}}' Deploy an app This is easy w/ helm. You can set custom configs using a values.yml file, eg. wordpress-values.yml in this case to specify the mariadb's storageClass . It's deeply nested YAML structure, no fun if typing in cmd. helm repo add bitnami https://charts.bitnami.com/bitnami helm repo update # install w/ customized config values helm install -f wordpress-values.yml happy-panda bitnami/wordpress # uninstall helm uninstall happy-panda # if setting configs on CLI: helm install happy-pada bitnami/wordpress \\ --set mariadb.primary.persistence.enabled = true \\ --set mariadb.primary.persistence.storageClass = local-storage \\ --set mariadb.primary.persistence.size = 20Gi \\ --set persistence.enabled = false Expose an app There are two ways, both use nodeport. But who is behind the nodeport is different. In the first method, the app itself is listenning a nodeport, and in the 2nd method an ingress controller is. Nodeport directly Get the name of your app service w/ kubectl get svc : ``` NAME TYPE CLUSTER-IP EXTERNAL-IP PORT(S) AGE happy-panda-mariadb ClusterIP 10.102.33.53 <none> 3306/TCP 2d19h happy-panda-wordpress LoadBalancer 10.97.29.91 <pending> 80:31142/TCP,443:30121/TCP 2d19h kubernetes ClusterIP 10.96.0.1 <none> 443/TCP 3d22h ``` You see the 80:31142 and 443:30121 . It's read as <container port>:<node port> . So this service is mapped to node port 31142 for http and 30121 for https. You can further confirm this w/ kubectl describe svc <svc name> : ``` ➜ ~ kubectl describe svc happy - panda - wordpress Name : happy - panda - wordpress Namespace : default Labels : app . kubernetes . io / instance = happy - panda app . kubernetes . io / managed - by = Helm app . kubernetes . io / name = wordpress helm . sh / chart = wordpress - 16.1 . 18 Annotations : meta . helm . sh / release - name : happy - panda meta . helm . sh / release - namespace : default Selector : app . kubernetes . io / instance = happy - panda , app . kubernetes . io / name = wordpress Type : LoadBalancer IP Family Policy : SingleStack IP Families : IPv4 IP : 10.97 . 29.91 IPs : 10.97 . 29.91 Port : http 80 / TCP TargetPort : http / TCP NodePort : http 31142 / TCP <=== here Endpoints : 10.244 . 2.18 : 8080 Port : https 443 / TCP <=== here TargetPort : https / TCP NodePort : https 30121 / TCP Endpoints : 10.244 . 2.18 : 8443 Session Affinity : None External Traffic Policy : Cluster Events : < none > ``` Now w/ nodeport available, you could directly go to http://<any node's IP>:31142 to see the app. The IP could be any of the cluster nodes, control plane or worker nodes, all the same. The cons of this method is obvious — you need to keep a book of all the apps and their nodeport assignments. If an application is uninstalled and redeployed, its ports will change. This will be especially so if k8s cluster is used for CICD purpose because deployment happens dynamically in this case, thus port assignments would be quite difficult to track. Another con is that the number of apps deployed will be limited by the number of ports (default port range 30000-32267 ). This doesn't seem to be an issue for small footprints, but will definitely a scalability bottleneck for some good size deployment. Last, if each app is listenning on a nodeport, it creates a large attack surface in security. Essentially node/server must expose these ports. ingress w/ an external LB A better way is to deploy an ingress controller as a central gate. Ingress comes w/ more features such as telemetry so it's definitely the way to go. Install nginx, helm install my-ingress ingress-nginx/ingerss-nginx . Create a ingress.yml and create an ingress rule. The key is ingressClassName must be nginx , and backend.service.name be your app's service, in this case happy-panda-wordpress . Value for the host and path will be explained later. ```yml --- apiVersion: networking.k8s.io/v1 kind: Ingress metadata: name: wp namespace: default spec: ingressClassName: nginx rules: - host: wp.myk8s.local http: paths: - path: / pathType: Prefix backend: service: name: happy-panda-wordpress port: number: 80 ``` You can install kubectl apply -f , and delete kubectl delete ingress wp any number of times. No harm. I think behind the scene it adds a nginx rule and loads it automatically. Find the nodeport this ingress is listenning: kubectl describe svc my-ingress-nginx-ingress-controller . Now you need an external load balancer . This will be on your dev node using a nginx. Create a subdomain wp.myk8s.local in /etc/hosts w/ IP of .1 (this IP needs to be the IP this dev node on the cluster nodes' network). We are using this dev node as a LB and DNS. ``` # /etc/hosts 192.168.122.1 myk8s.local wp.myk8s.local ``` Setup LB. The upstream block defines the load balancing act. Default is round-robin. The key is server_name which must match the DNS record above. ``` conf upstream k8s { server 192.168.122.191 : 32536 ; <= = cluster node IP & ingress node port server 192.168.122.153 : 32536 ; server 192.168.122.172 : 32536 ; } server { server_name wp . myk8s . local ; <= = dev ' s location / { proxy_pass http : //k8s; proxy_redirect off ; proxy_http_version 1.1 ; proxy_set_header Upgrade $ http_upgrade ; proxy_set_header Connection \"upgrade\" ; proxy_redirect off ; proxy_set_header Host $ host ; proxy_set_header X - Real - IP $ remote_addr ; proxy_set_header X - Forwarded - For $ proxy_add_x_forwarded_for ; proxy_set_header X - Forwarded - Host $ host ; # disable caching add_header Last - Modified $ date_gmt ; add_header Cache - Control ' no - store , no - cache ' ; if_modified_since off ; expires off ; etag off ; } } ``` Now on your dev node, http://wp.myk8s.local . Enjoy. load balancing k8s document quotes this a way to expose a deployment. However, this is rather confusing because it's assuming a cloud provider who then assigns an external IP to the ingress controller. This is not how a home lab dev node will be! Then somewhere it says something about ingress controller being load balancer, or kubectl proxy being load balancer... ? Frist of all, there are three layers of load balancing: of the nodes, of service, and of the pods. Request hits the server/node eventually. Balancing the nodes. So between outside world and the k8s cluster, requests are balanced among nodes. This, of course, assumes these nodes being logically identical , which is exactly how the ingress nodeport can achieve! Perfect. We set up an external nginx to do this. This makes the nodeport of the ingress controller the only info exposed to the outside world. Balancing the services. Once the ingress controller receives the call, it uses the ingress rules to know which service this is for by using the hostname match, eg. wp.myk8s.local , then routes the call. Here, the usage of balance is different. You can spin up v1 and v2 of the same application but under different service name, then ingress can now be used to route some pcnt of traffic to v1 vs. v2. Of course, you could also spin up the same application over and over under different service name and have them routed/balanced , but I don't see a point here because of the next one. Balancing the pods. There are number of pods behind a service. k8s is doing the balance. So a call to a service will be automatically balanced among the number of pods behind the scene. This is k8s internal now, and is not of our concern anymore. Troubleshooting Reinstall Wordpress helm, service shows 503 unavailable First of all, helm uninstall does not clean up PVC! This is a known issue, and I have seen github feature request threads. I think the cause is the local storage I'm using in lab. After helm uninstall , the next helm install would show the web service can't connect to DB, and DB service shows no node have pv meeting its requirement. To clean this up: Clean up PVC: kubectl get pvc , then kubectl delete pvc <name> . Clean up PV: kubectl delete pv <name> . Recreate PV: kubectl apply -f pv.yml . In an extreme case, also login worker nodes and delete the static storage folders rm -r ... , then mkdir .. again. This, of course, will result in data loss.

It's usually quite interesting to listen to such a story, but I had a second thought. We all know the cliche that we are what we are because of all the previous days, hours, minutes and seconds, no more and no less, all combined, lump summed into this moment, so that I'm now sitting here writing these lines and having these thoughts. Without eating the previous 8 buns, the 9th one won't become fulfilling. A change of anything in history would then result in a butterfly effect that it changes the future, permanently, the unbearable lightness of being... So, with these in mind, there must be a chain reaction leading to the major even in focus, whereas every single step, regardless how minute and trivial at the time it took place, resulted in the final moment when the major even happened. Therefore, every single step is a cause ! We could argue that some steps are weightier than others, but they are nonetheless all causes . Therefore, we can pick any historical moment, and pick another one before it, and call it a causal! But wait a minute! Isn't this make a history, or any history analysis, a mocking joke? And if all causal become so casual, are there any point of building any causal relationship anymore? The bun analogy is actually a poor one because each bun is staged as the same (amount of food), which buns of history came in all shape and form and ingredient. It's certainly one view to name the 8th bun being the fatal blow of a historical tragedy, but wouldn't a view of naming the 7th chicken being equally valid? or the wine the hero drank when he was twelve!?..... This makes me wonder whether there is some clear rules of building a causal reasoning in general or in history in particular. Me: can one build a causal reasoning of any two historical events? ChatGPT: Yes, it is possible to construct a causal reasoning for any two historical events. Causal reasoning allows us to analyze and explain the causes and effects that connect events, even if they are seemingly unrelated. By identifying the factors and circumstances that contributed to each event, we can establish a logical and coherent understanding of how they are causally connected. However, the depth and complexity of the causal analysis may vary depending on the availability of historical evidence and the degree of scholarly consensus surrounding the events in question. So indeed. The difference lies in the strength of your argument, not whether you can or can not. You always can. Interesting. But, what about science then!? Isn't it the whole point of it is to build causal reasoning? Here is a snippet from wiki : We say a cause causes an effect if and only if there exists a 100% perfect correlation (positive or negative) between the cause and the effect when and only when all other possible variables are controlled for (a 100% degree of confidence). In these cases these effects are called dependent variables, and causes are called independent variables (so named because the dependent variable(s) depend on the independent variable(s), and the independent variable(s) do not depend on any other variable). It is possible, theoretically. But then, who determines that 100% !? Muddy.","tags":"thoughts","url":"https://fengxia41103.github.io/myblog/causal%20history.html"},{"title":"Fedex API generating label","text":"Fedex API is complex. A few things you want to watch out: When googling Fedex API, the top returns are usually 3rd API who supports Fedex. Not covered here . Always , use the test credentials and API endpoints for development. Switch to production when you are ready for production. Once you generate a test label, it requires a verification step by Fedex team. Email it to them and wait for approval. This is a human process I guess. It appears to be a micro-service architecture because each service gets its own API endpoint. This makes integration a bit tedious because each endpoint requires a different learning curve. Not for a faint heart. For label, use ship API . It's a long doc, but not difficult to understand once you get a feel of it. To generate a label, 5 steps: Get an authentication token from API Compose sender info Compose recipients info Set shipment method values. Many are enumeration values specified by the Fedex doc (they are in CAPITAL letters!). Call API. If successful, returning JSON body has: tracking number, ship date stamp, and URL to download the label PDF Get authentication token Once you create an account on the dev portal, you would be given a key and secret . Use these to get a token: def get_new_token ( self ): headers = { \"content-type\" : \"application/x-www-form-urlencoded\" } token_req_payload = { \"grant_type\" : \"client_credentials\" , \"client_id\" : FEDEX_KEY , \"client_secret\" : FEDEX_SECRET , } response = requests . post ( f \" { FEDEX_API } /oauth/token\" , headers = headers , data = token_req_payload , verify = False , allow_redirects = False , ) return response . json () . get ( \"access_token\" ) HTTP header Once you have the token, you need to include it in all the consecutive calls. Note that you must set x-locale . token = self . get_new_token () self . headers = { \"content-type\" : \"application/json\" , \"x-locale\" : \"en-US\" , \"Authorization\" : f \"Bearer { token } \" , } sender Two basic info to setup sender: address and contact .

These are the minimal info needed for my purpose. shipment = { \"shipper\" : me , \"recipients\" : recipients , \"pickupType\" : \"DROPOFF_AT_FEDEX_LOCATION\" , \"serviceType\" : \"FEDEX_EXPRESS_SAVER\" , \"packagingType\" : \"FEDEX_ENVELOPE\" , \"shippingChargesPayment\" : { \"paymentType\" : \"SENDER\" }, \"labelSpecification\" : { \"labelStockType\" : \"PAPER_4X6\" , \"imageType\" : \"PDF\" , }, \"requestedPackageLineItems\" : [{ \"weight\" : { \"units\" : \"LB\" , \"value\" : 1 }}], } call API Now we have all the pieces to call the API to give us a label. response = requests . post ( f \" { FEDEX_API } /ship/v1/shipments\" , headers = self . headers , data = json . dumps ( { \"accountNumber\" : { \"value\" : FEDEX_ACCOUNT }, \"labelResponseOptions\" : \"URL_ONLY\" , \"requestedShipment\" : shipment , } ), ) resp = response . json () # error if not resp or not resp . get ( \"output\" ): logger . error ( response ) return response In response, if successful, will be a JSON which has a master tracking number, a ship date stamp, and a URL to download label in PDF. The URL is by choice. You could also receive the PDF as a file directly, I think. But I think it's better to save the URL in my app instead of storing the file. Note that the URL expires after, I think, 48 hours? There is no harm to generate a new label. The unused one will be deprecated and has no charge. So in my case, I let the user to click a button on UI to generate label, put this request to a celery queue which in turn calls the API, then the URL is shown as a link on the UI, then user can download whenever. info = resp . get ( \"output\" ) . get ( \"transactionShipments\" )[ 0 ] master_tracking = info . get ( \"masterTrackingNumber\" ) shipping_date = info . get ( \"shipDatestamp\" ) info = info . get ( \"pieceResponses\" )[ 0 ] pdf_url = info . get ( \"packageDocuments\" )[ 0 ] . get ( \"url\" ) Seems simple!?

In its reverse, business also needs to generate PDF doc such as an invoice so we could email them to customer. Since these tasks are handled by backend and my backend is usually Django, it's important to figure out a general solution to handle PDF parsing and generation. Generate a PDF There are two ways to generate PDF: generate a HTML and print to PDF using browser, or generate a PDF in backend and (auto) download. The first one is universal. It has no issue of many of the quirks such as fonts. It's an WYSIWYG solution. The second one, on the other hand, is relying on xhtml2pdf , which comes a few things you need to know. Why we opt for one versus the other? In short, the printer solution is easiest but it keeps no record of a user's action. This is fine for docs such as manuals, instructions, those general-purpose docs. But in the visa business, we are passing onto prospective customers of some docs/forms that we wanted them to fill and used in their later application. Therefore, these docs, most of them, bear some customer info in the doc such as their name. For these we wanted to keep them as a track record of a customer engagement so that we know what have been sent to a customer. So the PDF, if sent, was saved. Therefore, it makes sense to let backend: generate the file → storage → link to customer's account w/ timestamp and other meta → customer downloads it (could be on-the-spot or a download link). workflow The general workflow is the same for both solutions because you are always generating a HTML version of the doc first. Therefore, in Django there is always a template, CSS and so on. The different would be that: templates: xhtml2pdf solution takes some additional CSS in order to work (see \"Asian fonts\" below). Printer solution, on the other hand, works pretty much as-is because the PDF is rendered as an image (I believe). So as long as the HTML looks right, the PDF will be fine. download/email: these are only available when using xhtml2pdf because backend now has the chance to handle different action depending on the function we want to provide. Printer solution has no control over the generation step, thus having no such capability. Asian fonts, inconsistency When using xhtml2pdf , you have to set to use these fonts if your doc is in Chinese. This, however, will make the generated doc looks different from the HTML version! I don't have a solution for this. Additionally, because of the fonts I had to enlarge some font-size as shown below in order to make them easy to read.

My basic setup has a pdf_layout.html which inherits a base.html . Then, individual PDF doc's template is inheriting the pdf_layout.html , mostly just now filling in different segments of contents based on the doc's purpose. Once you have these, prepare Django for the rendering: def pdf_visa_cancellation ( request , application_id , action ): application = Application . objects . get ( id = application_id ) person = application . for_whom context = { \"application\" : application , \"person\" : person , \"today\" : date . today ()} template = \"pdf_visa_cancellation.html\" # render html return render ( request , template , context ) PDF generator class First, we define a generator class as the engine. Given context and template , it would have enough info to generate a HTML. Then the filename determines the actual file being persisted in file storage based on the MEDIA_ROOT .

Here I'm using the py-pdf-parser . The trick mostly lies in the structure of the file itself that what you think the element should be isn't. There isn't a general solution to this. You will be dealing w/ a lot of data anomaly such as index of the info you want, empty/null data, matching data broken to multiple lines, things like these. The general capability of reading the doc in general is there. I would say it works 90+% of the time. Hey, if it could parse a Chinese-made PDF, I would certainly expect it to handle other (better structured) docs, better. import logging import re from py_pdf_parser.loaders import load_file from visa.utils.normalizer import Normalizer logger = logging . getLogger ( \"visa\" ) class MyPDFParser ( Normalizer ): def __init__ ( self , filename ): self . filename = filename self . doc = load_file ( filename ) self . data = [ el . text () for el in self . doc . elements ] def parse ( self , title , force_to_index = None , direction = \"below\" , split_index = 0 , delimiter = \" \\n \" , ): logger . debug ( \"-\" * 50 ) logger . debug ( f \"Parsing: { title } \" ) found = None # search full_list = self . doc . elements for el in full_list : if title in el . text (): if direction == \"below\" : found = full_list . below ( el ) elif direction == \"right\" : found = full_list . to_the_right_of ( el ) elif direction == \"above\" : found = full_list . above ( el ) break if found : # logger.debug([x.text() for x in found]) result = [ x . text () for x in found ][ force_to_index or 0 ] else : result = \"\" # cleansing result = result . split ( delimiter )[ split_index ] result = \"\" if \"/\" in result else result logger . debug ( f \" { title } : { result } \" ) return re . sub ( r \"\\s+\" , \" \" , result ) . strip () def parseByIndex ( self , index ): # TODO: no data!? if not self . data : print ( f \" { self . filename } : no data\" ) return return self . data [ index ] . split ( r \"：\" )[ - 1 ] def parseByKey ( self , keys ): logger . debug ( \"-\" * 50 ) logger . debug ( f \"Parsing: { keys } \" ) pat = re . compile ( rf \" { keys [ - 1 ] } \\s?[:：]\\s?(?P<value>\\S+)\" ) result = \"\" full_list = self . doc . elements content = \"\" for index , el in enumerate ( full_list ): content = el . text () if all ([ key in content for key in keys ]): content = \" \\n \" . join ([ x . text () for x in full_list [ index :]]) break tmp = pat . search ( content ) if tmp : result = tmp . group ( \"value\" ) logger . debug ( f \" { keys } : { result } \" ) return re . sub ( r \"\\s+\" , \" \" , result ) . strip () return \"\"","tags":"dev","url":"https://fengxia41103.github.io/myblog/python%20handling%20pdf.html"},{"title":"Fullstack deployment: nginx, dotenv","text":"Deployment a fullstack requires multiple special treatments . First of all, the overall umbrella is the separation of configs by the deployment targets, eg. dev/test/prod. Nature of these targets in practice are quite different. Here I'm identifying some common tasks. nginx.conf I use nginx for both the backend & frontend. It serves three purposes: serve static/media files, frontend (eg. bundled React), and backend proxy. http vs. https In dev it's usually a http, but in production it's always https . When using https, use this config. The key is the .pem which, if using Azure VM as the host, would have these key files already. If you are building your own host, you need to generate these .pem yourself. server { listen 8443 default_server ssl http2; listen [::]:8443 ssl http2; ssl_certificate /etc/nginx/waagent/TransportCert.pem; ssl_certificate_key /etc/nginx/waagent/TransportPrivate.pem; location .... } Assuming the .pem is from the docker host, you just need to mount them to /etc/nginx/... inside the nginx docker via docker-compose . proxy backend Main use of nginx is to proxy backend. Three pieces needed. First, define an upstream , which is the backend app itself. Here it's in a docker named web and on the docker's port 8001 : upstream django { # must be your docker host IP, `localhost` won't work! server web : 8001 ; } Second, in location / block, define try_files . nginx will try serve the request as much as it can, for example the static files, and will fallback to @proxy_to_app , then to 404 if all fails, cool! location / { .... try_files $ uri @proxy_to_app $ uri / = 404 ; <=== !! } Last, link proxy to upstream : location @ proxy_to_app { proxy_pass http : //django; <=== link to upstream proxy_http_version 1.1 ; proxy_set_header Upgrade $ http_upgrade ; proxy_set_header Connection \"upgrade\" ; proxy_redirect off ; proxy_set_header Host $ http_host ; proxy_set_header X - Real - IP $ remote_addr ; proxy_set_header X - Forwarded - For $ proxy_add_x_forwarded_for ; proxy_set_header X - Forwarded - Host $ server_name ; } serve static/media files You need two pieces for serving these type of files: root which defines the path on the file system where these files are stored, and location which defines uri pattern to match. root / var / www / html ; location / static / { autoindex on ; alias / path / to / another / place ; } location / media / { autoindex on ; } # root ONLY!! location = / { } # catch all domain location / { .... } Three things: Here root /var/www/html is telling nginx that the file system folder for storing these files is /var/www/html . This could be changed to any other folder one chooses. Now when serving uri /media , nginx will look for the file under <root>/media/ . This file storage value can be overridden using the alias per location. Therefore, as shown above, you could serve the static files from /path/to/another/place instead of the <root> . Further, you could capture value from uri regex, and use it to compose a path dynamically : location ~ &#94;/myapp/([a-zA-Z0-9_-]+)/(.*)$ { alias /var/lib/myapp/$1/static/$2; autoindex on; } nginx matches uri from top down, but will use the longest matched one. match exactly If you want to match a uri exactly , use location = <uri> . For example, location = / will match only the <domain>/ , not <domain>/user/1 . W/ this you could control exactly the nginx behavior. trailing slash Location ends w/ a slash. This is to force a permanent 301 redirect. This is significant when you define django URL APPEND_SLASH which is default to True . In other words, be consistent between your proxied django app's url and other urls in nginx, using either all ending slash, or not. For me I opt to use ending slash throughout. If a location is defined by a prefix string that ends with the slash character, and requests are processed by one of proxy_pass, fastcgi_pass, uwsgi_pass, scgi_pass, memcached_pass, or grpc_pass, then the special processing is performed. In response to a request with URI equal to this string, but without the trailing slash, a permanent redirect with the code 301 will be returned to the requested URI with the slash appended. If this is not desired, an exact match of the URI and location could be defined like this: ``` location /user/ { proxy_pass http://user.example.com; } location = /user { proxy_pass http://login.example.com; } ``` React .env If I have a React frontend, how to parameterize it so that I could deploy a frontend coupling w/ a specific backend but without changing code !? The answer is .env file. The environment variables are embedded during the build time. Since Create React App produces a static HTML/CSS/JS bundle, it can't possibly read them at runtime. To read them at runtime, you would need to load HTML into memory on the server and replace placeholders in runtime, as described here. Alternatively you can rebuild the app on the server anytime you change them. Note: You must create custom environment variables beginning with REACT_APP_ . Any other variables except NODE_ENV will be ignored to avoid accidentally exposing a private key on the machine that could have the same name. Changing any environment variables will require you to restart the development server if it is running. These environment variables will be defined for you on process.env. For example, having an environment variable named REACT_APP_NOT_SECRET_CODE will be exposed in your JS as process.env.REACT_APP_NOT_SECRET_CODE . So now I define .env.dev and .env.prod , and specify the backend's IP in it: # .env.dev: REACT_APP_HOST_URL = http://192.168.68.106:8003 # .env.prod: REACT_APP_HOST_URL = https://104.208.79.231:8443 Then in REACT code, I read this value in and provide it in a global context: import { createContext } from \"react\" ; const GlobalContext = createContext ({ backend : { api : ` ${ process . env . REACT_APP_HOST_URL } /api/v1` , host : process . env . REACT_APP_HOST_URL , }, }); export default GlobalContext ; Now, if to build a frontend coupling w/ backend at 192.168... , I do a symlink .env -> .env.dev , then npm build . This version of the frontend can then be deployed to any web server, and it will use use the 192.168.. backend. Similarly, if I build one using .env.prod , then I have one using the 104.208.. backend. With these, I have 3 benefits: Can build a frontend w/ any backend w/o changing frontend code. Can deploy frontend to any web server, eg. s3, nginx Can release and scale backend and frontend independently. docker-compose .env To define env variables in docker-compose such as DB credentials, you can either define them directly in the compose. The downside of this approach is that sensitive values are saved in git, and a dev using this same file but different value would have to make modifications directly, and usually these changes got checked in git also which then causes conflict. environment : HTTP_TYPE : http HOST_SERVER : 192.168 . 68.110 : 8003 PYTHONUNBUFFERED : 1 DJANGO_DEBUG : 1 # 0 or 1 MYSQL_DATABASE : chinesevisaexpress DEPLOY_TYPE : dev # dev or prod DJANGO_DB_USER : sldkjflsdj DJANGO_DB_PWD : sdkjflsj DJANGO_DB_HOST : db DJANGO_DB_PORT : 3306 DJANGO_REDIS_HOST : redis DJANGO_SUPERUSER_USERNAME : dlksjldlfjd DJANGO_SUPERUSER_PASSWORD : sldkjfljdslkj DJANGO_SUPERUSER_EMAIL : feng_xia41103 @ hotmail . com Or, you define them as key=val in .env , then docker-compose will read in automagically . You can check its effect by docker-compose config which is essentially a populated compose yaml w/ these values plugged in. # .env HTTP_TYPE=http HOST_SERVER=192.168.68.110:8003 MYSQL_DATABASE=ljlsjdlfkjlsfj DEPLOY_TYPE=dev # dev or prod DJANGO_DB_USER=sldkjfljs DJANGO_DB_PWD=sldkjfldsjf DJANGO_SUPERUSER_USERNAME=sdljkfldsj DJANGO_SUPERUSER_PASSWORD=dslkjfljdsl DJANGO_SUPERUSER_EMAIL=feng_xia41103@hotmail.com # docker-compose environment: HTTP_TYPE: ${ HTTP_TYPE } HOST_SERVER: ${ HOST_SERVER } MYSQL_DATABASE: ${ MYSQL_DATABASE } DJANGO_DB_USER: ${ DJANGO_DB_USER } DJANGO_DB_PWD: ${ DJANGO_DB_PWD } DJANGO_SUPERUSER_USERNAME: ${ DJANGO_SUPERUSER_USERNAME } DJANGO_SUPERUSER_PASSWORD: ${ DJANGO_SUPERUSER_PASSWORD } DJANGO_SUPERUSER_EMAIL: ${ DJANGO_SUPERUSER_EMAIL }","tags":"dev","url":"https://fengxia41103.github.io/myblog/fullstack%20deployment%20nginx%20dotenv.html"},{"title":"Dad trip","text":"First photo of the Earth taken by NASA in 1968 Finally, came back from this tiring trip. Having Dad in rest is a great relief. I don't feel the same level of hurt anymore inside myself. Though tears would still well when I think of him sometimes, but not as painful as before. I am glad that the scarf that Noah and I bought together are now blanketing him. Hope it will keep him warm, safe, and in peace. The trip was a tiring one. Friend said I was trying to pack too much into too late time. But they couldn't imagine how stressful and home sick I was towards the end of my stay in China. If I had many pleasure trips and good times on this land, this one made me sick. Meeting and catching up with friends were few highlights which made the trip warm, friendly, and worthwhile. But traveling was indeed a tiring business that you have to plan for which city you will go to, where to stay, how to get there, how to get to the city, the hotel, how to get around, and how to get back.... every a couple days you have to think of and plan for these. The stress of not knowing where you will a few days ahead troubles me. It's not the anxiety of planning but the general feeling of drifting that was exhausting. Then, adding on top of these, having to put off putting Dad to rest due to the stupid reunion my mom was going to was just too much for my patience and love. I wanted to be friendly and accommodating to her and her plans. But being so self-centered and caring so little of Dad and my feelings made me sick. Besides, Zhu's strong reaction of my plan of putting Dad to rest early made me angry. I respect her point of view, but I felt the argument was won only because I didn't want to completely alienate her for my mom's sake. It felt like a having a hostage in someone's hand, a feeling which I hate. It's probably a feeling of betrayal, also, that everyone seems to have an agenda running this as a show in which my Dad is nothing but a decor on stage. Everyone wants to at the center stage, but the real main actor, he, is brushed aside and couldn't be cared less as long as he, or should I say his ashes, is there when called for. This whole alluded idea of such a show sickens me. They criticized my plan of being rush and unconventional and so on and on... but they had no idea how agonizing it is that I had to go through the hellish weeks last May to sign off his death, then waited all these days to see him and be able to do something for him, even though this something is to bring his death to an conclusion. I knew what it would be like when so called ceremony takes place according to their schedule and idea. But it would be, and was, such a superficial one, that it shares nothing of the burden I felt on my heart. If sadness could be felt, it would have been silent. The silence, is what I think he should have for his coming home. Am I being selfish, inconsiderate? I say No. I hate superficial things, superficial people, and superficial tears. They are not even cheap, they are simply an insult in my eyes. phone number is the new SSN Traveling in China is a trivial matter if you don't have a local phone number under your name. The phone number is the new social security number over there. The logic train goes like this: your identity → phone number → bank account → wechat → 12306 or any other apps → you can use the service of the app. This other apps includes everything you could think of that involves someone at the entrance like a guarding dog. Therefore, the chain at work is like this: at the entrance of the service you want to use, a QR code → scan code will force you to install an app specifically designed for this service, only → after install, use wechat to SSO, grant whatever permission the app asks (you must agree , otherwise app installation bails) → generate a QR code → scan it as entrance or show to the person guarding the door → you can now use the service. This same sequence applies to all the services you would use in life: Buy a subway/bus ticket Buy a train ticket. I used Expedia for air ticket and passport was sufficient. Hail a cab Go to a museum, any tourist site including a public park Order at restaurant Buy a toilet paper at a public restroom It becomes insane, in my opinion, that anything starts w/ you scan a QR code which leads to either installing an app or a link to a website page. Either would ask for your granting a list of permissions to it eg. contacts, photos, and SSO w/ your money managing app such as wechat or alipay. I could understand requiring an ID to ride a train, but I am at limit why they need that to ride a subway. Out of the row of ticket vending machines, only one accepts cash, and only of denomination of RMB1 coin, or RMB 5 or 10 paper cash. Nothing else. Asking the girl at service desk to buy a ticket, \"go scan the code\". \"Can I break a 20 to 10s and 5s?\" \"No I don't have such service\". I had to break this insane loop by buying a bottle of sth from a convenient store w/ my RMB20 bill, use the coin change to buy a RMB2 ticket, drink the water at security check point, promise I won't drink it on the train, and used the other coins to help other locals who got stuck just like I was a few minutes ago. Insane, isn't it!? This is the reality that many were living through, but 90% of the people were happy about using the app, and we the minority group were left in the rust by technology wonders, and looked upon by others that we should be ashamed of ourselves coming out the public like this. The place is not a technically advanced, it is sickening, the sick of broadlight discrimination in disguise of technology, the sick of some developer who faithfully implemented a bullying requirement as if a German solider pulls a gas chamber switch because he was only following a command, the sick of designer of such system had little respect of people who couldn't manage the happy path , the sick of millions who jump through such man-made stupid whoops without complaints, and the sick of everyone else who felt nothing wrong of all these when they passed the door w/ their newly generate QR code. The whole idea, the whole scene, was sickening. This land is sick, really. It used to be one I enjoyed walking around, watching its change and progress, laughs at its silly english translation but feels warm of its efforts behind these mistakes... not anymore. It's a sick place full of arrogance, self-admiration, brag, indifference, and unkindness. At a noodle shop Ordered a noodle at a noodle shop. Giving the ticket to the chef. Took a seat waiting for my turn. Then three people came in. After giving the chef their tickets, two men stuck themselves right at counter window where chef would pass on the noodles. I had a hunch I'd better go to the window before someone hijacks my food. Just then the chef called out my noodle and I raised my hand to grab it. \"Excuse me!\" I said to the man who was literally blocking the delivery window and squeezed between himself and the window to grab my food. \"How come he orders the same noodle as mine!?\" this man was genuinely said that to my face to express his surprise \"Well, isn't this so hard to understand?\" I shot back. I was angry. What type of stupidity could it be that having someone order the same noodle in a noodle shop who has but a couple dozen on the menu to choose from!? What really annoyed me is that his comment wasn't of a surprise he felt of a duplicate order, but he was unhappy someone was ahead of him taking the noodle which he thought should be his despite there could be other customers before his order. So the bottom line of his logic is that he is the center of the universe the moment he walks in the door, that the entire shop starts churning for his food, and he should be served asap while no other in this roof matters. Calling this stupidity is an understatement. This, is pure, selfish that is bloated out of proportion, on a common ordinary guy who rides a electric scooter and eats a bowl of noodle for food. What gives him that idea!? He was like a fly nearly falling into my noodle soap, as disgusting as someone nearly put a finger in your food, and it was a too close a call. Nanjing, a city of \"mocking\" Nanjing was a pretty city judging by its trees along the streets. They wouldn't have grown to this size if not having a long history behind. But the entire city reminds me but one word, mocking . I felt sad if Dad could see what I saw. The white marble statue of Sun was covered w/ dark gray or black dust. No one who walked the room paid any attention to his words on the wall. They were more fascinated speculating a locked door behind the statue that his body, or treasure, is there. The entire tourist site only exists because of his status and death. Yet most of us, the tourists, acknowledging his greatness by paying the entrance fee, climbing the stairs for a good view, but of little to none of his idea, what his dreamed country should be like, and the dust on his statue. So he, as great as all the words has made him, is like a monkey on a chain, or a tiger in a cage, that the owner is interested in selling the tickets for money, and this monkey, now being a marble one, doesn't even need to be fed. How convenient. Same goes for all the other places of Guomindang governments ← the people who used to work there are villains, so they say, selling this country for whatever, but we love their beds, desks, living spaces, photos, anything, because they become tickets and $$... a show, a show of putting your enemy on stage to tarnish while you need to buy a ticket to get permission to throw the ink at him. What a mock, an ultimate insult!!!!? Great man!? Great man my ass. I have decided there and then that becoming a famous person would be the most shameful thing you could do to yourself on this land. It's worse than a cunt. It's worse than selling your soul to a devil. You would be selling your soul for a dollar a bush, cheap, trash cheap. The so called Nanjing forbidden palace has nothing left. Three elevated stages which would have been the foundation of the three great halls. Nothing left on them, not even a stone stool on which the grand wood beams would have been installed. On each stage there is a sign w/ words explaining the site's historical significance . But, seriously, I couldn't help laughing how BS this entire thing has become — this is literally, figuratively an emperor's clothes, use your imagination that this is the historical site, this is the greatness you came here to admire, but just a few line of modern prints are real, everything else, thin air. What is this!? Tourism of virtual reality? Then why am I here!? I don't know what to make of this. I can understand some relic sites would have nothing left physically but a site of ruin. But this one, I don't know, too virtual, or should I say, unreal, to be called of, anything, but an emperor's clothes, just like this city, a city of thousands of years of history, yet it could only produce such a cheap quality relics for its admirers. Guangzhou Guangzhou impressed me. Riding the subway at its rush hours were not as unpleasant as I would have expected. Though crowded, the cabin was quiet. Then, sitting in a basement Starbucks felt much like I were in Japan instead of a part of China — music was relaxing, not much shop noise, customers didn't come in w/ an air of brag, no one chatted in a loud voice. It was a nice break for me after the long trip of taking care of dad. Finally I could feel my heart was slowing down, my mind slowing down, and I could breathe. Walking into the narrow alley behind or between buildings were quite something. I don't know how people would live there, and how any public service such as post office, electricity, gas... how the hell could anyone manage such navigation!! I would be scared to knock on any door let alone asking for a payment, and do they even have a meter!? These places are \"a riddle wrapped in a mystery inside an enigma\". It felt like those tropical plants that had lived and grown on that spot over the years that it took over spaces, air, light, full of life while also full of suffocation. A part of the popular neighbourhood was under removal order so that many buildings were vacant, building left with half of itself, exposing entrances without a door, windows without a window, rooms without furniture or human, like a corpse cut open w/ its guts all exposed, on a display in a broad daylight. I think the city could use some cleanup. But then, I think those, later I learned a word, city village, is the trademark of this city. I'm not sure the ones I ran into qualifies for this term, but they were like nothing I had ever seen. Yuexiu park was nice. If Nanjing was a city of mocking, then here I found dignity. The old city walls, if they were real, are very well maintained and displayed. The enormous banyan tree w/ its roots biting into the wall reminds me the scene of Angkor Wat. I admire the wild lifeness of these tropical plants. They seem to burst open anything that confines its growth. As a man getting older each day I am jealous of such display of strength and energy, and even ruthlessness. Wondering around the city aimlessly. The street foods in a narrow alley next to a public toilet was just the feel I was seeking for. Sitting on a stool almost in a half-squat position, I was surprised to see a window of an apartment upstairs in a building across the alley filled w/ cute stuff animals. At first glance I thought it would be a store selling them. Then, I looked at it again and concluded that it must be a residential unit. So whoever lives there, in this kinda of a building jungle and wire jungle, kept a sensitive spot for his/her hobby. It's like seeing a wild flower blooming while you walk in the middle of a dessert. Second-hand electronics Walking into this, to me a nameless place, where second-hand electronic products are sold, I didn't expect to see so many small shops next to each other selling hi-fi speakers. They had racks of used amplifiers, most of them are not interesting at all, some popular names like Marantz, Japanese brands, McIntosh, but honestly they looked rather boring. The stacks of speakers, however, had no name plates I could identify, jumped to life when they were turned on. Happened to be walking by a small shop where one man sitting on the couch facing the speakers (and for the hell I tried I couldn't tell which set of speakers were on!), the music of Cain Qing was on. In a rather filthy building of such and a crappy small shop, the sound of her was memorizing! I couldn't say it was lovely, and certainly her song was picked, I would guess, mostly because of the movie, so that sense of following a known receipe is rather against my preference of the spirit of a 文艺青年 being different and unique. Yet, the voice was beautiful! Whatever the equipments were being used, the effect was surreal. Maybe the settings did provide a level of contrast, thus creating a wow effect. The boss looking man was jogging down a price quote so I would guess a deal was in the making. Still, I was impressed. I don't know how so many small shops within such a small area could survive. I suspect even that any of these shops, if they would turn on their stereo, would produce the same lovely voice as the one I just heard. So, it felt, just like many other businesses when a Chinese biz man gets involved, that a luxury, being it a beautiful woman or a brand name product, now sells, still with a hefty price tag, but lives in filth as a slave. Is it a good thing for consumers? I doubt. I don't like visit those expansive looking stores, but I don't like this settings, either. In both cases, I feel the seller is taking his products as a cold commercial goods, no warmth in it, it speaks of money, but has no connection of life. In contrast, stores in Japan, though selling used products also, made you feel it's a store who is proud of its products, which in turn creates the sense of trust that you, once walk out of the door, could still feel comfortable to come back. I don't know what it is. Maybe there is a version of human connection there, too, since I saw the potential buyer was comfortably sitting at the couch sipping teas, chatting and laughing. But there is always this sense of cunningness in those. I'm biased, maybe. Then, the little point-and-shoot digital cameras. Wow, I don't know how many of them have been revived. By seeing so many shops selling them I could only conclude there is a real demand for such thing. It felt similar when I saw the old flip phones were sold at the night market in Cambodia. But in Cambodia you knew they were buying them because they couldn't afford better. But here I think they are in demand because they fit in a life style, or an self-image definition, among young women I think, somehow. I don't know what it is. In the world of smart phone I really don't see why a woman is willing to carry yet another small electronic gadget which, in my opinion, provided little value in term of photography. Actually I didn't see many in action at all when I was walking around the city. But I'm sure these shops have keener sense of what is in demand than I do. Could someone enlighten me on this topic!? Cameras. Went to a well-known market, which turned out to be a whole district spreaded over a few street blocks, of camera gears. Just about 90% of the second hand camera bodies were Nikon and Canon. Other brands had little footprint, used Fuji, none, used manual lenses, few, m43 gears, some but certainly not a mainstream, exotic lenses or cameras, a few, but was not impressive, brands like Olympus, Lumix, few. Then, in yet another those massive shopping complex, each tiny shop has a repair station where one guy, yes always one guy, who might be owner of it, has all sort of broken wires, parts, what have you, of camera body and lens, and the guy was busy fixing something. I always thought repairing a lens is a rare skill. Maybe it is, but here you found a concentration of such skills, all appeared to know what they are doing, and his shop is testifying it being true. That is quite amazing! How did they learn this, I wonder, youtube!?","tags":"thoughts","url":"https://fengxia41103.github.io/myblog/dad%20trip.html"},{"title":"QR code","text":"Stuck at the ticket counter for 30 minutes while the battery is draining, network is not working, application refuses to download nor install, and ticket can't be processed until I show this stupid QR code! This, is the first taste I had on my real journey to China. Not only they need the Covid test certificate, but a QR code, which had no explanation of what this is, where to find it... counter clerks have a printed piece of paper which had a few code you can scan, which then brings up a browser with a download option. Then, my browser stuck for good 5 minutes and gave up, saying the site is unaccessible. Tried again, downloaded it again.. then it downloaded 10+ times.. then, finally I open the downloads, find one that the downloading is complete, an .apk file, then click to install... well, Google doesn't want to install it even though I clicked \"Install anyway\"... no, it won't install! Installed failed 5 times, and I was getting desperate at that point because the battery is draining fast now with these downloads and installation attempts. What to do? The clerks repeated the same feedback, \"do you have wechat?\".. yes I do, but then, what to do with wechat? So it's an application inside wechat.. but how to install that!? No idea. No help. In the end, asking my friend in wechat, you use the search to search for this app's name... but when searching \"China custom\", it showed me a whole bunch of links to articles and announcements!... so finally, the app is called \"china customs\", yes, with an \"s\" in the end.. installed that, wechat froze for a bit, then showed me a survey form.. ok, better... then, asking me the contact's name and phone number in china... didn't I already do this at visa application? I really don't know how many visitors could answer this without consulting some other wechat threads , but you can't! This app is nothing but using the embedded browser engine in wechat to display a survey, so switching to other threads will exit this app , thus making all the previously filled information, gone!.... is this wonderful!... so I had to just make up a number, what do u know!?.. see, this is when a good person turned bad, voluntarily. So in the end, after all these frustrations, it showed me a QR code, with timestamp good for 24 hours!? What does that mean? I'm healthy for the next 24 hours. So I'm supposed to show this code when arriving China, also, which makes me to think that we need to make this trip within 24 hours, otherwise I'm not qualified anymore..... wtf!? .... welcome, my ass.

Yea, Yokohama, a place I read so much about in books, but never thought I would visit it one day. I had no idea where it is until I looked it up last night, and wow, it's only 30 minutes train ride from where we are. Yokohama is pretty, really, and the building of Kanagawa University we walked in was super pretty. If one ever wants to see an upscale version of Boston, or any ocean harbor city, come here. And, if you like to watch ladies in suits, well, I guess any train station in Japan will be fine, but here you get the streamline version because of the big glass buildings and finance district, smells money, smells upscale, smells neat, clean, perfection, for their product, their men and women. Incredible. Maybe I'm a bit obesessed, but they are simply pleasant to look at. I can't help having a feeling that beauty in this society is too much of a consumable goods, that one, for being pretty and eye catching, is taken into this giant machine that will feed on it till the beauty is there no more. Some lucky ones find a good place in life so the styles could be maintained (there are many elegant mid-age that are truly memorizing), but the rest, youth is the one powerful drug, or the magic wand, that you could get anything you want, for a short while perhaps, then the body is being spitted out of this giant machine, like a waste... but how sad that would be if it were true. Yet, their beauty is so much like the cherries, indeed beautiful, breath-taking, 浮世. I thought the Gundam lab would be more impressive than that. The giant robot was cool to look at, but expectation led Noah to comment that \"it was underwhelming\". It's ok. Noah found his interest satisfied when we hit the rows of those \"egg machines\" — like candy machine, one puts some coins ($3 per pop), rotate a big dial till one egg shape package drops down, inside you find this cute little lucky charm. Noah spent a whole hour, and you could tell how excited this kid was. It was fun, and I have to say these charms are incredibly, cute. He snuggled a couple right into his backpack before showing me, the sole sponsor of this project. I knew he was saving those for himself. See, that's the small fun in a small life, no Gundam, no saving this planet or mankind, thirty dollars, one hour of time, 9 eggs in the end (and I'm not sure that's the real number, I think there are more), and he was happy.","tags":"thoughts","url":"https://fengxia41103.github.io/myblog/fun%20in%20a%20small%20life.html"},{"title":"Cherry","text":"Second day in Tokyo. Cherry blossom. It was a genuine surprise that we walked right into this shrine. I have heard so much of it growing up with the ideology, but seeing it is, different. Beautiful spring day. Watching the locals coming in groups, old and young, I could only guess that this is a spring weekend outing for many, like walking to a park where you would find the best cherries, nothing special, nothing heavy, nothing sad. The cherry trees are beautiful. Though I got just as much pedals in Cary as here, the trees here felt more, aged, fitting for the scene, fitting for the culture, fitting for the emotion. I don't know why, but I felt tremendous sadness. Spring breeze came from time to time, scattering the pedals as a rain. God knows how many phones and cameras were capturing the moment. People smiled, selfied, what a good life, but indeed cherry is like life, beautiful in some time, then, blown away. For the people who died in the war, or any war, by being believing in something so the mind could reconcile, it was noble, and it was tragedy. Put the ideology aside bah. A person needs something spiritual, something that is higher than this material world, something that is only within, that is, perhaps as fragile as these cherry flowers, but as pretty and memorable as them, too. May the wind caress your body, soul, be rest in peace, be remembered. Noah drew a lucky charm following three girls example, and got a 1st rate. For the first time in this trip, I felt he was connected with this land. After that he had been drawn to shrines. Watching him is like time travel, the young me, with futures ahead, and life ahead. I wish he would be feeling this spiritual side of things, sensitive, noble, beauty within, and without.","tags":"thoughts","url":"https://fengxia41103.github.io/myblog/cherry.html"},{"title":"2023 home trip freddie","text":"Where I'll be Date Location Best Way to Reach Me 3/29 on the road gmail 3/30-4/10 Japan gmail, text 4/11 on the road hotmail, Ann 4/12- China hotmail, Ann Contacts Name Email Phone Feng Xia fengxia41103@gmail.com 508/801-1794 Feng Xia feng_xia41103@hotmail.com Ann Zhang zhangny@gmail.com 508/801-8337 Ping Zhang pingtravel66@hotmail.com 919/345-0110 Bin Zhou lakerzhou@gmail.com 919/937-8470 Paul & Barb Ashdown barbashdown@yahoo.com 865/603-2232 Freddie medical Hospital: 919-967-9261 Address: 112 W.

She can make decisions. food Mix dry food w/ a bit olive oil in the morning Glass jars in the middle drawer next to the frig. New in bags in the trash can glider on the left side of the dishwasher. Amount: in general cover the bottom of the small salad bowl. Main meals: breakfast (7-8am) and dinner (5:30-6pm). Go with your own meal schedule would be fine. He will be begging for food as soon as you are eating. Light meals & snacks: lunch, after each potty run, and before bed (sometimes I just gave him some milk). He doesn't have regular web food. Once a while I give him cat food from Noah's place. That's his special treat. I usually give him my plate after I'm done, nothing on it but small pieces at most. I feel it's more of a ceremony to him that he is not left out of the whole deal. Otherwise, he seems not psychologically satisfied. He doesn't drink much. A salad bowl w/ fresh water. He likes water cold. He has no teeth left. So he can't chew. He loves bones. But only give him large ones so that he can't swallow to choke himself. potty schedule Every 4-6 hours, ideally. | 7:30am | 12pm | 5pm | 10pm | Adjust according to your routine. If leaving him home alone, I usually will shift his runs so that I could give him one just before leaving. He usually poops once a day, most likely in the first run or the last run. Always bring the bags. He does it twice in most cases, so you need two bags at least. After the first one, he may walk a little bit before he squats again for his 2nd shot. So be careful where you take him. I had once he did it when we were crossing zebra line, hahaha, awkward. places He is used to doing it on the sidewalk. So I try to move him at least away from shop front or crowds. But sometimes he did it right in the middle of the road (and stopped all traffic!! Imagine!!). The bushes by the church on Merrit Road (turn left towards Franklins if taking the west exit) is usually a good bet. The ones before the municipal parking lot right across street from our building front is another spot he will hang out and often does it. Other places vary. Bike racks on the west side of the building. If walking along Franklins, just about any trash can or parking lot pole or tree roots get his attention. I haven't yet figured it out what's so special about them. signs If in the morning, he would walk briskly once out of the elevator towards the side entrance. In this case he would usually do it right after getting outside. Sometimes I could move him across the street, but that depends. If he talks eagerly after seeing you coming home, he likely needs a pee. Sometimes it's a false alarm, but I have been giving him a walk nonetheless since it calms him down, also. Most of the times he is quiet, even when having accident. Watch out his water intake. He usually consumes a salad bowl of water per day. If he drinks heavily one day, be ready to have more frequent runs. If he starts agitates instead of lying quietly in one place, he needs a run. It's very much like a little kid. If he gets up in the middle of the night, chances are he is going to have an accident. accidents It's usually when I left him home for 5-6 hours due to my routine. Places vary. No patterns have been identified. Sometimes I wonder he was just not happy about the situation. Because of his size damage is manageable. I put hims bowls now on the rug so that he doesn't use that area for accidents anymore. He never did it in bedroom, nor near food including frig. Furniture wise the only case was by a chair's foot but never happened there again. Overall these are rare events. allergy/skin His dry skin is a concern. I have no recommendation. Giving him a warm bath helps to remove most of them. But they reappear. There are, sometimes, red spots around his peanut and he licks more than usual of that area. There is a prescription pad one can use to wipe the area. It helps. I have some of his allergy pills, too. I have also tried human allergy pills (half our dose every 24 hr) on him. No visible effect. beauty Warm towel to clean his face, especially around his eye area. Warm bath using shower spray and his shampoo monthly would be good enough. Shampoo needs to be on him for 15 min. He doesn't like head wet, but he cooperates well. I also give his feet and belly a rinse before bed. workout He doesn't walk far. He could, however, walk to the Bolin Creek Trail, just at his pace. The trail we went the most often is the bike/pedistrian trail by the railway track behind the carwash place. He gets hot in the sun due to his hair color. You could tell he slows down and starts looking for shades. In most cases, a slow walk around the building is sufficient for him. odd ends He doesn't like rain or wet ground. When rain he would walk close to the building where grounds are dry. You can make him go into the rain to do his business, however. Sometimes I would carry him to his place. If caught in a rain he manages fine, however. Sometimes he would walk as usual right after a rain. So it depends on his mood of the day I guess. He sings to a high pitch piano sound. So when watching TV or playing music, don't be surprised if he suddenly joins. One of his digits grows upwards. It may cause him some trouble walking, I suspect. There could be small pebble or odds stuck in his paw hairs. So please use the finger to feel them and remove if any. It must be uncomfortable. Don'ts Walk around any caktus!! His nose got pierced once, and his paw was pierced by a fallen spike once, too. Poor thing. Both times I was able to pull the needle out, but they were close calls. Nowadays I either pull him far away from them, or carry him passing the bushes so to eliminate possibilities. Mostly I worry the wound will be infected.","tags":"thoughts","url":"https://fengxia41103.github.io/myblog/2023%20home%20trip%20freddie.html"},{"title":"Nginx Https","text":"In my development this is a common scenario that I have a stack up and running on a server which has an IP but no domain. This creates a problem for getting a cert using certbot . Instead, on Azure VM there is already a folder called waagent which has a cert. So the idea is to use the same cert for HTTPs. First, define the django application as an upstream . Here the web:8001 is that the django docker service is named web (in docker-compose ) and on port 8001 of this web docker. upstream django { # must be your docker host IP, `localhost` won't work! server web : 8001 ; } Second, serve as the proxy for upstream django . This snippet lives inside a server {.... } . Here we define the location as @proxy_to_app , important!! This will later be used in redirect section. location @ proxy_to_app { proxy_pass http : //django; proxy_http_version 1.1 ; proxy_set_header Upgrade $ http_upgrade ; proxy_set_header Connection \"upgrade\" ; proxy_redirect off ; proxy_set_header Host $ host ; proxy_set_header X - Real - IP $ remote_addr ; proxy_set_header X - Forwarded - For $ proxy_add_x_forwarded_for ; proxy_set_header X - Forwarded - Host $ server_name ; } Third, the https piece. Again these live inside a server {...} . We are listening to port 8443 of the host server ( therefore, you need to add networking rules to allow port 8443 traffic by azure/aws !), and the certs are the ones I mentioned earlier which you can find in azure's vm itself ← this is the main trick! listen 8443 default_server ssl http2; listen [::]:8443 ssl http2; ssl_certificate /etc/nginx/waagent/TransportCert.pem; ssl_certificate_key /etc/nginx/waagent/TransportPrivate.pem; Fourth, catch all to redirect! So up to the section above, if you type in https://<ip>:8443 , you should hit your django app. If you ommitt 8443, for example, or typed http:// instead of https:// , this redirect will come into effect. Notice that it says try_files $uri @proxy_to_app; , and the @proxy_to_app is the named block of django app we defined earlier! So this is saying that any traffic hitting / (if not matched earlier because nginx matches url pattern in order) will be redirected to @proxy_to_app , just what we want: location / { add_header Access - Control - Allow - Origin \"*\" ; add_header Access - Control - Allow - Methods 'GET, POST, OPTIONS, PUT, PATCH, DELETE' ; add_header Access - Control - Allow - Headers 'X-Requested-With,Accept,Content-Type, Origin' ; try_files $ uri @proxy_to_app ; keepalive_timeout 0 ; } Last, any url pattern other than / should be put before the / block so to give them a chance to match. This is used for nginx serving static files such as media (your uploaded files) and css/js stuff. For example, here we are using nginx to serve /static/ and /media/ before it goes to the catch all / . Note that location must have the trailing slash !!!! location / static / { root / var / www / html ; autoindex on ; } location / media / { root / var / www / html ; autoindex on ; } location / { ... } So to piece all these together, this is a nginx.conf I use in production to serve https: upstream django { # must be your docker host IP, `localhost` won't work! server web : 8001 ; } server { listen 8443 default_server ssl http2 ; listen [ :: ] : 8443 ssl http2 ; ssl_certificate / etc / nginx / waagent / TransportCert . pem ; ssl_certificate_key / etc / nginx / waagent / TransportPrivate . pem ; location / static / { root / var / www / html ; autoindex on ; } location / media / { root / var / www / html ; autoindex on ; } location / { add_header Access - Control - Allow - Origin \"*\" ; add_header Access - Control - Allow - Methods 'GET, POST, OPTIONS, PUT, PATCH, DELETE' ; add_header Access - Control - Allow - Headers 'X-Requested-With,Accept,Content-Type, Origin' ; try_files $uri @proxy_to_app ; keepalive_timeout 0 ; } location @proxy_to_app { proxy_pass http :// django ; proxy_http_version 1.1 ; proxy_set_header Upgrade $http_upgrade ; proxy_set_header Connection \"upgrade\" ; proxy_redirect off ; proxy_set_header Host $host ; proxy_set_header X - Real - IP $remote_addr ; proxy_set_header X - Forwarded - For $proxy_add_x_forwarded_for ; proxy_set_header X - Forwarded - Host $server_name ; } } And the very last, to make the waagent available to nginx, we mount them in docker-compse , together with nginx config, static file folder, media folder: backend - proxy : image : nginx restart : always ports : - \"8443:8443\" volumes : - ./ waagent : / etc / nginx / waagent / : ro - ./ backend / nginx . prod . conf : / etc / nginx / conf . d / default . conf : ro - ./ backend / staticfiles : / var / www / html / static : ro - ./ media : / var / www / html / media depends_on : - web command : [ nginx - debug , '-g' , 'daemon off;' ] networks : - management","tags":"dev","url":"https://fengxia41103.github.io/myblog/nginx%20https.html"},{"title":"ChatGPT","text":"The ChatGPT is all over the internet these days. Had a long discussion yesterday, and it's becoming clearer and clearer to me that this is nothing but another hype, and I could say this is going to be a short one, too. NPR's view on this is right on the mark, I think, that chatgpt is a mirror of our past — in other words, it is \"perpetuating\" what we have said about a thing. In my word, it is a library or Google on steroid. It does make accessibility to these text easier, but it also highlight more and more that the bottleneck of this entire knowledge chain , which used to be bounded by the exclusiveness of text books and/or domain knowledge, are now completely determined by the limited capacity of human brain — just like so called drinking from a firehose, or giving someone your source code.. does it contain all the IPs you want to protect, yes, very much so, but it's also an illusion that anyone who possess this code would be now on the same footing with you who may have been working on it for the last 2 months or years. I think the hype around ChatGPT is yet another case highlighting how easily we are willing to discard the value of experience (not that I'm now older thus defending the value of so called \"experience\", but I have lived through enough positive & negative cases of this topic so to now understand why it is valuable and when it is valuable) in face of a shining new kid around block. while writing this I start to even wonder whether human as a whole is indeed the \"curiosity kills the cat\"? I used to think women in particular are vulnerable to this trait, but now with the technology waves come and go in the last few years — blockchain, AI, machine learning, now ChatGPT, I deep feel these waves are arousing the exact same reaction, which then leads me to believe the same reaction is a built-in character of these human... in other words, it is not the new drug is any better or worse than the previous one, it's that this drug causes the same kind of high , and one is relatively quicker to cause the effect than the other, maybe. So indeed what we are witnessing is not yet another technology which leads to the future. On the contrary it is a new drug on the market of which we, the opiate addicts, are now getting high from. Do we really care which drug to take if they are giving the same sensation in the end? And further, is then this new drug any better/worse than the other one? If looking under this light one would reasonable argue that there must be certainly a relatively position between the two, or any two, different offerings, whereas one represents a less risk to human, whether in the physical sense or spiritual sense, than the other one. However, this logic only holds when we discuss it within a boundary, for example, that these drugs don't kill me, or damage me to a degree is a health hazard. I know the threshold of the harzard is up to debate. Indeed, where we draw the line as being acceptable is the tricky shot, always. So along this line, if the two drugs can kill me in a equally measure, well, even on this aspect it's difficult to categorize the two being equal or not — think of the WWII's gas chamber in which Nazis created such a super drug which get a life eliminated in two seconds vs. some other ways described in classic literature. So it is, in this sense, better, a progress. But then, isn't it strange if two now develop a discussion that my way is better in killing than another? If you were given the task to do just that, yea it makes total sense and very practical and even necessary. But at the mean time we could present many other aspects of the same act that not only it's irrelevant one way of killing is \"better\", but the whole idea is simply, wrong! Now let's talk about the common scare that so and so will now replace your job. Doesn't it sound familiar? Of course. There is nothing new about such scare, historically or recent. I have had a bump year in my career, but I failed to see any connection between a new technology, new programming trend, and my job loss. Actually the fundamental logic train of such scare is simply wrong. The way it goes is \"If you have skill A, you will have a job; else, you don't.\" ... but this is a logic fallacy!!! Two problems here. First of all, skill A is not sufficient. There is logical guarantee at all that having a skill A will lead to a job. Plenty examples in life regarding this. Second, if we temporarily accepting that \"A → B\", then \"not A → not B\" will be true, \"I don't have a job because I don't have skill A\"... this is even more obvious than the original form... you could have million reasons not having a job, deficiency in skill A is just option on a long selection list. Many posts are titled \"ChatGPT will obsolete frontend engineering\", and examples of asking it to write a table, and viola, it gives back a nicely written React code which works perfectly. Great? Not at all. I have long argued that Google is as smart as the question you ask. Same applies here. If I could have broken down a feature in such a level of detail and described the intended implementation clearly, I bet I could have found a code snippet by Googling which is equally good as the chatgpt feedback. The so called search-engine-oriented programming is in play here. But, just like the piece you found in Google, you copy & paste it in to yours, run it, what's the odds it works out of box? In my experience, minimal!!!! ... just like I always question someone who pieces a few blog info together in a PPT and claims it will work because the blog says so!!!... the reality is much harsher than this. Copy & paste is nearly a given in today's engineering work. Not many people have the capability to reinvent the wheels , and not many's job need to. 99% of the people are integration engineers — they copy & paste code from here and there, and glue together in some fashion so that it achieves what s/he wants to achieve. Think of how many third-party code your project actually requires! I could safely bet that in any project these days, less than 10% of the final product is original , it can't be higher, and it needs not be higher. Integration is to say we are standing on shoulder of the giants, but the standing itself is much much more challenging than many realize!! So again, chatgpt's code requires my brain to read, to understand, and likely to tweak so it will fit into my legacy code, so the amount of workload my brain needs to take hasn't changed. Well, asking any programmer how s/he enjoys reading someone else's code? I mean, how many people even likes reading an operator manual? These example code are exactly that, a manual, that shows you can do this this way, but it guarantees nothing of its validity, and certainly nothing of its connection to your code (well, it doesn't know your code, doesn't it? So as cliche, it doesn't know what it doesn't know)... so these examples are absolutely nonsense! It equals to you ask a saint \"what I should do next\" without having him/her know anything about your situation... then this person just spills out an answer \"go west\"... how credible is that!? You gotta be insane to jump to action based on that. In 1 [this blog] I have reflected the value of technology — transparency, efficiency, and accountability. I think Google and ChatGPT has achieved nice progress in the first two categories. But we haven't done enough in the last one. I fear these tools are making too great a progress in constructing a positive feedback loop of information, but little in a negative feedback. And as a common sense of a positive feedback loop, such system is not stable. So, what will this society to become!?","tags":"thoughts","url":"https://fengxia41103.github.io/myblog/chapgpt.html"},{"title":"What is my value","text":"I feel anxious. Worked all day yesterday on the Chinese visa app, actually made some really good progress — I can now get data of an unsubmitted form in JSON, and even parse data out of a generated PDF! This is pretty wild! I never thought PDF could be parsed like this ← it's a combination of some structured format of PDF and some visual cue such as \"selecting the ones below this element\" which literally draw a box from this element down, and any element having overlap of this visual box becomes selected! Wild. But, I feel down today. Running into a neighbour's friend last night and this morning, the same lady who stopped me some time ago when there were a homeless w/ some mental issue lingering at the front door of our building, and apparently he stopped her that night, which understandably made her extremely nervous when I met her. She talked and talked, and I was only able to calm her down a bit by rubbing her back and giving her a few hugs. Then this time, the dog Maggie's mom was found on the floor of her apartment, and she called ambulance, and now Maggie's mom in an intense care and lost all conscience... sad, just sad. I don't even know their names, but news like this get me every time. I wonder, maybe deep down I'm feeling the anxiety of time and change that are so inevitable, that more and more I wish everything around, everyone around, would remain unchanged, unaffected, neither going up or going down... but that is not happening. Instead, faces I know are disappearing, or waning, or experiencing some hardships, which leads me to feel that the same hardships are coming closer and closer to myself... I think it's probably my character, that I don't like the slow process if I could already see the end of it. Almost like how I was working on this app yesterday, that I couldn't stop until I flushed out most of my thoughts, and while doing it, I had to ask myself to stop because I knew I was already tired and work was slowing down, but still, I couldn't. So in a sense I felt I was digging a hole for myself to jump in, an accident I planted seed to happen... and that is a terrible feeling, of myself. Even though I like the progress I made, and I know there are good values of these for the business, but I don't feel a strong sense of achievement at all. Instead, I felt I was repeating the same tricks I have done many times ← repeating the same \"what I already know\", only yet again jumping through all the hoops, and fell on the way coming... this is, tiring. I know I could pull through those unknowns , but to research, to experiment, to learn, is becoming very expansive, mentally, to me... I still enjoy figuring things out, but I dislike it at the same time, and the pull on the disliking end is becoming stronger and stronger. I guess fundamentally I'm scared. Laying off was mostly a relief. This makes me planning the trip much easier. But this also creates a dilemma because now any delay feels to be my sole responsibility ← before this I could have excused myself by quoting the work , the company ... anything other than myself would be at fault... but no more. Now everything is under my control , and I feel weak in front of all the todos, and all the things-not-yet-done. I hate myself being the slacker , or the coward who doesn't face these things right on. What should I do? It's easier to say one needs to reconcile with oneself , than done. 2023, so far, is a year of me feeling at a crossroad — on the one hand, I know exactly one thing I want to do — to take care of dad, and spend some time with mom. Then on the other hand, one depends on another, and I keep avoiding to look at this dependency chain and start from the bottom up. Coward. I feel tired, mentally, very much. The three years of working remote has created me a preference of being invisible, aloof, alone. This, just like anchors of life becoming less and less strong, then, with each person in life fades, whether this person is close to me or not, another line snapped, and now less and less those anchors are holding myself in the air, and I'm afraid that one day, when either all the anchors are broken, or a strong wind comes my way, it would have nothing to hold me down anymore, and I would be blown away, gone. Is this depression? Maybe it is. I'm scared, and I don't like myself being that way.","tags":"thoughts","url":"https://fengxia41103.github.io/myblog/what%20is%20my%20value.html"},{"title":"Job, and Da mama","text":"Left the company last Friday. The end came rather quickly. It was announced on Thursday's meeting, then got the call on Friday that the last day was then. Couldn't really tell I felt. It was expected, and the timing was rather strange because I was working with an agent on my Chinese visa so that I could start arrange a trip back home to take care of dad and mom. So rather feeling shocked or sad, it was a bit of \"now I could plan for the trip without obligation\" then. It's ok. I have seen plenty of such ups and downs, and going on this trip is the most important thing on my list. Dad passed away last May, and I haven't been able to get him to our family's resting place due to the stupid pandemic policy China has been following until recent. What a shame! So here we go. Now without the job to worry about, I could really think about what kind of trip I would like to have, and maybe this is a sign by fate, or by dad, that it's time to get mom's rest of life settled so that she could be safe and sound. Strange, isn't it, how life and timing work? I don't know. These days I constantly feel like swimming in an ebbing wave, not much control at all, just being pushed here and there, and trying hard to peddle, and sometimes doesn't even know why I still keep head above the water. I already lost a lot of sense of purpose and interest. Life is not only dull, but grim. It has little color in it, being both in the photos I take, and the reality I see. Future isn't better, either. I don't know. It's a depressing feeling I can't shake off regardless how hard I try. It's just, there. Adding to this, is the news that Da mama passed away. Had a chat w/ Da jia jia. It wasn't really sad, but it was still sad. She got to 101 years old, maybe that's good enough for anybody. Still, it's another person that I am familiar with, gone, no more, and that acknowledgment by itself is the root of sadness. Right before this whole Covid chaos I got to visit her at her nursing home on my 2019 trip. Haven't seen her for years, and have heard plenty of this legendary nursing place which Dad had plenty compliments on. Then, I took a great picture of her, sitting on her wheelchair, smiling, with wrinkled hand, and still wears her ring. She was cheerful as ever, though she had lost most of her memories also just like Dad. She could hardly recognize who I am after an introduction only a minute ago. But she was talkative, and had a quick wit as she has always had. Dad at the time wasn't doing well already. So watching her makes me wonder how a person farewell in a life — she had plenty hardships in her life, and she kept her head high; Dad had his share of pain and stress, and he did alright. Then he quickened the pace and overtook her in this aging process, and went ahead though he is 15/6 years younger than she was. How strange life's plan really is! What's the purpose, or the reason behind all these? What determines a person's time when his/her time is up? ... in the end, both could now be counted as part of the Covid statistics, and I bet neither of them had any such plan in life. What a joke! Dad would have scorned on such idea, and she, probably would have made some fun of this as her humor always did. But in a sense they are now meeting again, on the same page, at the same line, and in the same world. Farewell, Da mama, and dad. I hope they all like the place there. Now you could talk to each other again in your Shanghai dialects, and find each other's thoughts comforting and calming. I will miss you, Da mama, and I think I already do. Go cheer my dad, and make him laugh again. Tell him I miss him very very much. If only I could know that you guys are all doing well and happy there.","tags":"thoughts","url":"https://fengxia41103.github.io/myblog/2023.html"},{"title":"Nihilism","text":"Nothing is better than hiding in my little dark room and reading a book w/ a cozy blanket, and that's what happened yesterday. But the topic is rather a bizzare one, to my regular taste — information technology and its effect on politics, in particular, of the future of democracy. Written in 2014 and added one more chapter at the end in 2018, the book reads like a prophecy w/ hindsight of Trump and insurrection. The point is this — w/ the spread of the mobile and the Internet, social elite is losing credibility because they lost the monopoly of information. What used to be a top-down information flow whereas all walks of experts, authorities were the final saying of his/her particular field are being toppled because, inevitably, their sayings are full of loopholes, which have always been there, but the public has little access to any alternative reference/information to discover, let alone to challenge. This echoes mine perception, which I have joked w/ in many occasions, that Noah and his generation have all the equal advantage of using Google as much as I do, therefore their access to so called information is on par w/, if not even superior than, mine. What this leads to is that the traditional foundation of me being an authority of whatever a topic to him, now he has vast other channels to either prove or reject my version. Now the curious thing is that. With such a challenger, you would think the sayer, or those authoritative figures, would be more careful w/ their words, w/ more homework and evidence behind the scene so that they could sustain such challenge. But this is making an assumption on the sayer's nature that s/he is a responsible person, meaning that s/he feels bad, embrassed, if they were challenged and eventually proved wrong. But apparently such an assumption of human nature is way too optimistic. Instead, what we witness at the moment of China speaks loudly of what a person, a group of persons, or an name tag you would use to describe this lump sum of bodies, heads, the public, the mass, the people, are capable of speaking, and believing a non-truth, in a broad daylight, unshamed, unembarassed, and many times eagerly, and sincerely. Let's leave that topic for now. What I want to discuss here is another thread which I found quite interesting — nihilism . This is about Noah. Now w/ them having access to what used to be a monopoly of information, like the Reformation , commoners are now in position to challenge the status quo. But the challenge itself doesn't mean they are always right. This is why I used the word information deliberately above instead of knowledge . I still believe age, experience and education give a person the edge of translating information to knowledge. With both of us having the same access to Google, my knowledge, or should I say my capability to assemble information, distill and discard bits and pieces, so to supplement my existing knowledge and/or learning a complete new one, is still stronger than Noah's. I have no doubt of that. Given another 5-10 years till he reaches post-college, I also have no doubt his processing capability is going to surpass mine, probably indefinitely. But again, having a laptop next to a powerful server, there is nothing logical about the programming running on the laptop is definitely inferior to a one running on the server ← it's the quality of the software that is more important than the sheer processing power of the CPU. Likewise, drinking from the same Internet hose, education, reading, thinking.... all these soft skills determines the quality of knowledge . So, what does this mean? I think there are two aspect of this. First of all, with visibility to some of the hidden information due to this technology age, more brains are being activated so that more are indeed in a position to challenge, and this leads to the nihilism ← a strong motivation to reject what we have today, but the key feature of nihilism is that it does not provide the alternative ← it is not constructive. Taking it to an extreme, it is actually destructive, and can even be confused w/ being revolutionary (but it is not! I'll explain later), because its thrust is at crossing out the present, and even the past (think of how we get to the present if not because of the past !?), but isn't much interested in analyzing the root cause, thus isn't deep enough to provide a step forward. This description definitely reminds a young kid that when the parents are asking \"do you want some eggs for breakfast?\" \"no\" \"how about milk?\" \"no\"... but it's a much harder question if to ask \"so tell me what you'd like to have?\"... the barber I used to go to in east Boston, I remember he quoted his experience visiting his grand daughter one time, the mom kept asking the 2-year old what she wanted for breakfast, and he said \"that's just crazy! What does she know about it?\".... it sounds very much politically incorrect these days :) we can't dismiss a two-year old as if s/he doesn't know, or even think, but we also see that there is a grain of truth in such a rant. After all, no parent sane enough would listen to a two-year old for a driving direction, or even give whatever the kid wants to eat, because all parents know by life experience that the kid at that age is willing to put anything into his/her mouth w/o a blink. So here we are, at the early age of information technology, the public are just like a two-year old. On the one hand we start to get a sense of this world which were foreign to us without such an infrastructure. Then on the other hand we are still no in par w/ those authorities who, like a parent, used to know more, if not know all. So, naturally we are entering a rebellious phase ← sometimes I wonder, the teenage rebellion is the same symptom of human being arrogant in face of nature — we sometimes are firmly believing in our ability to navigate, to change an existing order, but many times prematurely, and that leads to this nihilism — I don't like what I have, but I fail to answer what I want. Second, because challengers themselves are often over-estimating their knowings, I believe there is still room for elites, experts, or anyone who holds a deeper thought of a topic. In other words, nihilist, though massive in numbers now, are more likely than not to be only able to scratch the shallow surface of things, even though s/he may feel a keen interest in the topic/agenda. To propose an alternative, or should I say a good alternative other than the status quo, requires a much harder understanding of the problem, and that learning experience isn't pleasant at all. In other words, in order to be constructive, one would have to have intimate knowledge and some philosophical thinking of the likes & dislikes, and that, like becoming good at any sports, requires training, self-discipline, and is an experience mixed of fun & agony. Browsing the Internet makes casting a net wide easy. But that does not replace you knowing where to cast the net so you could harvest fish. Not to mention that you, if taking yourself as now the captain of your own ship, you need to know your fish's habit, kind, market price, how to preserve them afresh, navigate the map, battling a tide/storm, managing crew, fixing boat as you go, and on and on and on.... so, just because I could watch all the majestic mountain climber youtubes makes me nowhere closer being able to climb the least challenging hill next door. Now I start to understand why there is a profession called \"professional agitator\", those whose career was to start a revolution. These people are more than a nihilist. Instead, they offer alternative, and sometimes have a viable way to achieve that, though their ways is paved w/ blood and death. The saying that you could draw the best picture on a piece of blank is nihilism ; the saying that giving God your property and your soul is saved is religion. American politics, as a mirror of its residents' sentiments, have truthfully reflected the teenage-type nihilism, so that Trump and the 1/6 flattered themselves being revolutionary, but they were but nihilists — they don't like eggs and milk for breakfast, but that's the end in itself. If not the current system of democracy, or whatever the name you'd like to use, then what? If not the current voting process, then what?... alternatives seem abundant, I would say, China? Cuba? North Korea? Congo? Singapore?.... name one, any, then make a poll of the American public again, or vote (then ironically isn't this is the same process we don't like!?), see what's the choice. Personally, I don't see an alternative. Not that I like what we have. I truly believe the current two parties are both, not inspiring. But they are still better than China's. Zhao said to me when we were discussing a similar topic on Beijing street one night, \"capitalism isn't the best; it is the least evil\". What America has is indeed the boundary of human's thinking in term of governance. Just like a boundary in physics, it's not an intrinsic sin being the boundary. Rather, it's offering itself to be proven wrong. Therefore, its appearance of being broken or unstable is a given, and in my opinion, is its strength. Nihilism is actually a cowardice. I don't advocate struggle in life being a virtue, but I totally dismiss behaving like a 2-year old saying \"no\" as the only answer.","tags":"thoughts","url":"https://fengxia41103.github.io/myblog/nihilism.html"},{"title":"white paper","text":"The news clip of Shanghai's protest was a surprise when I first saw it yesterday morning. But I couldn't help feeling the emotion charged in the air, and the excitement after that has been now injected in my body. For a full day and night I couldn't really dismiss the images and thoughts, and earned to view news over and over wishing there were more development becoming available. Sometimes I even felt an urge to be onsite just take some pictures. I don't think I am keen on any political agenda if there were any. But the manifest of human emotion after such a long depression, whether labeled under the covid or not, finally erupted and, heard , is contagious and touching . Maybe it does speak to still a thing in my body, a thread of youth maybe, that revolts for unfairness, asks for kindness, and leans to support the weak, the vulnerable, the suffered — a voiceless face, a facelss name, a nameless victim. One couldn't have chosen a better totem than a white paper. It can be interpreted in so many ways, and is so well echoed w/ the Chinese culture & history. Easily it's a symbol to protest the censorship that no criticism is being shutdown w/o mercy and exception. It's also a history when the Empress Wu put up a tablet for her tomb w/ no words on it — I vividly remember the story when data told me of this, I was just about Noah's age now, that she thought her achievement were too great for any words to capture, or, wasn't she fear of controversial postmortem? So this piece of paper also signifies the anger and emotion the beholders had, which, in many ways are too overwhelming to be in words. Or, didn't this party started by preaching that the best picture could be drawn on a blank page? So they were using this line to justify their ideology of smashing all the olds to make way for the \"new\", which they themselves staged to represent. But of course in the end the olds were smashed alright, but the new turned out to be indeed something new — some new ways of repeating old crime and new methods to create old misery. The powerful are still beyond law and moral, and their biggest interests are to shut off eyes and ears, and numbing heart and soul. Surely blank paper is a clean start, but social life has no reset button. I don't know any possibility to create such a blankness without extincting the life off this piece of land, or should I say, yes there is such blank paper, so will be the after effect of its creation — a lifeless void. Holding up this paper! Yes let's hold this aloft! In a kid's hand it's the raw ingredient of an airplane. So it's also the seed for a spirit to ever gain a pair of wings so it can fly, high and free.","tags":"thoughts","url":"https://fengxia41103.github.io/myblog/white%20paper.html"},{"title":"REACT in website","text":"This is to answer the question of \"how to use REACT with your website?\" For example, I'm using Pelican to generate this blog site. These are static files. So if I want to utilize my REACT skill to write some web application , how to incorporate that into this website? The idea is straightforward — REACT is a Javascript. So, if I can package my REACT application into a .js , can't I just import it using the <script... HTML syntax? Yes I can! The key is rollup.js . So the idea is this: rollup will package your REACT files into a single bundle.js , and you import it in your HTML. The connection between REACT code and HTML page will be a HTML id . React component Use my quote.jsx for example. In here I define the REACT component however I will do: import React , { StrictMode , useState , useEffect } from \"react\" ; import { createRoot } from \"react-dom/client\" ; import fetchJsonp from \"fetch-jsonp\" ; export default function QuoteBox ( props ) { const [ quote , setQuote ] = useState ( null ); const [ img , setImg ] = useState ( null ); const [ loading , setLoading ] = useState ( false ); const getImage = () => { setLoading ( true ); // AJAX const min = 1 , max = 1743 ; // 1743 is from manual testing const id = Math . floor ( Math . random () * ( max - min ) + min ); // NOTE: must use `https` if using github page, which is // served in https (is a setting option, however). const apiUrl = `https://dynamic.xkcd.com/api-0/jsonp/comic/ ${ id } ` ; fetchJsonp ( apiUrl ) . then (( resp ) => resp . json ()) . then (( data ) => { setQuote ( data . title ); setImg ( data . img ); setLoading ( false ); }); }; useEffect (() => getImage (), []); return ( < div > < figure onClick = { getImage } > < img src = { img } className = \"center img-responsive\" /> < figcaption > { quote } < span style = {{ marginLeft : \"1em\" , float : \"none\" }} > < i className = { loading ? \"fa fa-spinner\" : \"fa fa-angle-right\" } style = {{ paddingLeft : \"1em\" , marginRight : \"1em\" }} >< /i> < /span> < /figcaption> < /figure> < /div> ); } Then at the end of this component, I must use createRoot to add an element to the DOM, thus making this component's render appear to the HTML page. The getElementById(\"quote\") is where this component will be put under. const rootElem = document . getElementById ( \"quote\" ); if ( rootElem ) { const root = createRoot ( rootElem ); root . render ( < StrictMode > < QuoteBox /> < /StrictMode> ); } HTML element Next, in my .md (Pelican uses .md to render html ), all I need is an element w/ ID \"quote\" . Apparently now I can plug in the component above to anywhere in the page, so you can make some really neat component and plug it into your running text to make the page interesting. Title: Quote Tags: quote Slug: quote Author: Feng Xia <div id=\"quote\"></div> rollup Now enters the rollup . First is its config. Two key values: input: \"index.jsx\" , which defines the list of components we are to package, and output: \"bundle.js\" which is the final package name we are to import in HTML. import serve from \"rollup-plugin-serve\" ; import livereload from \"rollup-plugin-livereload\" ; import babel from \"@rollup/plugin-babel\" ; import { nodeResolve } from \"@rollup/plugin-node-resolve\" ; import commonjs from \"@rollup/plugin-commonjs\" ; import replace from \"@rollup/plugin-replace\" ; export default { input : \"index.jsx\" , <==== !! output : { file : \"bundle.js\" , <==== !! format : \"iife\" , sourcemap : true , }, plugins : [ nodeResolve ({ extensions : [ \".js\" ], }), replace ({ \"process.env.NODE_ENV\" : JSON . stringify ( \"development\" ), }), babel ({ presets : [ \"@babel/preset-react\" ], }), commonjs (), serve ({ open : true , verbose : true , contentBase : [ \"\" , \"public\" ], host : \"localhost\" , port : 3000 , }), livereload ({ watch : \".\" }), ], }; Now in the same folder w/ this config file, you need an index.jsx . This doesn't need much explanation. You can put components in a different file structure also, or even make them like a storybook kind library, and import the ones you need here. import QuoteBox from \"./quote.jsx\" ; import SearchBox from \"./search.jsx\" ; import PresentationBox from \"./brother.jsx\" ; Next, let's roll these components into a single .js : npx rollup -c js/rollup.config.js -w . You should now see a bundle.js in the same folder as the config. use bundle.js in html Last step is to import this bundle.js in HTML. Really now you can serve this bundle.js from anywhere. It's just another JS. < script type = \"text/javascript\" src = \"{{ SITEURL }}/theme/js/bundle.js\" ></ script > Now once the page w/ the given ID is rendered, JS will take effect and insert the REACT component to that spot. Neat.","tags":"dev","url":"https://fengxia41103.github.io/myblog/react%20in%20website.html"},{"title":"Saturday swimming","text":"Noah's swimming training is going well. Though the kid struggles from time to time, he has been in this and didn't skip much. After jumping in the car reluctantly this morning, he started to talk soon after seeing the figurine I put on the dashboard, and was in a good spirit shortly. This, actually is pretty rare, and I felt glad that he is indeed growing up and being more and more behaving like a, grown up? I don't know whether I really like to him to grow up already. Sometimes listening to his audio saved in wechat I missed the little boy I knew. He is not a little boy anymore, which I'm both grateful and wishing otherwise. I guess that is the dilemma of a parent, wanting them to grow up quickly, being happy for each step forward they are taking, but also want them to stay little because then they would continue to be attach to you, and need you. Soon he will become independent more and more, like driving himself to places he wants to go, and even the role of a driver these days won't be there fore me anymore. Sitting here at deck and watch him diving into the water is such a bless, especially after a long week of endless working. I know sometimes it's tough for him to keep on such routine, but I'm hoping this will help him to find himself, knowing himself, experiencing some ups and downs, and in the end becomes a strong person that he could then enjoy this life with a good health, a good spirit, and a good heart. China's so called big meeting is official over, so is the fate of this nation. It's disheartening that an entire society could swing back to its old course so quickly. One would have imagined that the momentum of the last three decades would be hard to stop. After all, isn't there such as thing as inertia and old habit die hard? But apparently not much so. Old habit die hard, indeed. The old backwards thinking of having a strong man leading to victory hasn't died in the face of progress. The boom we saw a few years ago was but a small deviation of course of the old habit. People living in it at the time thought it would have been that forever, just like people living in those terrible 10 years would kill themselves because they felt the same way. I found it curious how easily a person could be influenced by these macro environment and in turn lost themselves. For me it was obvious all along that there had been signs, especially incoherent signs, that made the story don't add up — how can a top tier mall hosting all the world class names having a smelly bathroom? how can a person in uniform freely stop me walking in subway station for ID as if he were entitled and I was belittled? how can a business discuss always ended with \"you don't understand China\" \"we have out characteristics\"? how can elites standing on stage talking about 弯道 超车? how can everyone be millionaire because of real estate as if any land is now worth a fortune (doesn't the entire Earth is by definition, a land? then why there is poverty, poor country, poor people?)... These didn't add up, never did, but people living there, or I should say, people who were beneficiary of this made-up-explanation, didn't want to see them. They convinced themselves, based on their person experience of fortune, that these incoherence were just imperfections in a world of perfection. Like the word \"chinese characteristics\", is a silver bullet to explain anything. After all, it can't be proven otherwise, true or false. So in the end, I see this consistency in human nature of make-to-belief, that a person is always choosing to believe what s/he wants to believe, and it is completely detached from what the fact could be. Therefore it becomes important what this person's system of belief could be. I mean, it's not about what religion he picks up. But rather, it's about a systematic tendency of what he is likely to be drawn to, just like someone is drawn to spicy food while others to dessert. There is certainly a grain of this at birth, but the life experience, education, and what you see and hear daily, so called propaganda or brain washing, makes up a large portion of it. Once such tendency is part of you, old habit die hard.","tags":"thoughts","url":"https://fengxia41103.github.io/myblog/saturday%20swimming.html"},{"title":"Social invalids, birds","text":"Morning walk w/ Laifu, and found another small green bird lying on the sidewalk, the same kind I found the night before. I couldn't tell whether it is the same one. At a moment I felt this could be the same family that one was lost going out and never returned, then the other flew out here to look for it, then bumped into this glass building and suffered the same fate... I felt sad. Picking it up and brought it to the same spot where I left the other one. The one I left was gone, making wonder whether the cats got the bird, or they picked it up and brought it back to the sidewalk where I saw it again? Don't know. It's a warm feeling, however, seeing there are a lot of dry foods for the cats, and a few containers of different kinds lying around, and a box of water... some kind person is taking care of these cats. I don't know where they are hiding. Wherever it may be, let it be safe, warm, dry, and cats could live there without hardship. Saw the same guy lingering around the building under the bus stop hood. I don't know what is of him. He is not a valid anymore. Morning temperature is down to the 50s now. He doesn't seem to mind. The lady I ran into the other night who said this same person was blocking her from coming into the building and got scared. She was really shaky. I felt bad for her, too, and I felt bad for this invalid. Doesn't he have a family? or friends? Police was called the other night by the lady, so I would have thought he was taken away and put somewhere by the police. Quite a surprise then seeing him again this morning at the same spot as if he never left. Maybe police doesn't know what to do with him, either. What do we do with such invalids then? I mean, as a society, there is bound to have someone like this, either they lost mind voluntarily or accidentally, they become the person they are now, and their body is still going while their mind is completely gone. What should they be? Makes me think of the experience with Dad when I first took him to Taikang, also. It was my first time being with all the dementia patients, men and women, some easy to tell while some are superficially as normal as you and I. I didn't what to do w/ them, either, and many turned out to be just another living being, though not as understandable as so called normal people. But living up this age it is challenging for me too to call a normal person normal just because s/he is not yet as an invalid. There are plenty of walking zombies whose mind is not anywhere more healthier or admirable than these invalids. But no one picks them out. If human difference is really a difference of opinion, then wouldn't it be reasonable to take the invalid as just another kind who might be living in a parallel universe now of which we know nothing about? I don't know. I feel bad for this guy. He is lost apparently, lost in this world. Worst of all, he is doomed to be lonely. No one is willing to talk to him, getting close to him, and even being nice to him. He is a social outcast in the same sense that some back in the Victorian age committed a shameful sin. We know those so called sins come and go, each age following a different set of standard to judge. Yet, for these invalids, they are just forever gone, crossed out already, and the world is only waiting for him to perish. Sigh. The bird lost its way in the glass jungle, and this person lost his way in this human world. Different being, same fate. Sad.","tags":"thoughts","url":"https://fengxia41103.github.io/myblog/social%20invalids.html"},{"title":"Swim meet","text":"It's a strange feeling that you got a text from a total stranger, and it turned out we could chat like old friends as if there is indeed a parallel universe and somehow we connected. She is a very pretty person, and I sincerely wish she has a beautiful life, also. Maybe one day we will meet in person, but it indeed feels like a destiny of some sort. Taking Noah to his swim meet today. I don't know what happened to the sweet boy I know. I don't think I am doing a good job now as a dad, and I don't think she is doing a good job as mom, either. He turned into a person that is constantly unhappy, and is actively avoiding me. I don't know what I did that is turning him away. There must be something. But this feeling is annoying on my part. I hate to show up at his door only to see him unhappy and unwilling to see me. I wish my being there would be viewed as a good thing, not that I get up early in the morning just to frustrate him. The quirky thing is that he isn't happy either when being with his mom. So, what is going on? Once a while we get a nice conversation, usually after his swim training, as if he has let out all the steams in the training, now could be more relaxed and have a talk. I cherish those moments. But still, I wish him happy, w/ or w/o me. If me staying away is the key, then be it. But so far I think himself is confused, and he doesn't know what makes him happy at all, so just venting on me as if I were the fault. Oh well. Swim meet is a thing of joy. It's like a town party. Even kids are walking in w/ a lawn chair as if they are going to a picnic. And watching these little ones kicking and splashing is simply, wonderful! What a beautiful thing life is! Being young and healthy and full of energy. Sometimes I feel life is indeed short, that the best years of your life are only that many, and they just fly by. Then you start the looooong years of being old, being weak, being not of your top form, and only watching yourself deteriorating day by day, and what an agony that is! I know these kids don't know that yet. It is a fate of human nature that you would realize only when it is there no more. I guess this also speaks of the theory we learned in finance that a loss hurts more than a gain does for the joy. So the feeling of a loss is etched deeper. This also explains that Dad was relating all the unpleasant memories even then he had lost all the chain of reasoning. So safe to bet that sweet memories are far and between, if any left in the end, whereas bitter memories stay. What a pity.","tags":"thoughts","url":"https://fengxia41103.github.io/myblog/swim%20meet.html"},{"title":"Feeling down","text":"Haven't written anything for a while. I had moments that I felt I wanted to say something. But those moments were all moment of sadness suddenly hitting me — they made me miss zhuzhu, miss dad, and started to feel, lonelier and lonelier in this world when all these lives dear to me are passing away. It felt like cutting strings that are attaching me to this world, and I'm afraid that when more strings were cut loose, I may snap one day, because there really isn't much I couldn't put down anymore. Even Noah is growing up, becoming more and more independent, and watching him now stepping to high school makes me both happy and scared — happy for him becoming himself and a nice young man, sad for him being the strongest tie to hold me together is having less and less effect on me, and I could now picture myself going far far away without fearing too much of him being well, being taken care of. Maybe taking a trip to Japan and living there for a while will a natural step to bring me yet further away from him, and eventually would make me disappearing from this world, from his world, not that much a shock. I guess that is how a life goes. Sitting on the balcony this evening. Beautiful sunset. It's like a human life, too, that there is a moment when the burning orange on the horizon is so bright, vivid, and heartwarming, then, that perfect moment lasts for only a few seconds, then the blue sky is like a person's youth, becoming more and more a contrast to the horizon, as if the youth is coming back again. Yet, it becomes darker and darker, turned to a gray, then finally an ink sky... just like my life right now, standing at horizon of a sunset looking back to my youth, they seem so near and recent, yes they look beautiful from here, and I miss those days now, but they are just eclipse of memory, gone into the vacuum of past, no more, no more. I miss zhuzhu. Sometimes I could feel his eyes looking at me, and his body leaning on me, with him gentle snore and a cute face. How wonderful it was then when this were the days. Wherever you are now, maybe a parallel universe, maybe another life, take care of yourself. It has been my tremendous luck being with you for these years.","tags":"thoughts","url":"https://fengxia41103.github.io/myblog/feeling%20down.html"},{"title":"Dad","text":"This is a month of loss. I should say, this is a year of loss. First, zhuzhu, then dad. It has been a week and a day. The last week of his life was rough. I doubt by his will he would have chosen to live like that. But the sad thing of a person's end is that the decisions affecting your body and your pain were made by sometimes strangers. Regardless how your will has been formulated, in the end, a power outside the ones who care the most of you takes over, and it is not fun. How to think of it then? I felt sad when the night I had to sign off his life. But I feel the dad I know has been long gone. When I was holding his hand and watching him eating, I don't recognize him anymore. It was someone else living in that body, the light in the eyes were shut, and I wonder, what makes a person, who he is? It seems to be a convention that the last picture in a memorial service would always be one when he was already old, and I don't like this idea at all. Why not putting one of his prime time, when he was eighteen, young, fresh, lively, sunshine, w/ a smile towards the future, the life, hopeful, fearless, and all possible? I would like to when it's my time. I don't want to be remembered as a withering old guy. If anyone cares to remember me, be it that I'm still young, strong, on my bike riding around, having my camera, my music, my smile. I think it would be better. Ray was locked in 41, forever. I felt that the moment dad went, he actually saw him. The two greeted each other at the threshold. Ray, just like picking him up from a train station, grabbed his stuff, and the two chatted, walking along side by side. Where would they go? I don't know. Maybe another home in that world. Who is there? Maybe just the two of them, for now. But truthfully, I felt it's nice that way, that their two paths cross again... how many moments in life would you have wished that your path and another person's would across one more time? If this is what happened, then this is quite nice, isn't it? Living half, maybe more than half now, of the so called life, death, drifting apart... these have become more and more of a routine instead of a trauma. I can feel the heart is hardening, there is emotion still, but less and less there is tears, and the gut wrenching feeling of the loss. Things happen, people die, everything you hold dear seem to have an end at some point, and all you can do is to wait till the moment hits, then, if lucky, you will be there to watch them leave, to make some tough decisions for them, for their good... at least, it's a comfort that yours is sincere, and if there were any guilty feelings, you shoulder them. I guess that's the best you can do, and the best you should do. See through a life to its end is hard. Pet, human, family, relative, stranger... they are all the same. A light is off. You walk slowly to the door, turn around, look at this room for one more time, take a breath, gentlly close it behind you. Farewell, Dad. Wait for me, till we meet again.","tags":"thoughts","url":"https://fengxia41103.github.io/myblog/dad.html"},{"title":"AWS SSO","text":"AWS SSO is a pretty interesting idea. It's actually a bit confusing when I first touched it, namely, What is a profile How to setup a profile How to use a profile The article has good explanation on the concept. I'm gonna quote it here so I don't need to reinvent the wheels. What is SSO login With AWS SSO, you log in as a human, and the token you receive that represent you as a logged-in human can become any of the various IAM roles in the various accounts that they have been granted access to. Even though you give a profile in the input to aws sso login, the resulting session is not scoped to the account and role in that profile, by design. In the browser, when you log in through your AWS SSO start URL (in this case, https://foo.awsapps.com/start), you are logged in for all your access, and can find the account and role and clicking through it to get into the AWS web console. When you want to switch between accounts and roles, you don't need to log in again; you go back to the start page and click through into the console as a different account and role. In the CLI, it works the same way, you log in as a human using aws sso login, and this permits you to use any of the accounts and roles you have access to without logging in again. The curious thing is, in order do the SSO login, you must have at least one profile! Read on. What is a profile A profile configured in ~/.aws/config that is not using IAM User credentials does not represent a particular human. It represents a role that any human with the right permissions may assume, and should be named accordingly. The profile is about the activities those credentials enable, not who may be performing those activities. A profile configured for AWS SSO includes the AWS SSO instance (the start URL and the region that AWS SSO is configured in), the account, and the role in that account to use, when logged in through AWS SSO as some human (and will work only if that human has been granted access to that account and role through AWS SSO). A hypothetical profile in ~/.aws/config looks something like this: [profile AcctA-Role1] sso_start_url = https://foo.awsapps.com/start sso_region = us-east-2 sso_account_id = 111122223333 sso_role_name = Role1 [profile AcctB-Role2] sso_start_url = https://foo.awsapps.com/start sso_region = us-east-2 sso_account_id = 777788889999 sso_role_name = Role2 [profile AcctB-Role1] sso_start_url = https://foo.awsapps.com/start sso_region = us-east-2 sso_account_id = 777788889999 sso_role_name = Role1 In order to do the SSO login in previous section, you must have at least one profile , let's call it the default profile: [profile default] sso_start_url = https://foo.awsapps.com/start sso_region = us-east-2 It only needs the start_url and a region . With this you so aws sso login --profile default , and complete the login process. How to setup a profile Three ways: copy & paste directly to ~/.aws/config (at least for the default one, this is the easiest way!), go through aws sso configure , or using aws-sso-util . Use aws sso configure You use aws sso configure to setup a profile. Note that you can also just copy and paste to ~/.aws/config directly if you know what you are doing. ``` shell fengxia @fl5wvhzxat : ~/ aws $ aws configure sso SSO start URL [ None ] : < https : // d -< ..... > . awsapps . com / start > SSO Region [ None ] : us - east - 1 There are 12 AWS accounts available to you . Using the account ID < ...... > The only role available to you is : ReadOnly Using the role name \"ReadOnly\" CLI default client Region [ None ] : us - east - 1 CLI default output format [ None ] : json CLI profile name [ ReadOnly-<account id> ] : give - it - a - name ``` Now use the profile to login: aws sso login --profile <your profile> . Click the Allow on the browser. Get credential(!). This is a step easily omitted, and is exactly the warning above is about. Login only gets you the I'm a human proof, but the computer doesn't yet have credential (actually a short-life token) to run all the followup calls. Thus you need to acquire profile's credential: ```shell aws sts get-caller-identity --profile SaaS-Dev.Administrator ``` Expect to see an output like this: ``` json { \"UserId\" : \"xxxxxxx:feng.xia@blah.io\" , \"Account\" : \"xxxxxx\" , \"Arn\" : \"arn:aws:sts::xxxxxxx:assumed-role/AWSReservedSSO_Administrator_xxxxxx/<email>\" } ``` Now you are ready to launch CLI that will bear the AWS profile you choose and have access to the resources this profile is allowed to. Use aws-sso-util for batch It's ok to use the manual way for one profile. But in practice you may be granted permission on a list of profiles. Use aws-sso-util to populate all the profiles you can have: aws-sso-util configure populate \\ --region us-west-1 \\ --existing-config-action keep This will enumerate through your AWS access to grab all profiles you can have, and dump them into the ~/.aws/config . From that point on, you just pick one and use it. How to use a profile Now I have logged in, what if I have multiple profiles defined? Can I switch between them freely? — pretty much, but read this common misunderstanding first!!! I have seen people get the impression that if they want to use Role1 in account A (111122223333), they need to call aws sso login --profile AcctA-Role1, and that if they subsequently want to use Role2 in account B (777788889999), they need to then call aws sso login --profile AcctB-Role2. However, this isn't how AWS SSO or the CLI works! What's critical to note is that aws sso login does not deal with accounts or roles at all! You can see the code here; it uses the start URL and SSO region only. After calling aws sso login --profile AcctA-Role1, there are no credentials for Role1 in account A on your system. Using a profile is essentially to run a CLI within the context of a profile. Two tools, aws-vault and aws2-wrap . Both essentially do the same thing. My experience is better w/ aws2-wrap than aws-vault , so I'll use that for illustration. aws2-wrap --profile = SaaS-Dev.Administrator \\ aws organizations list-accounts Basically any AWS CLI will be executed by the profile you want to use. Success of the CLI is controlled by whether this profile has the permission or not.","tags":"dev","url":"https://fengxia41103.github.io/myblog/aws%20sso.html"},{"title":"猪娃娃","text":"猪， I don't know whether we made the right decision to send him through this surgery.

I'm gonna address them one by one but going out of order of these three according to a rank of importance they bring to the table based on my view. Data first because it's the information source and core value. Without it discussion of architecture is pointless. Architecture second because it describes the mechanics, the in-and-out of the data flow and the data processing, which means to do the discovery/magic to these data and create value for the customer. Resilience last because this is a gray area that is highly dependent on the nature of data themselves and use case. data The No. 1 challenge of data enterprise faces is not the lack of data, but also the lack of data. In today's world we have too much data. However, in face of the richness of these data we still feel poor because we lack quality data , and the quality can be viewed along these three dimensions — normalization of acquisition, normalization of the data type/format, and normalization of meaning. normalization of data acquisition Data are everywhere, and being served by all sorts of APIs and endpoints. But, each endpoint is different in term of handshake protocol, authentication & authorization, query syntax, transportation. RESTful is the go-to choice these days, GraphQL is on the rise. Yet, even with these terms as the overall guide, implementation details of such interface can dramatically skew its function, and even the look of these APIs, for example, some APIs are governed by data models and conform with protocol standard while some are home-grown URL that mimic the behavior but without guarantees. APIs today are like computer data bus protocols yesterday — luckily for the latter, motherboard manufacturer always have the say of which protocol it supports, thus all vendors of hardware that wish to communicate with the computer are driven to converge. But the Internet has no such power. APIs are developed independently, and have nearly zero governance of what it should or should not do. Therefore, integration with a data API is a rather unbalanced relationship between the data provider and the data consumer. The fragility of data acquisition is the first obstacle. normalization of data type/format We live in a world of non-structured data while our vision of data processing prefers, if not requires, structured data. Data anomaly, outliers, are the most expansive part of data processing because they are not included in the design blueprint, thus having a high chance becoming software bug. Regardless how smart the processing tool is, there will always be a step in which all data in the pipe start to look structured and alike. Taking image processing, for example. Regardless how much two images differ, analysis is relying on a pixel matrix to feed the data processor, and each pixel is a RGB number — a white pixel will have a value of 000 , but its place in the matrix is never missing. This effort of bringing non-aligned data types, fields, formats in-line so that they appear to be uniform is an overhead to data processor and can be costly. Some may argue that technology such as NoSQL makes this unnecessary. But that is not true. The root of such overhead is that the programmer must have a finite number of possibilities that the input can be so that s/he can write sensible implementation. Asking to handle any input is out of the question. Even in NoSQL, returned query will fill missing values with default or null, but records from the same table share the same data structure. This overhead of conditioning data in to structure is the second obstacle. normalization of meaning Data itself is dummy unless you know how to read it. It's a myth people think data equals information, or data equals to fact. Neither is true. Data is a collection of bits that represent a meaning within a context . I find it laughable people think AI is the magician who is going to tell me something of my data which I do not yet know ← assuming AI can do that, how would you know when it tells something new ? This is the same philosophical question that we seek truth, but even when truth stands right in front our face, can we recognize it? Data processing requires deep insight of the domain from which these data come from. Normalization of data type and format would help to clarify definition of the data fields, but it does not yet give the meaning to its interpretation. In a given industry, the meaning of a term is fairly clear and mutually understood by participants. At the same time they form a barriers to outsiders of that industry. Therefore, making cross-domain data analysis requires broad knowledge as if we are teaching the computer to speak different languages so it speak them all at once . This acquisition of domain knowledge is the third obstacle. Architecture Here we limit the discussion to the implementation side of an architecture. The challenge, IMHO, is the sheer number of technologies a team/project must be able to assemble together in order to form a product, which in turn are the hoops one must jump through in order to troubleshoot a problem. From bottom up, you need to know scripting or DSL to manage infrastructure resource, SQL or some flavor of it to manage DB, web framework in a programming language to write application, a list of third-party libraries to support the function, another set of tools, and certainly different programming languages (you can run Javascript for server, but you still have to write CSS just for the UI), for the UI/frontend, another set to write tests, yet another set of tools to scan code for venerability, security auditing, another for packaging and deployment, another for documentation, and one more for monitoring a running instance. We do these today, amazingly, end-to-end. Otherwise the product doesn't function. Yet each part requires learning curve, finding talent, building experience, and tolerating faults. Literally all parts of the castle is moving and our job is to keep the castle stand. Enterprise is assumed to have resources to foot the bill. But the reality is that the complexity of today's web application, especially if your team is to build and handle the full stack, is overwhelming. How to formulate a view that dissects such complexity into smaller scope so that the problem of each scope is defined well is the role of architecture. We can find plenty frameworks, design patterns, best practices, tools, blogs, products, turn-key solutions. The challenge, like a spoiled consumer who has limited fund, is to choose which one. All aside, architecture will be subjective. There is not a one-for-all size, but we also know it must be done. Thus, fusing all these different technologies into one * coherent view as a solution and be executable by the available resource is the fourth obstacle. resilience Resilience requires a yard stick. An example is the Service Level Agreement (SLA). In the discussion above we have stated the complexity of a system. Thus where the single point of failure or the weakest link is becomes difficult to identify. Experience plays a critical role in this space. One particular challenge that is often underestimated is how to design and implement fire drill — simulation of disaster or event the system is expected to resist. Common scenarios such as server crash, disk corruption, component patching and upgrade, failover, isolation of networking... these risks are real but difficult to account for. Not to mention error handling in code are growing which eats up human resource and focus. Then there is regulation on the data apart of inherent data integrity. Certain industry and certain type of data may face strict policy with which resilience is measured not only by the recovery time, but by accessibility, retention period, encryption, and more. In the end, resilience can only be defined by knowing the product well, knowing the customer well, knowing the use case well, and knowing the data well. So if to put all these into one obstacle, I would say it's the balance between commonality of the functions the product offers to all data and the uniqueness of function applicable only to some. enterprise Putting all these into an enterprise environment, there will be other variables such as networking constraint, on-prem vs. off-prem vs. hybrid, co-location, AD/LDAP integration. Architecture thus requires not only satisfaction of the core function, but potential to be extended and customized. I worked in one company where there was a whole team of \"custom engineering\" who retrofit the standard product case-by-case for customer, then I had another company whose motto was have \"one product for all customer\" who only adopted feature if it was to benefit all its customers. The obstacle in this sense can be to say \"no\" to a customer, or to bear a cost. So in sum, designing and building a resilient data architecture is the ultimate goal, but there isn't a finish line. Enterprise and startups face the same set of obstacles. Because of difference in resource they will have different strength and weakness in the process of approaching them. With large scale adoption of opensource, their toolbox are rapidly converging to the same set of tools. What will make difference, I think, will be more and more by the human resource.","tags":"thoughts","url":"https://fengxia41103.github.io/myblog/resilient%20data%20architecture.html"},{"title":"Noah locker room","text":"Hi Noah, This locker room incident has been on my mind for the last two days. I don't know what to say, yet I feel I have so much I want to say, ask, and converse. I called Sharon looking for advice, and she suggested to write you a letter. I thought it is a good idea. Words are easy to make, but also easy to forget. By writing them down I would have to organize my thoughts better, and examine again how the words would convey. Hopefully this is a better format for us to exchange our feelings, because I believe we both have a lot on the mind, but equally poor at expressing them well. So let's try this. I heard from mom that you are regretting what happened. I am glad to know that, but deep inside I feel very sad. Both as a parent and as an adult, I feel we have let you down. I wish we had known earlier of what was going on between you and other kids. Foremost I wish we had been there to offer a better solution than this one before you drew the conclusion this is the best option. But we weren't able to help then. You were hurt, and now we feel the pain also. I feel sad you went through this alone. I feel sad to see you in a situation where you don't feel safe. I feel sad none of us was able to be that person you are willing to go to when you were stressed. Looking back on the days we were together, I feel I lost you somewhere along the way. I don't know where, and I don't know how. It's a sense of failure. But more importantly, it's the sense of powerlessness, that we didn't know what to do when you, someone we care and love deeply, needed help. Watching you slipping down a slope is the most painful experience I could imagine, and it hurts badly. I know your mom for 16 years now. I don't recall seeing her in such an emotional distress before. She is a strong woman, but she is not a superwoman. Labor of work, our cats, taking care of your daily need, our Airbnb, she is trying to keep all these balls in the air. It's not easy. Over these 16 years, I also don't recall seeing her as happy as when you were admitted into the YOTA that night. If feeling proud of one's child is common for all parents, then hers towards you is on a higher level than many others. If you recall, it was also her who registered you to these trials over the last three years, and nudged me to take you there when I was hesitant. If there were one person on this world who is wholeheartedly cheering for your swimming progress, it is her. Seeing you losing the seat on YOTA is a devastating blow. I could only imagine how hard this is on her. When I went through my photos, I often saw pictures of you since little. I can't help thinking how much future was lying in front of this young boy then, and how we have been proud you for all the little steps you have made. Over this journey, you have fallen miserably in the past -- bruises, scars, maddening moments, you name it. Yet, you grew, grew, became stronger and stronger each year. I recall the days when we could list the first 10 words you knew and the exact next word coming up to your vocabulary. Now I wouldn't dare to challenge your knowledge in science, biology, and certainly no match in those games, youtubes, and God knows what other things your brain has acquired. You have learned so much, and we love seeing it! One day you would also be a parent, having your child. Maybe then you would understand how much we are proud of you and all these, and how much seeing you fall like hurts. Remember I said that this is our first time being a parent? Each passing day, each challenge you faced, was also a new one to us. It's not easy to drive to YMCA each day considering million other things have to be taken care of. But both of us enjoyed it, because your training and your achievement gave the time the best meaning we could wish for. My best reward was always the trip back after your training. Seeing you in a good spirit warms my heart. When we learned you have made new friends on the team, we felt so much relieved because we worried about this after the school suspension. In my opinion, having mutual support is the best part of a sports team. Everytime when you walked out the training with other kids smiling and chatting, I felt as happy and cheerful as you were. When you went to your coach after each event during the meet to clasp hand with her and hang out for a chat, I felt we have found you a group that would take care of you well and you would be thriving in it. So, picturing all these thrown away is extremely difficult for us at the moment. Even though we are adults, we don't know what to do now. We feel the pain, both of yours and of ourselves', but we don't have a magic pill. You have read coach's email. I think they are sincere, honest, and will handle this well. I trust in their experience and judgment. So whatever the consequence they decide, I would respect. I also think we the family owe an apology to both the team and kids involved. For the one you offended, we owe an apology for the act. Violence is never a good idea. It will only create more violence. For the other two boys in the locker room, we owe an apology for having them witnessed such a violence. They were forced into this situation without a choice. And for your coach and team, we owe an apology for putting them through this disruption. Mom and I will reach out to coach for a meeting including you. I think we should do this face to face. Personally I feel ashamed in front of them. Let's try to fix this as much as we can as a family together. It's never too late to recognize our own fault, admit it, and give it a try of fix. I also encourage you to reach out to your coach and maybe other kids. They shared the same feeling we have, that we feel sad seeing you did that, and worried about your well being. If you had something to say to them, tell them. Maybe like what I'm doing now, put your thoughts in a letter. You may think that \"they must hate me now\". Trust me, they don't hate you. Nobody hates someone who is sincere and honest even if he had just made a mess. They are probably as shocked and confused as we are. Ok. Thanks for reading this. I just want you to know our feelings, and find a way to communicate. I still wish mom and I could be the go-to person for you when you are in distress. Nothing is worse for us than seeing you Noah suffers. I hope you will understand this now and put trust in us next time.

Certainly there isn't a single answer. But there is always one one could have. I like old books . They are not necessarily classics in any measure, but just having a senior age seems to spell well for me than the youngs. The youngs usually have a much cleaner, and most of the time colorful and eye-catching, jacket than the olds. But I found myself tend to pull them off the shelf less hesitantly than the olds. For one, I would admit these old books have probably better collector value, whether they were good book back when or not. It runs like an antique — the older it is, the more $$ in essence it redeems if ever being traded. These old books, some published before the 1900, are heavier, poorer in condition ← papers turning brown, jacket loose, some have a falling-apart binding altogether... I read some of them, and most of the contents are not impressive much, either... but somehow they hold a charm, a charm I start to wonder what it is besides its rarity perhaps? Had a chat with 小舅 this morning, part of the conversation was about aging. Tie it with this book topic, I think this is the same question one could also ask about an old person — what's the charm? No more look, no more physiques... wealth? nah... knowledge? perhaps not, either, cause the young folks probably don't care what your so called knowledge or life experience as you would like them to, just take any son or daughter for example, otherwise parenting would have been a super rewarding experience with a permanent fans standing by... but we all know, instead, you likely have a permanent foes ready to fight as the slightest criticism... so, what is it then? I think, for these old books, a big part of their charm lies in the fact of a God's view — same as learning a piece of history (well, indeed many of my books are about history), that you already know the plot, the movie's end, but you are going through them yet again, with a satisfaction that you know what is coming, thus feeling superior... but it is more than that. If history book can be viewed as a story telling, then there are other books which are purely interesting because its content has been swiped off the history's horizon, like the books on the old south, of American communities of all kinds of (to me) strange religions, beliefs, commune living... they are like fantastic shows at a market meet, some bizarre snake woman or oriental tribe man... just an awe effect, a stimulation... but again, because the length of time in between the book's birth and my time, I could view it both feeling the excitement in such adventure, and the security of an untouchable ← whether it was a dangerous journey or a cruel reality, it's a text of life that echos but forever remote. Also with aging, many of the sayings back when have been distilled to the point that they are either still well alive, or dead. Thus, equipped with what I know today, it becomes much assuring when I appreciate a view by the author, whereas the newer books bear the risk that many of their topics are well contemporary and even familiar, but my mind of their content is just as confusing — I think in this sense, I read to seek an answer, an opinion, that would help me to understand the topic, but new books tend to present yet another view, thus adding another layer of complexity to the understanding, while the old books can be read in a black & white scope... isn't this then lazy on reader's part? or just a deep rooted urge to have an explanation even though it's rushed and even false? I fear so. Thus, contemporary topics, before they could themselves turn into history, carry less weight than the olds. This can be testified further by all the social media posts one does or receives → few survives for more than 24 hours even. These should not be called \"information\" at all. They are digital comets, flashing by, and if you happen to see its return, I doubt you would even recognize it's the same one! So sadly, many of the technical books fall into this category, books on a programming language, on a technology, at lease Reader's Corner carries a section on Math and Physics, I guess these are more endurable than any of the IT stuff. So, what is lasting? A novel, a drawing, a story, a journalism of a visit of a foreign place (if it's more about the feeling of the author than the actual geo facts).... in the end, it's the human part of the book, the emotion, the psychology, love, hatred... those, that are still make the book not only relevant, but good. It's a cliche that human haven't changed over these thousand of years, what the Greek felt about love echoes verbatim today. So it is. Readers change, generation after generation. So are the authors. If you want to leave something behind your life, if you do, avoid being a commentator of contemporary events, dig deep, find the feelings, find that human that is not just inside the story, but inside yourself... if you get lucky, which suspect the moment would be rather scary and agonizing if not outright devastating, that book will hold its value well, with ages passing by.","tags":"thoughts","url":"https://fengxia41103.github.io/myblog/books.html"},{"title":"2021 Christmas Day","text":"Warm day, getting to low 60s, and felt rather like Spring if you sit in the sun, a bit windy from time to time, I guess it's the cold air and warm air swapping their places.

Reading this book , a slow documentary of this rural place in North Carolina, a book of stories that everyone of them is in their 70s, 80s, or 90s, it's a story book of the past, of a place and time that have gone by, likely never will return. I start to feel that everyone's life is actually a mix bag of places, identities, trades, and not the least, times. In a way, everyone is misplaced, somehow, into a space and a life that didn't feel s/he belongs, but then, it went on, went through, became someone's life, or part of it, and then, a story in a book somewhere, or maybe never be told, and never to be heard, just came and then gone. The first time I felt that way was during the gig in China in 2014. Riding the shuttle bus to 阳泉, I distinctly remember it felt like throwing myself into a tunnel, a black hole... not that the place was bad, it was fine, a city setting, though not metropolitan, was decent and busy... it was the time when I was going through the breakup of marriage, didn't know what to do about it, so rather, just put myself into an exile, traveling from US to 北京, then to 太原, then onto this bus... I felt being placed into a space I never dreamed of ever possibly be, yet, there I was, so the feeling was both real and surreal... at the time I thought that was an interesting sensation, or perhaps should call it an experience, that just served as a distraction from the problem I was struggling with. Yet, reading this book, I start to see that everyone's life, and I could bet now on everyone's, anyone's, is just like that — a mismatch of time and place, that the person would feel something isn't right, but can't tell what it is... now I know what it is, it's this feeling of misplacement, a person who would have lived that way, ended up having had this way... mismatch? I can't say that no more now. What happened is real, and that isn't mismatch... we may not want to have had the thing happen to us the way it was, but it happened, and whatever the days one had, that's THE version, the only version, there is. So there isn't a misplacement at all. It's just, destiny, or fate, or life. I'm jealous that most of the folks in this book were content about their days. Some had colorful life, some simple. I think once I hit their age, I would be content as well. A life is long enough. Though sometimes it felt short, I doubt I would ever want to be reborn and relive one life again. We just travel through this mix bags of place, time, things, people, then, coming out of it, is a life, no more, no less. It's good enough.","tags":"thoughts","url":"https://fengxia41103.github.io/myblog/2021%20xmas.html"},{"title":"Cliche","text":"Listening to this video , an opinion on a not-so-recent event between China and Japan, again, and this idea came to me — cliche. I like many of the talks by this host, but this particular one sounds, dull, thus, cliche. As a commentator on news, the value, or the content that we listen to, is his opinion, which makes me wonder, just how many opinions one can have? More precisely, how many different ways of thinking, views, that one person can have on these events? Especially if you are commenting on a daily basis, I feel it is a stretch on some days, not because he is not good, but that a person's mind isn't always sharp everyday — on a good day, the thought cuts through the news like a knife over butter; then on other days it felt aimless, and worse, becomes a cliche. Any more than just the variation of days, I start to feel more and more that a person, myself in particular, lives towards a narrow end of a tube if one is not consciously aware of such, or even battle against such. What I mean by this narrowing tube is that the scope of thoughts become more and more static, that you have a particular way of viewing this world, thus your opinion, and that opinion becomes more and more dull, more and more repetitive — having a hammer, you look everything like a nail ← another cliche by its own! This is actually alarming. At the beginning I explained it that the forum is restricted — for voicing dissent there are only that many people who are in that, or interested in it. But now I am having a second thought, that it's not only the number of lecturers is limiting the variety of opinions, but the opinions themselves are following a limited set of reasoning — in other words, even providing more chef, but they are making the same menu, same dish, same recipe, same taste.... you can open yet another McDonald's, but it will be no different from the one right around my corner. Why? When speaking of an even between China and Japan, it's always the quote of Japan never officially apologized for its sin and crime in the World War II to China, thus itself becomes an original sin, like a inferior birth, a skin color, that one would be forever doomed regardlessly, unconditionally, and involuntarily... Further, one can continue the exercise that China has done many wrongs, yet he didn't apologize to its victims, either, thus the two are just equally evil, or unfair ⇆ this, then, creates a downward spiral that the two race towards the bottom, nothing else, we compete to win a contest whose hand is dirtier, but what a pointless race that will be!... If civilization, regardless its precise definition, is generally accepted as a upward trend that human lifts itself out of barbarity, then such, or any, downward spin is the wrong direction to take. Period. Then, these criticisms will also quote that Japan lost the war, and we won, and the identify of the we is another cliche to dispute ← what are, \"we\"?... And keep going, cliche brings the expectation of winner being generous and loser being gracious, or grateful for winner's generosity, and so on and on.... it is a cliche, isn't it? But if you really set to look at any of these reasoning, none is valid automatically, isn't it? ← too many times they are being thrown into discussion or party talk as if they were the First Cause, the very first domino of reasoning that requires no proof , but they are not, and even the First Cause itself is not.... therefore, there are many loopholes, eg. who says winner should be generous? — the best explanation I can think of is that it's a moral code we hold with pride, or a self-image one would like to project so to be perceived as such a person. But all these are as subjective as a religion — just because you hold a belief the earth is flat, or round, leads to no reasoning that another person, your peer or foe, should also share that view, and vice versa. Even putting these loopholes aside, by listening to one person's talk for a while, you start to sense the shape of his hammer. I'm not criticizing at all. Rather, I think it's a built-in limitation of everybody, philosophers included. The wise have a wider scope, like a department store, while myself is like a corner 711, then there are others like a hawker on the street selling a single dish.... this picture is actually quite accurately echoing the reality of life itself, that different people having different capacity, luck, career, success failure, status... the same diversity applies to mind as well, and just as widely dispersed across a spectrum as fortune and fame. So, if we say some 80% of the total wealth is being held within the hands of a some 1% population, I suspect the same ratio applies to the scope of the mind and opinions. But this doesn't mean an elite society, because there is a fundamental difference between monetary wealth and the scope of a mind — money is singular, meaning money carries a singular meaning whether it's RMB, $, but the scope of a mind is not. More precisely speaking, for money, the more of the same thing, the merrier, being repetitive is actually, the sublime success, whereas for scope of a mine, the more of different things, the better, being repetitive is the sublime failure. Therefore, you see, there are two opposite force pulling everyone of us, and the society, the world in general, that one force of repetition, that brings comfort of life, and one against it, brings life of the mind. So one could say that there is a risk one exchanges the life of mind for comfort, and the temptation is real and strong. Therefore, not only we have to allow more different voices to be heard, but we have to actively seek out for more variety of opinions so to disturb the scope of mind you already have. If only so could one, if not resisting the erosion of comfort onto the mind, at least making it a moving target, so that the mind continues on a run, it may be on an exile, but it's still better than being stale.","tags":"thoughts","url":"https://fengxia41103.github.io/myblog/cliche.html"},{"title":"2021 Thanksgiving","text":"What a surprise! Went to have dinner w/ Noah together yesterday. A cold winter day. And he went to Publix by himself, and got me a bag of chocolate!!!!! Oh mine mine mine!!!! This is the very first gift I ever received from him, all by himself, without me ever saying a word about it, reminding him of anything, or even thinking about it!!! Indeed he is growing up now. Soon I guess he will leave the nest and fly away to find his own path. I'm gonna miss him. I know that already. Yet, it's a happy moment if that comes, I think, that seeing him growing into a big guy, and a kind heart, is the best prize I could ever hope for in this life. Sometimes I wonder, that what is the meaning of my life? After 2006 I knew I have a big role to play in this family. Yet I tried, but I don't think I did a good job. I wish I could be wiser, more patient, more tolerant, more of everything. But it's the inevitable shortcoming, I suppose, that I need these hiccups and failures to grow. People around me paid price, bore the burden. But one thing I could say to myself, is that I never did a thing with intention to harm, especially if it were for my own's benefit. All the blunders I caused, though can't be excused as accident, was sincere mistake. I wish Noah would be a wiser guy than I was. Not only then he would be a better person, but a happier person, with less regret. I don't think regret is a terrible thing, actually, because one only regrets things that are dear to him/her, which speaks that s/he cared, felt, and touched the heart. I think it's better to regret, so to feel the pain, and the joy, too, even though things didn't work out the way you wished, but the feeling of it, the soul touching moment, the memory you may still have, are worth the agony... after all, walking through this life, you live only once, nothing really matters towards the end, only the soul, the mind, the heart, and hopefully, by then, also tears. Reorganizing the online album, flipped through some built over the last four five years. I'm quite impressed by how many I have done! The two albums are still wonderful. Four years, two years, felt like a moment just passed by... how funny, but also, how terribly sad... it has been a while... I don't feel it anymore. Guess if living without a person to miss, time doesn't really matter, it stops, you move along day by day, older and older, but the best of you were frozen in time, doesn't walk with you anymore... it just stood there, where you were... More and more, I start to feel this life is not real, more and more I feel the walking me isn't me anymore... it's like me watching a stranger's life, I'm just watching, feeling something, but not much, as if his isn't relevant much to myself... why so? Is this the feeling of losing control? but, what is control then? and did I ever have it?... I doubt. This is a feeling of disengagement, disengaging from this life, from everything around, everybody around... it isn't a hermit, just lost interest in these things, not even much of self, just lost interest... there are still joy, music, laugh, topics I think, discussion I do, talks I listen, moments I like... but overall, it's cold, cold inside... all the efforts are to keep the candle burning, but it's flicking, flicking, flicking, not much there. A beautiful weather today. Walked w/ doggie in downtown Chapel Hill. Quiet. Warm sun. A few pedestrians here and there. A couple joints were open. Few cars... felt like walking into a movie in which the town was deserted... and there was no zombies, no disasters coming... just the two of us, walking slowly... he sniffed around, but didn't pick up any food from the ground, to my surprise... I guess he felt the same relaxing atmosphere as I did. No store. No shop. Just a winter day.","tags":"thoughts","url":"https://fengxia41103.github.io/myblog/2021%20thanksgiving.html"},{"title":"Speak up","text":"It has been a while since last update. Thoughts come and go. Sometimes they appeared suddenly, like a light, but I was always in the middle of something, I suppose, so they just eluded me. How sad... the funny thing is, the older I become, the more fearful I become if ideas and thoughts don't come to me. Especially, when chatting with friends, I started to see myself repeating the same idea and way of speaking over and over... such a, stable version , is both a product of some offline thinking regarding the topic, and a sign that my opinions are becoming fixed. At this age I do think having a fixed opinion on many things is both a good thing and a natural outcome — after these many years of living and working and life experience, I doubt I could be shocked or surprised by much anymore. Everything is like a routine, and everything and everyone look pretty much the same, mean the same, to me. I hardly even find myself laugh much these days anymore. It feels like a cloud over the heart, that blocks the sun from peeking through. Once a while, the light rays come out. But those moments are rare, and don't last long, either. Anyway. I'm here to talk about a moment in this movie , a well known one I have watched many many times since childhood, and was impressed by what I read from it this time — indeed, life experience is giving me a sharper ear and a sharper eye now than before, that I picked up something I never realized before! So here is the scene. In the first encounter w/ Japanese navy, the main character's boat ran out of ammunition. The sailor, who was portraited as a hero, was frustrated to the point that he was speechless. Then, the main character, the captain, came down from his post, asking, \"Why did you stop shooting?\"... silence.. \"Why?\"... the two looked at each other, as if speaking through the eyes... \"It is...\", not finishing the line, the sailor choked, supposedly from his extreme frustration over this eluding opportunity to hit enemy. But here is what I dislike — this type of interaction, the so called please guess my mind way of communication, is absolutely BS, unproductive, and hurtful! For God sake, this is in a battle field, and being able to get information passed on clearly and efficiently is as critical as it gets. Yet, the sailor had to speak nothing , and let the captain come to the spot, asking \"why\", and still don't get a straight answer until a couple tries!!! This is ridiculous! But very Chinese! I have related another one in this blog . Both are examples of what I call the corruption of the Chinese language . I don't know why and what is going on w/ these people, or the script writer, who value such way of talking over speaking up directly, and honestly. But I can be sure, this is exact the root of the problem of all the misfortunes people over there are experiencing, fighting over, and suffering from. No exception! Without giving out a straight answer seems an art of talking. But I would say, NO!! This isn't art! This is nothing but being cunning, irresponsible, and giving yourself an excuse not to think of the topic much. In the end, you are dodging to have an opinion on the subject, which, even though having an opinion always sound arrogant, arbitrary, your-words-against-mine, but I still believe there isn't an alternative to this. Call this the curse of human being — you must have an opinion, whether you speak up or not. Since you do, I think it's better to speak up, speak out, speak straight... The sailor should have shouted, \"Sir, we run out of ammunition now! What should we do?\"... and by saving the captain from climbing down to get this info in order to make a decision, the whole boat could have been more efficiently run, and who knows, maybe it could have indeed won that battle, as so many had wished. But this lesson is still not learned. And everywhere you turn there, you see the same pattern over and over and over — guess my mind, guess my intention, guess my command.... everyone is reading of everyone's mind, yet, no Yuri has been identified. So the entire matter, be it a country, a school, an individual, is turned into a giant riddle, whereas everyone is making it more and more difficult with each speaking chance.","tags":"thoughts","url":"https://fengxia41103.github.io/myblog/speak%20up.html"},{"title":"Laugh is who you are","text":"I must have listened to this before, maybe years ago. I don't remember much, but it wasn't unpleasant. But not this time. After talking about China's nationalism on the rise, it has picked up pace and become an avalanche. The most recent episode is the launch of this movie , Chosin Reservoir. I haven't watched this, but it is nothing but a propaganda. Let's just leave it at that. This talk , however, really disturbed me. Not that its content is truthful or not. It's the audience. In particular, it's when and at what they laughed. I never realized how revealing watching someone's laugh could be. But this is a lesson I should have learned early in life, but now isn't too late, either. When the talk spoke there were two options for the Russian ambition to acquire a usable harbor — one in China, and another in Korea, he paraphrased a line by the China's ambassador to Russian back then as a proof that China also saw the issue clearly — \"Well, since there are two options here, if you can't get mine (the Chinese), why not consider the Korea's?\" What a smart line! But then, the audiences laughed....... this, make my heart ache. What a shameful moment it is! Yes. It is absolutely shameful to think this line smart, even entertaining, and it was absolutely shameful for such a proposal offering someone else's property for yours because you were then getting robbed. Shame, total, shame. Then, it is a shame, on all the audiences who were excited by this line, thought this a smart idea, and laughed — even if they did burst in laugh at the beginning, I wished they would then feel a chill on their back right after, because what they just did is exactly what all the shameful moments in history had been — when oneself is threatened, it seems a super common strategy to shake off the threat is to offer the guy next door for the sacrifice. I heard the Inca sacrificed human. I wonder whether, then, neighbors turned onto each other. But I do have heard that people did that, when in East Germany, when in the Cultural Revolution, when in the concentration camp.... if self-preservation is the ultimate survival instinct, is there a line one should not even cross even in the direst situation?... I doubt. But then, I still believe such an act deserves a guilty feeling, deserves a regret, and deserves an agony of conscience, if it had happened. Yet, indeed many laughed. Chilling, isn't it? Think of what one would find funny, you see the true inner side of this person. There is a saying that the core of a comedy is tragedy. This is very true — when we laughed the proposal to swap Korean in the rape, it's certainly a tragedy for Korea. But don't you see this is also a tragedy for ourselves!? It is not only a tragedy, it is also sick. So, during our youth we all learned that China had reputation of being the sick man of Asia in the 19th and early 20th century. Now, I have to say, its mind, and heart, still are. Total shame.","tags":"thoughts","url":"https://fengxia41103.github.io/myblog/laugh.html"},{"title":"Witness of an Age","text":"This has been lingering in my mind recently. I don't know how to put it. Reading the book The Making of Tomorrow kicked off the train of thought that the root cause of this thinking is the idea of collectivism , which, in the author's view, nationalism is but the ultimate phase of a collectivism. I have long been surprised, first to myself, then by others since I learned the idea, that the so called state, or a nation, or one's home country, the one that everyone seems to hold so dear that it is often analogized to one's mom, a figure which is highly sacred, in theory at least, that demands one's love, one's devotion, dedication, gratitude, as if the attitude towards it/her defines who you are, is actually quite a recent thing! In other words, I have never given too much thought where this sacred figure came from. Taking it for granted, I, probably like many many others, regardless their education, nationality, background, family, and so on, are born to consider myself being part of this body, this thing called my home country , if not because of any particularly external advocate through school or others, it is self-evident by you being one's citizen , a legal stamp of your membership. But, what is it? I'm not here to talk about citizenship vs. the people abuse. Rather, it's the patriotism, the wonderful ideal of devoting oneself to his/her country's sake (usually in the name of defense its well-being, well, this word well-being is the tricky part, isn't it? How do you define that?), whose foundation is the idea of a country, a nation, or a state. Reading the On Liberty and a few others, the fundamental discussion if the line drawn between the rights of an individual and the rights of his/her community. Exactly because there is such a group, an individual is now always on defense to its erosion that he exchanges too much of him own for too little . But why so? If taking this conflict as an abstract question, it's easy to see quite a few loop holes in this challenge. Let me list them: If an individual doesn't have any right to begin with, then there isn't such a struggle of exchanging them for something, isn't it!? For example, slavery. One solution. Vice versa, if the state is deemed having no right to begin with, it is not in position to trade, either. For example, the western mountaineers who give no damn of any authority because they simply don't need anything in return. Now, if the trade is inevitable and possible, being that both case 1 & 2 are not impossible, then a trade is a trade, meaning it follows the dynamics of any other kind of trades — both bring something to the table which the other party likes to have, but a power struggle is always the true drive that whoever is in the more powerful position is to benefit more. So now, moving these three into the sphere of an individual vs. a State, we could go to case 1 or 2, but highly unlikely these days. The book actually contributed this to the form of production we are using these days, that the mass production and mass collaboration make your life without the support of a massive supply chain, which essentially is the other name of your State, is impossible. I won't survive a week, or even a day, if I were unplugged from my environment. Period. Where do you get food, water, gas, heat, clothes, shoes, shelter? Just strip yourself and go into any nearby woods for a week, see if you will come out alive. I bet you won't. Therefore, such production form requires collaboration, which in turn can only happen when N persons are organized into a group . The more advanced the product is, the bigger the group becomes. If you look around, you will see that the so called advanced society, or progress, or development, or civilization, its trademark is its growing size of group! This isn't even a population topic. This is sheer driven by the production need, thus what used to a family surviving on his own land, then became a village/tribe huddling together, maybe even w/ walls now, to then a town, then a state, then a country, and recent years a global economy → you see, the trend is clear, the size is growing larger and larger, the dependency becomes not only necessary, but stronger, remoter (from yourself), and there is not sign it will abate, yet. Therefore, now looking at the trade we are to do — on one side, is yourself, a person; on the other, a blob, God knows how many people there, called a State, or maybe one day called Earth vs. Star 908 — the key is: the power is extremely unbalanced . By sheer number, you are outnumbered a few millions to one in any case. By resource? forget it, you are a cave man waving a rock while the other party pulls out a gun, and you also know he wants your stuff... How awkward, or even, pathetic, you should feel if this is a real trade! And this is exactly the trade everyone of us is entering, upon birth. Since the founding of the US, at least we have one case, in which the small guy is bold enough to claim, that your gun can't just overpower my rock without damaging your conscience ← call this a bluff ! But this is the one bluff we have, and takes courage to do that! Seriously. What alternative do you have besides such a bluff!? Pray for the other guy to not use the gun? Well, it seems that both are appealing the same assumption, or should we say, hope, that the other guy has some restriction, whether it's a conscience, or one thread of goodwill, or his fear of his mom, whatever, there is something in him that we can appeal to so that the trade isn't based on gun vs. rock, but on the value of the goods, thus a fair deal . But, honestly, we don't know. Bluffing is probably the first move, but also the only move. For all the small guys, upholding this bluff is the only choice, no other! Some are so stupid that why not join the big guy? Well, remember, this is the trade you can't switch side. This is the same scenario that had been played out over and over and over and over. If the big guy's determination is to get you, well, by being a Jew and a Jew collaborator to the Nazi's will not gain you freedom, or life, at all. The trade is not going to happen. The robbery is to happen. It is just delayed when you cave in. Therefore, it's painful to me to witness China's nationalism on the rise these years. I think the people should be proud. Yes they have achieved a lot. But, like a humble guy rising quickly to fame, without having a good mind, he is lost in the sudden fortune and all the flashlights. Not only he thinks he is indeed a genius deserve the fortune, but he now looks down on everyone as if they were downright lazy and stupid ← this, is not pride. This, is arrogance , and a large chunk of the heads over there are displaying, and many are firmly believing in, such arrogance. What creates arrogance? Ignorance. But, how to define this? Even if it were defined, how to, remove it? I have no idea. Education? Nah, it's just yet another word, a creed, a magic bullet that means nothing, having the same emptiness as the word ignorance. So, it seems to me, it's doomed, the fate of the world, and the fate of the country, and, the fate of its members — when one party is believing nothing but fist, a fist is the only signal his brain can process. I'm not advocating a war between China and anyone. But I do want to point out, that the mindset, or the world view, is such that: There is always us vs. them. If you are not one of us, you must be one of them. You either kowtow to me, or I kowtow to you. No 3rd state exists (how about sitting together to have tea!?). As long as the mindset is so, I don't see any possibility to make a conversation. But the sad thing is, while Chinese crowd is so motivated by patriotism , they are willingly giving up the bluff, the bluff I have stated above, which is the only saving grace an individual can have to counter the State. In other words, if the little guy's defense is his bluff, the big guy, instead of waving his gun outright, suddenly pulls out a shining stone and say, \"Look my friend! Isn't this beautiful? It's yours now!\".... too good to be true, right? This is the same thing that the Monkey king was put on his headband, quite a good looking thing, until you put it on and the code is in someone else's hand. And this, is exactly I'm witnessing — the shining thing is called patriotism , nationalism , whatever the name it is, the effect is the same, too many Monkey kings are now blinded by it, eagerly putting it on, calling of his/her bluff.... oh people, it is coming, trust me, if the guy entices you w/ this, he is to recite that code next, you don't need to guess, it's not part of the plan, it is THE plan. And just like Monkey King's headband also, once you put it on, you can't remove it. Sad, frustrated, and pure, utter, stupidity.","tags":"thoughts","url":"https://fengxia41103.github.io/myblog/witness.html"},{"title":"REACT Key Authentication (2/2) - frontend","text":"Following last article on API backend using Tastypie, this article will show REACT frontend side, in particular, the login and logout . Again, I'm very surprised that not many npm readily available to encapsulate such a common task. Blogs show how the author has done the authentication, aka. authentication, but I couldn't find much on how to design the logout — Should I redirect to page upon logout? if yes, which page, any? How then should the routing be? and how to protect all pages to require authentication? Design REACT login & logout Observe the followings: login view : First of all, I'm not saying this page is only doing login. It can be any view as you wish. As long as the login call is happening while user is using this page, I'm calling it the login page, thus there is always a login view . The actual login call to post can be component rendered by this view. logout component : is most likely a button/icon on nav bar that lets user to logout. Nothing prevents you doing a full page just for the logout. So similar to the login view , as long as the logout call to API is happening on this page/view, this is the logout component . Auth logic root view : is the mother view of the login view . For simplicity purpose I'm also drawing it to be the mother of all other views which require authentication . Theoretically the latter is not mandatory because you can use routing to goto another URL. But keeping them as children view ensures that they can not escape the login logic. Auth protected views : any view that requires authentication. Once we have these concepts, the requirements are clear: If not authenticated, show login view . Once authenticated: If login was his first page, go to app's landing page If user was to view a protected view but was rerouted to the login, show the protected view. Logout will put user back to login view , or any other public view which does not require authentication, ie. marketing site. Where to save the key There isn't a single answer. Here I'm using sessionStorage because it is per browser tab instead of localStorage which is global. Whatever your storage solution is, the auth key needs to be saved because different view/component would use this storage to determine whether a key is presented, thus driving its logic what to render. Pseudo code Auth logic root view View itself isn't important. A pseudo code to handle auth is shown below: get storaged auth key if kye is not found : render login view else : render by routing Login view This is where you design the login form/dialog/inputs, and submit username and pwd to API for authentication. get username & password POST to API login URL if success : save username & API key to storage goto protected landing page Logout component read storaged username and auth key Call API logout URL if success : clean storaged info goto login page When using sessionStorage , make sure you do both the removeItem(key_name) and at last the .clear() . Routing Login view is at /login . Application views are at /<something> . / is mapped to anything but /login ← so upon logged in, goto / will lead us somewhere other than the login 1 . Once logged in, goto / . Once logged out, goto /login . central routing mapping In route.js where REACT routers are defined: const routes = [ // auth { path : \"login\" , element : < LoginView /> }, // application specific { path : \"/\" , element : < MainLayout sideNavs = { navbar_items } /> , children : [ // landing page, default to dashboard { path : \"/\" , element : < Navigate to = \"/dashboard\" /> }, { path : \"404\" , element : < NotFoundView /> }, // catch all, 404 { path : \"*\" , element : < Navigate to = \"/404\" /> }, ], }, ]; in login Upon success, navigate(\"/\") , thus use the routing above for further navigation: // call login handler const on_submit = async e => { e . preventDefault (); const resp = await login ({ user , pwd }); if ( resp . success ) { set_auth ( user , resp . data ); navigate ( \"/\" ); } }; in logout Upon logout, navigate(\"login\") . Here we can't go to / but must use /login because of disk cache ! — Goto / will route you to the default landing page. You would expect that landing page will be reloaded, thus noticing that authenticate info is not there anymore, thus redirect yet again to /login . But because of disk cache, browser will actually render the landing page just fine ( without rerendering it , thus skipping its code)! If you force browser to reload this landing page again (hold down left CTRL then refresh), it will get you back to login page because now it runs code as if for the first time, and realizes that authentication info is missing. Therefore, you must goto /login upon logout. // call logout handler const on_logout = async e => { e . preventDefault (); const resp = await logout (); if ( resp . success ) { // clear session storage session . removeItem ( \"user\" ); session . removeItem ( \"api_key\" ); session . clear (); // back to root navigate ( \"login\" ); } }; We could write in login code navigate(\"/landing\") . But this presents two issues: 1. This is hardcoded behavior that logged in will always go to this landing page. This is not necessarily the case. If user is logging in from / view, this is correct behavior. But if he was thinking to go /another/page and was rerouted back to do the login first, he should be sent to /another/page in the end. This, if you go to / at the end of login, will be naturally achieved by the routing, instead of you writing yet another code to catch his intention, then goto that at the end. ↩","tags":"dev","url":"https://fengxia41103.github.io/myblog/react%20key%20authentication%20frontend.html"},{"title":"REACT Key Authentication (1/2) - API side","text":"I'm very much surprised that not much information can be found on this topic. As a matter of fact, there are very few examples on how to handle two most common tasks that every single frontend must face: login and logout — I mean, there are too many code examples out there which talks from one aspect of things, namely either from the frontend or the backend, but the code hows too much details on the how-to, but lacks illustration of how pieces are fit together. In other words, it has all the implementations but little design. So after days of trial, let me write down what I learned, and hopefully will put this task to sleep once for all. API Backend In my case, backend is Django w/ Tastypie REST API and frontend in REACT. Tastypie is just a matter of convenience. Here in essence I'm assuming there is a RESTful backend serving data and supports API key authentication. If you were not fullstack, you may not need to bother how backend is coded. But Tastypie doesn't come w/ login/logout touch points out of box, so I had to write code for that. API & data model I have a strong opinion against this type of APIs. In my view, they should not call themselves APIs even. These APIs are designed artificially , meaning they are not generated from data models, but instead is coded from scratch by some dev ← this kind is the worst because this adds another layer of translation (and I'm talking about knowledge translation, not coding language translation) from backend's data model (which is the source of all truth, especially about data's logical relationships) to yet another data presentation (in form of web accessible URLs) 1 . In short, backend API should only be a (de)serialization of the underline data. It should not change the meaning of the data, and absolutely not modifiy their logical relationships. three types of auth & data model It's quite confusing when one talks about authentication, authorization, and sometimes, role-based. How are they fit into a single picture? In essence the purpose of auth is to answer two questions: data ownership and CRUD mapping . Backend authentication & authorization Type 1 : Fit for public data API whereas user management can be optional. There might still be authentication step, but essentially backend doesn't distinguish difference between two users — A & B users have the same right within the data domain. The idea here is to focus on the models that support functions of your application, so don't get distracted yet by user management. Type 2 : Now to introduce user A vs. B because of two things in mind: data ownership: a data record may now have a User key, thus A can't see B's data. CRUD: anonymous user is READONLY, vs. logged in user can CRUD. This is essentially a role , but without yet separate it into its own entity. The key is that user hierarchy is flat . As soon as you are thinking hierarchy in user, you need now move to type 3. Type 3 : On top of type 2, introduce a role management. If Role is flat, type 3 is just a fancy version of type 2. However, role can be hierarchical, also. data ownership: w/ role, ownership can be User based, or role based (think of your boss can see your data). CRUD: instead of linked to user in type 2, now linked to role . This is the same as position in an org — that employee can change, but function of the position doesn't. In the end, there is really only one design, the type 3 — Type 1 is a special case of 2 (when every user is the same user), and 2 a special case of 3 (when every user is the same role). Top down vs. bottom up Here is the disconnect — In dev/POC, I find it much better to do the bottom up way by starting w/ type 1, the bare minimum, so to focus on the functions first. Once the application is doing what I want, we can slap on top of these auth to make it fancy. But in meetings/projects, type 3 is often the talk because it is theoretically correct ← how can any design be ok w/o thinking upfront of auth? But what they don't realize is that type 1 isn't defected at all. It's only a simplified version of type 3, but it doesn't skip any of the critical ingredients in the design, just that assigning them a default value for the time being. Top down is fine for experienced designer who know how these are fit together, and what default values are used and what they mean. But too often than not, the inexperienced will take the top down approach, but function, or the foundation of the application, suffers exactly because of the complexity it introduces at each turn. This is like teaching 1st graders college math, yes college math is a better version than 1+1 , then? API Authentication Proxy It should be clear by now that API level authentication is a proxy . In the end it will invoke some backend's native authentication mechanism for user checking. Hypothetically speaking API proxy can integrate multiple backend/data sources, thus may present multiple ways to authenticate a user 2 . But assuming you are authenticated, the key question remains — what is the data ownership and CRUD mapping within each application? API key Tastypie creates a new model ApiKey w/ 1:1 relationship to User . When using this authentication, client/frontend is to call w/ username and pwd with a POST , then server/api authenticate this user, and return the key. All subsequent client HTTP calls will have this in the HTTP header, and that's it. Authorization : `ApiKey ${ user } : ${ api_key } ` Remember, because user management is a backend thing, whether the key expires or not is irrelevant in authentication itself. If it expires somehow, client gets an error code/msg. How it handles is a function discussion by itself. Create a Tastypie Auth resource Now as you can see, even Tastypie can neatly package Django model into a resource , a resource doesn't by itself authenticate. Instead, you build a touch point for client to call, whether the URL is /api/v1/<whatever or a dedicated view at /me/blahblah is irrelevant. Below I'm choosing the former because then auth URLs will be part of /api/v1 schema instead of a made-up URL, feels cleaner. An auth dummy resource In some blogs login is exposed w/ User resource/model. However, I think it's better to create a dummy resource for auth purpose only. Therefore, one can abuse this touch point and feel safe because there is model data behind this! class AuthResource ( Resource ): class Meta : allowed_methods = [ \"get\" , \"post\" ] resource_name = \"auth\" authentication = ApiKeyAuthentication () Here I allow both post and get , for we are to login w/ post , and logout with get . For using get to logout, since I'm not passing any user data in post body, I need to use the API key to identify this user, thus it needs authentication=ApiKeyAuthentication so that Tastypie workflow will observe the header for API key. prepend url There is very little info on the doc , but this is the key. The question is, once I have created a resource, how will call to this resource trigger a login!? This is what you do: In the resource, define a class method to handle login details. Use prepend_url to assign a URL linked to this method! In other words, you get your resource URL, ie. /api/v1/auth , but you can define a /auth/whatever in your resource and link to a class method as the handler. So as you can see, this isn't much different from creating a Django view and link to a URL. from django.conf.urls import url class AuthResource ( Resource ): class Meta : allowed_methods = [ \"get\" , \"post\" ] resource_name = \"auth\" authentication = ApiKeyAuthentication () def prepend_urls ( self ): return [ url ( r \"&#94;(?P<resource_name> %s )/login %s $\" % ( self . _meta . resource_name , trailing_slash ()), self . wrap_view ( \"login\" ), name = \"api_login\" , ), url ( r \"&#94;(?P<resource_name> %s )/logout %s $\" % ( self . _meta . resource_name , trailing_slash ()), self . wrap_view ( \"logout\" ), name = \"api_logout\" , ), ] So, the key is self.wrap_view(\"login\") , whereas login is actually a class method which I'll do next. The URL pattern is up to whatever you imagine really. By doing the self._meta.resource_name , you are creating a pattern /<your resource name>/login . Same applies to the logout function. login I wouldn't go into details of the code. The key here is the self.deserialize which gives you a way to extract username and password in the JSON body. Once you have them, call Django's built-in authenticate for the actual work. Here is where you can see proxy hooking up w/ other backends for authentication calls if so. The ApiKey part is to create a key for the user if not presented. Tastypie recommends using model signal so that each new user gets a key always. They all achieve the same end state — one user, one key , therefore key becomes the user. Period. def login ( self , request , ** kwargs ): self . method_check ( request , allowed = [ \"post\" ]) data = self . deserialize ( request , request . body , format = request . META . get ( \"CONTENT_TYPE\" , \"application/json\" ), ) username = data . get ( \"username\" , \"\" ) password = data . get ( \"password\" , \"\" ) user = authenticate ( username = username , password = password ) if user : if user . is_active : # login(request, user) try : key = ApiKey . objects . get ( user = user ) if not key . key : key . save () except ApiKey . DoesNotExist : key = ApiKey . objects . create ( user = user ) return self . create_response ( request , { \"success\" : True , \"data\" : key . key , }, ) else : return self . create_response ( request , { \"success\" : False , \"message\" : \"User is not active\" , }, HttpForbidden , ) else : return self . create_response ( request , { \"success\" : False , \"message\" : \"Login failed\" , }, HttpUnauthorized , logout The key is self.is_authenticated(request) . This will populate request.user w/ the key's user. Otherwise you will always get request.user being AnonymousUser . Of course, you can choose to use post , and have frontend pass back the (user,key) , and have code here to look up the identity. But since I have added authentication = ApiKeyAuthentication() in the resource Meta, the key in the HTTP header will be picked up by Tastypie's get already. Thus making the call a bit cleaner. Further, get is a better shot than post for logging out a user, imho. def logout ( self , request , ** kwargs ): self . method_check ( request , allowed = [ \"get\" ]) # MUST: call to populate User self . is_authenticated ( request ) if request . user and request . user . is_authenticated : logout ( request ) return self . create_response ( request , { \"success\" : True }) else : return self . create_response ( request , { \"success\" : False }, HttpUnauthorized ) This is not only risky, but is often than not, wrong! All language has lib to transform your data model code into API automagically . There is simply no reason to write from scratch. If yours can't, you should consider upgrading the underline data modeling layer, but not to patch it w/ an webservice API. ↩ In some cases, proxy authenticate is really a convenience to bring more users to your application, ie. allow user to use Google account in your application w/o doing any user registration. ↩","tags":"dev","url":"https://fengxia41103.github.io/myblog/react%20key%20authentication%20backend.html"},{"title":"Pig teammate","text":"My friend's recent experience with her pig teammates were both disheartening and sad. So she has been working on renew the lease for her kindergarten for over half year now. The lease runs out on 7/31. Without it, the whole business would have to fold. Then, among the four partners, the woman who is also the 法人 of the business, made up all kinds of shits not to sign this paper by herself. But hey, it isn't an option even, because the landlord insisted 法人 being the only acceptable party for this. So in the end, just one day before the deadline , the four partners got together for a talk (and even for this the woman resisted to the last minute, of course, excuses are cheap and also abundant). After hours of agony, the four signed a new agreement, included all the lines this woman wanted to have , and planned to go in all together, all four of them, on the signing day — three of them being the cheerleader, while this woman put down the signature. So far, business as usual, though there have many BS in between which, if I were my friend, would have dropped the fxxx bomb, \"fxxx it! This isn't even my responsibility! If you want to play game, go fxxx yourself, see if I care.\"... oh well well, so my friend is pretty patient. So here comes the twist, or, should I say, the climax of this BS drama ~~ The night of their agreement, and we are talking just hours now before the signing day, the woman announced, in a casual way , \"oh btw, I went to Macao a few days ago, and just got a notice that I need to be quarantined for 14 days\", then, out of her little shitty brain, she attached a photo copy of the notice, as proof, but then, on paper it says, starting date: 7/31 , and all this was happening the night of 8/3!!!! WTF!!!! Amazing, isn't it!? You know, talking about being both shameless and stupid, unbelievable! So this whole thing is now indeed like dropping a bomb in the lake, because just as I'm writing, China is into another round of strict lockdown and high alert due to new waves of corvid-19 new cases over there. So, she took a trip, fine, her own business, but she didn't reveal this to the partners (which, btw, all call each other friends , wow) either before or during the gathering, then, she thought how convenient and convincing this would be to not show up for the signing, as she has always been wishing, wow, what a scheme!!! Now, all her friends are exposed, potentially, and they now would have to report their risk, and quarantine themselves, also.... what kind of person is this! This is totally fxxx up! So this whole thing is like a reality show to me, and very disturbing. For one, I feel bad for my friend who had to deal with such a nasty situation while she is managing the operation of this entire business as the CEO (the others are just board members, but with unlimited BS power!), and she is the only one who is worried about the lease deadline. But really, how could anyone with a brain not to realize that this lease is one of the two necessary conditions for this business to even exist (the other being a license). So without this lease, they are fxxx-ed. Isn't this as obvious as it can be!? Even if this woman has this crazy tendency, it is just insane to choose this moment to manifest her strong will and god knows what. This is not insanity. This is pure stupidity. And over there I have found a lot of them — they may be smart , in the sense of being cunning and manipulating, but they lack the basic analytical mind, and have no clue what is important and what is secondary. I think they have been so used to the everything is possible, everything is by my will kind of baby arrogance, that they dismiss any written agreement even they had signed it, any words they have said, any plan they have agreed... just by a whim of will, she thinks the whole earth will stop and turn the other way, if she says so. I don't understand why a person could think this way, because this is really to me unthinkable, not part of a possibility. But these, dreamers ?, can certain dream, dare to wish, and no hesitation to demand. Back in the days, I would have said that one day life will teach them the lesson, and they would fall/hurt. But now, honestly, I don't wish them these at all. Be successful as they are, be rich as they are, being as sincerely believing in whatever they believe in as they do, carry on, your path is fine, just that I wish no part of it, and would never want to take. That's all.

Some wall street hedge fund guy said DIDI was a political terrorism by the Chinese government against US investors.... now I think the decision of k12 education is even worse than that — it's a terrorism on people's brain, in particular, on kids whose future is yet to be unfolded, but now shut. This reminds the Christianity before the reformation, that yes there is God, but guess what, you can't get hold of a bible (because it's sacred and rare and expansive, a book was expansive in general), and you can't talk to Him directly except through priest, and his message is only known to you layman through the mouth of our priests, by their interpretation... what changed this was the printing technology. Now book becomes cheaper, layman can now afford a copy, of course, the more forbidden it is, the better price it can fetch for the seller, so now there are more copies in people's hands, and led to more opinion/interpretation of the idea , which then caused individual to think why I have to speak to Him through a middleman, and btw, that middleman hasn't been correct, nor consistent, nor even honest by many measures, so was the reformation...In other words, I'm wondering, if we are to kill K12, what's the basis to support it? Reformation was founded on printing, what will this move be founded upon? I think it has to be technology, also. Ideology is just, talk. In order to achieve anything physically different, the mindware itself isn't enough, it has to marry with something real, something fundamental in people's daily life, in order to has its effect. So, technology. Here is a paper published by some US researchers on the GFW , quite entertaining to read actually, because again, it's an example how ridiculously crude the implementation is as a trademark of the craftsmanship of so called engineering work over there. This reminds me the BS back in the 90s when some company received this tremendous amount of fund by the government, developed an anti-virus software which blacklisted also porn sites and others, but its data files were locally stored (grantedly the Internet was not yet as it is today), and were deciphered within a day by Carnegie Mellon, and results published (as study paper if I recall), and the blacklist became a comprehensive yellow page to all the porn sites which I didn't know, but now know :) hahaha.... not only because Carnegie is good, but the company only used the common zip to zip its data file, and didn't have any particular tech edge in the space of so called security, implementation was probably good enough to fool a computer-illiterate, but to ppl like Carnegie or myself, the clue is as obvious as daylight. So it's the same in many of the projects I got involved since, and so is this GFW paper reveals — for god sake, how stupid could it be to create a regex that miss fires on any DNS contains \"99\"!.. I mean, come on, where is your test data set? Have you ever measured your false positive rate and false negative rate?...oh well. Priest is nothing but a channel of knowledge, knowledge as the product, and ppl as the consumer. Therefore, any control is only to decide which of the three parts one want, or can, control. Apparently, producers are not doable these days anymore. Back in the days, there was only one copy of the Bible (presumably only one copy as the real one, though I'm sure many different versions were in circulation), like there is only brand of car you can buy, the \"you can have any color you want as long as it is black\". But now, many of the producers are outside its control, abroad for example, and many consumers are also producers (as everyone is publishing all kinds of ideas/opinions all the time). Therefore, it is not possible to control that end. What about the receiving end? Well, in the way that is exactly what has been, by telling you what you should like/dislike, what you buy, and so on, brainwash, propaganda, whatever the name is called, the whole point is to construct a Truman's world, that you would be made to believe the sky is actually pink, if I so decide. However, this becomes a sheer number game — with that many brains walking around, it's hard to identify outlier, and it's hard to prevent new outliers, either. Even with them being the minority, it's concerning because the system is based on uniformity, like a dam, can't afford the slightest crack. This leaves to the only option, which is the channel. Now this becomes a pure business case — five force. Who are your competitors? Who are your alternatives? ... then, of course, the ideal setup is, monopoly. By being the only player in the field, a business gains the most power over consumer and vendor, and maximizes its profits while sacrificing both ends. Of course it has been universally proven to be a bad idea because it is super wasteful. But, if nothing stops you, any business naturally grows towards monopoly, so will be a government, and I believe this is happening. So K12 is just yet another step in the direction of monopoly. This time, the vendor is the knowledge and ideas, and the consumers are, k12. If human mind has infinite capacity and possibility to create something good and wonderful as if a lightening has struck, then it is equally elasticity to be compressed, depressed, distorted, without showing much sign of damage... I don't know what this is going to be. But I firmly believe, a damage is a damage, like a bug, you pay the price sooner or later, if you are aware of it but not to fix it.","tags":"thoughts","url":"https://fengxia41103.github.io/myblog/new%20oriental.html"},{"title":"Heat, Evening","text":"What is this?

The call to Aunt Tam after Uncle Tam passed away? Probably. Hearing her voice is both making me less worried about her, and worried, at the same time. Listening to this video, the two stand up comedians, talked about their divorce. I don't have any particular feel of any of the two, yet, when they were reading letters written to each other, it felt, pain. Yes, pain, a tremendous pain... I can't picture myself sitting there to read out loud a letter addressed to me from someone so dear in life, it will be, too hard. I don't know. Maybe it reminds me my life. Maybe it's the heat, or the evening, playing guitar always brings me through time, through space, as if I were sitting on the stool looking at that remote hill w/ the pagoda, it's a place so far far far away, but I'm glad I was there, feel like it was long long long time ago, almost like watching a movie, but which music to put on? I couldn't think of a song, not a song, that would fit the tune, I don't know, it's a moment in life that is dear, deeply buried, can not forget. Maybe it's all of these, the stories, the people, the places I went, the words I spoke, the sunsets I watched, the another-me at that place, at that time. Life is indeed a sand in hand, dripping away, no return, no pause, not even much of a start, nor an end, yea there is an end to it, but it isn't death, really, I start to wonder maybe there is an after life, or another life, or many many rounds of life after, merry go around, but not a merry I guess, each round, is another play unfold, another story to be told, another so many years of pulling through, but having no past, nor future, just another cycle, going around. Sunset is as pretty as everyday. Heat wave is abating a little w/ some gentle breeze. Life is not bad actually. Can't complain really.

Then in the evening we took a walk around Brooklyn. Watching people go by, sitting here and there, all colors, all kinds, some in gym clothes, some jogging, some heading home perhaps, some hanging out w/ friends, some just wondering around, some w/ family, some look like a student, some homeless or the like, walking by a couple gyms and see people working out inside... noise, humming and talking and loud cars and motorcycles, everywhere, w/ the backdrop a beautiful evening air decorated by a magnificent hue of red in the sky, it felt, both alive, and struggling. In a city of over 10 million people, walking on the street, living in this corner of the giant map, makes you feel insignificant, absolutely nobody. Motorbikes for food deliveries are becoming a city scene, as if I were in Shanghai. All these people, are living somewhere, making a living somehow, doing something, trying (I suppose) to find him/her self. It is overwhelming. For the first time I start to understand that city life is a lot to take. Out of these 10 million people, what is the odds you could meet someone who likes you also? I don't know. There are plenty couples on the street, in restaurants, friends chatting to each other, all dress well, all pretty to look at. Yet, I feel it's a city of reality show almost, that they each holding onto each other, so each feels not completely alone, feels belong to, even though I don't know what that means, belonging to, what? The city? the place? the people they know? career? dream?... what is it? Why doing the work out in a gym on this street? For pleasing yourself? Then what?... It's a need of an identity, that as a sand on a beach, each still yearns to have one uniqueness whatever it may be.

Good thing that both daughters are here, so he went with all his families near by. It's never easy, but this is the best one could wish for. Thought of scenes playing badminton w/ him in MIT. Felt like forever ago. Hard to believe, yet, it's the way it is. Traveling in train for the first time in US in my life. Felt quite like the one in China. Four hours went by quickly w/ Noah playing Sanguo. I think he go the hang of it towards the end. Towns passing by, ocean side at CT, reminded me the drives along the coast when I was young, single, and enjoying my car. It was good times. But don't know why. This trip, and regardless where I went, I felt like a visitor. I couldn't feel I belong to these places anymore. I feel I'm just traveling, like traveling in China on Dad's trip — everywhere was a foreign place to me, both interesting and, irrelevant. I'm just passing by, and not even feeling of myself, like a soul walking outside a body, watching the body going through these physical spaces, experiencing these foods, drinks, scenes, but the soul is only a bystander, feeling nothing. I don't know why. I think that, after living in 517 for a year, not only there is few places that could match the comfort it has, but I start to think that a lovely space, just like a good looking clothes, doesn't change a thing in your life, well, I mean, it doesn't solve a thing for you — what troubles you remains, the trouble doesn't go away, you are still just, you, so in the end, all these are just tiny breathing gaps, like mirages, look super good, but they are not real. So are these travels. Have to say, walking in Coolidge Corner this morning feels good, nice neighbourhood, walkable here and there, familiar shops, and memories. Yet, the memories make the feeling harder when I think of selling this place for good, like cutting the cord of a baby — from this point on, attachment no more, all became past, buried in the past ← I'm gonna miss you, miss this place, miss the myself who had lived here, walked here, thought this home, thought that nothing would have changed to the way they are now.

What should I do?","tags":"thoughts","url":"https://fengxia41103.github.io/myblog/boston%202021.html"},{"title":"Mio on the Shore","text":"It has been a long time, I think, to finish a movie like this, without playing anything in my hand, just sitting there, watching, watching it without much thought even, of what the story is about, and where it is going. Like a leave floating on a lake, wave after wave, it goes, here, there, goes, waving around, may end up here, or there, or, nowhere. I think I have been too used to having the mind occupied, by work, by book, by idea, by an anxiety that time is slipping off my hand, that I'm getting older and older each day, and it's such an undesirable feeling, that I feel compelled to think of something, to make the time count. But hell. Life is pretty pointless, it is a journey, a journey that has no map, no agenda, no purpose, just a process, someone somehow puts you on the map, and you have to move, here and there, till the end of it, and no tell what the end is, or where it is. Watching so much suffering in this world, in my short life, among friends and family, expecting a trip to Boston to see uncle Tam next week w/ Noah, all these, add to the feeling of pointless. It's funny that the China project received an award yesterday. What a surprise! I feel I did the least to this project, yet, it brings award, reward, congratulations... I would have thought it ironical in the past, not anymore, it's the life itself, it's the truth of life, the only one, 真是无心插柳柳成荫, what do u know, really? Makes wonder, what is life? what should I do next? Any sense to expect, anything? Then what's the point of the rest of my time, what for?... Like her name, Mio, like the sound of a cat meowing, cute. So it's life, a slow paced life, like a slow moving train, clonking clonking clonking, unpleasant, not stopping, just clonking, clonking. Maybe that's why I start to like these Japanese movies, sometimes even make me wonder that being old is to have a fragile mind, that I cant enjoy or see the excitements as I used to, instead, it's the slow motion thing, being it a movie, a music, a train, a cloud, my cats, it's the slowness that makes me peace. I guess this is the right way to grow, to spend time with yourself, as insignificant as a person is comparing to this world, it really feels like a peckle of dust, disappearing from this world, but makes no difference, and no one would bother to notice.. a wind would go by, brush it off the face of this earth, and that would be it. Spoke to Jookun the other day. He is under a lot of stress these days. Understand. Kid is leaving nest for college, Uncle Tam is letting go his fight... it feels sad. I imagined the moment I went to see him, both happy and sad. I don't know how well I would hold, I'll try, even though I really don't know. Well, even if I cry, so let it be, it's how I feel then, and I am sad that he is leaving us for good... All the older generation has such a day, but w/ all these mental preparations, it makes slight difference when it's here, just like sometimes I looked back at my own life, at the dates and loves and breakups, I could rationalize all of them w/ my words and thoughts, but in the end, they all felt sad, profoundly sad, like a cliff and endless land, no end, no end. I used to think my function is to bring happiness to people around me, to make their lives better because of me, and I used to think this is one thing I could do well, and will continue to do so, if all else fail me. Now, I don't know. I still try, but I feel it's a wall right in front of my eyes, I don't know now whether I could climb over it, I even think there is no point of battling because I'm doomed to lose. Funny the only courage I'm picking up is to think of my mom — as much as I have an opinion of her, she has courage, and that is indeed respectful. I also start to realize how life is going to abandon everyone, eventually, and living to your own heart is such a difficult thing that, for me, I have been extremely lucky to do so in most of the my life so far. Sometimes I wonder how much longer this life is going to be, maybe it is young, maybe it's ending, both are, unpleasant. I don't know. Haven't written for a while. Couldn't feel myself, what to write, no urge, no thoughts, not much feelings either. Tried to keep myself busy, but that's totally illusion. Yes there are plenty things in life to fix and to keep moving. But no, they are all superficial to the point that I know it's not me, not how I felt.

Over the last few years I found myself more and more sensitive to these fallacies and, like new parents who all of sudden seeing kids everywhere which they never noticed before theirs was born, I see and hear these fallacies all over the place. They are so prevalent that I seriously wonder whether there is a way to make these knowledge/training more accessible to large population so that people can start applying them in their day-2-day life. I know the idea is likely hopeless ← after all, how many of us even remember or utilize the knowledge and training we have had from school years? But still, I think it's worth an effort to promote them, and even without leaving a mark and changing a person, I believe having a louder voice would eventually make them heard, by a few, and the number of those few would be growing. category formal fallacy : error in argument's form. propositional fallacy : an error that concerns compound propositions. This is an error in compounded bool logics, eg. if A and B can only be True when both A & B are true. Think like coding. quantification fallacy : the quantifiers of the premises are in contradiction to the quantifier of the conclusion. formal syllogistic fallacies : logical fallacies that occur in syllogisms. informal fallacy : premise is weak. This is the most prevalent family of fallacies I see in everyday life. -faulty generalization Faulty generalization Ah, generalization ! I thought I was going nuts when I wrote that blog, because it felt so common sense so that I felt it is completely inevitable. Yet in some many times I felt so, wrong! But I couldn't pinpoint what went wrong. I mean, I could argument what the logic didn't stand, or at least, was weak/insufficient, but I couldn't really categorize it so to know exactly why it was so. But here, wiki is my friend. At least now I start to learn what these generalizations are all about — in layman's term, this is when we jump to a conclusion of a group when only small number of samples have been presented so. Faulty generalization comes in many flavors which will be discussed in details below. The overall theme is that the arguer makes a conclusion on a faulty sample — samples too small, biased, exceptions are deliberated ignored or excluded altogether without giving a consideration or a reason... therefore, without presenting the entire picture, the conclusion is not only skewed, but could have been pre-determined, thus the argument isn't even genuine at all but w/ only an aim to win his argument, so what I would call arguing for arguing's sake 1 . representative sampling Before going into generalization, let's look at this, sampling. The entire category of faulty generalization is pointing to this exact concept being misused in various forms. Sampling is a deep topic on itself. The key here is that without defining clearly the space of the samples covered in a discussion, there has simply no point of further argument because arguer can/will apply techniques to build case, thus inevitably committing the faults illustrated below. Continue to argue upon such faulty foundation would go nowhere. So, the notes below are to help us identify and pinpoint exactly what technique is used in hiding these shaky samples. So, what is representative sampling? First of all, it is not always random sampling , because fundamentally it should be determined by definition of the characteristics the group has in your view! For example, if we are to investigate something about man vs. woman in this world, random sampling N men vs. N women is only representative if we share the assumption that population is roughly half men vs. half women! But moving this to some geo where the number of men is quite more than one of women, random sampling is clearly not representative anymore! Therefore, one should first define these characteristics, thus serving as the outter-most boundary of the following argument. Once we are both clear about what we are to mean, we then move on to examine these samples against its group. Only when we consider the samples being representative should we embark the argument. Otherwise, it's just a waste of time. hasty generalization Quite a few alternative calling of the same idea: proof by example Underpowered generalization Illicit generalization Fallacy of insufficient sample Generalization from the particular Leaping to a conclusion Blanket statement Hasty induction Law of small numbers Unrepresentative sample Secundum quid They all mean the same thing, that: X is true for A. X is true for B. Therefore, X is true for C, D, E, etc. The key here is that the evidence is not sufficient . I like the example in wiki (below) because I see this played out everywhere in form of a tourist commenting a new place, of its people, or the so called bias against 河南人 , etc. For example, if a person travels through a town for the first time and sees 10 people, all of them children, they may erroneously conclude that there are no adult residents in the town. What's the cure!? Fundamentally, the challenge should be directed at sophist's sample group: how many samples out of the group s/he is basing the claim on, and how do we know the sample is representative , eg. selected randomly. In other words, one must present his/her sample selection criteria and procedure in order to allow examination of sample bias — this is truly the most common fault of garbage in, garbage out sceario — if I screwed the sample, whether intentionally or not, I have certainly screwed the result. when it is correct I didn't expect this one! I thought faulty generalization are all, wrong. But, boy, am I wrong! There are indeed cases when faulty generalization, a logic fallacy, leads to correct conclusion . However, they are only so under a condition: if it leads from a singular premise to an existential conclusion (i.e. proving that a claim is true for at least one case, instead of for all cases) -- Ref: proof by example So, if the claim is only applied to eliminate an absolute (eg. absolutely all this or all that), then yes, this works. slothful induction This is the opposite to hasty generalization, wiki has a pretty good example: An example of slothful induction might be that of a careless man who has had twelve accidents in the last six months and it is strongly evident that it was due to his negligence or rashness, yet keeps insisting that it is just a coincidence and not his fault. Its logical form is: evidence suggests X results in Y, yet the person in question insists Y was caused by something else. Searching for \"how to rebut slothful induction\" didn't come up much. But I hit on a [tweeter post] about Corvid-19 vs. flu, pretty good one, and boy, I feel ashamed now, that I have committed the same fallacy as this author has pointed out. Here, the author pointed out that we are jumping to conclusion because the existing premises are not sufficient to the conclusion. The argument here is that COVID-19 deaths are less than flu deaths therefore COVID-19 is less of a threat. But this argument is logically invalid: the conclusion doesn't follow from the premises. Therefore you need to add any hidden assumptions that make the argument valid. Rather, there is another hidden premise (P3) , that death toll by Corvid will continue to be less than the flu, which apparently is not: Therefore, by ignoring the evidence of Corvid death, the statement that Corvid is less than a flu was committing this slothful induction fallacy. Brilliant. overwhelming exception This is an interesting one. I can't say where I encounter this. The samples by wiki seem to be mostly used in comedies. The key of this fallacy is in its qualifications , which will eliminate so many exceptions of the claim that essentially makes the original claim nothing but an empty shell. What comes to mind is the famous model T color choice: Any customer can have a car painted any colour that he wants, so long as it is black. -- by Henry Ford So, watch out for qualification that creates exceptions. accident Came across this website , excellent example: Birds normally can fly. Tweety the Penguin is a bird. Therefore, Tweety can fly. What went wrong? The key is in the first statement, \"Birds normally can fly.\" — it is a rule of thumb, which is generally true but has exception , and the 2nd line apparently is that exception! rule of thumb What is a rule of thumb? It's easier to see what it is not: universal generalization : A 100% or 0% statistical generalization, that is, a proposition that asserts that something is true of all or none of a class. statistical generalization : A proposition which asserts something of a percentage of a class. Universal generalizations are the special cases when the percentage equals 100% or 0%. Now, rule of thumb vs. universal generalization: the former has exception. Now, rule of thumb vs. statistical generalization: the former actually has a hidden context , but that context is not applicable to the case in point. In the example above, if we take the context of Antarctica alone, Penguin will be the majority bird there, and viola, the rule of thumb there should be \"birds don't fly!\" The rule of thumb is often spoken in a context that are close to the speaker and his/her audiences' common life experience, therefore, \"Clearly, then, rules of thumb are specific to a cultural and temporal context.\" All in all, rule of thumb has exception, and it's the exception that makes the accident fallacy. no true Scotsman A particular form of Accident fallacy is this, also known as appeal to purity , because the key to this fallacy is that the arguer makes a generalization w/o considering exception (thus, is an Accident). However, rather then admitting the fault, he tries to exclude exceptions so to validate his generalization. wiki gives a good example: Person A: \"No Scotsman puts sugar on his porridge.\" Person B: \"But my uncle Angus is a Scotsman and he puts sugar on his porridge.\" Person A: \"But no true Scotsman puts sugar on his porridge.\" Here, the key is the last line, by using the word true , A has modified his original generalization (all scotsman) by excluding some unwanted samples (now all scotsman are divided into two camps: true and not true), but using word such as \"emotionally charged but nonsubstantive purity platitudes such as 'true, pure, genuine, authentic, real'\" to hide such modification. Therefore, three conditions are needed to identify this fallacy: not publicly retreating from the initial, falsified assertion offering a modified assertion that definitionally excludes a targeted unwanted counterexample using rhetoric to hide the modification Sneaky, isn't it? cherry picking Cherry picking, suppressing evidence, or the fallacy of incomplete evidence is the act of pointing to individual cases or data that seem to confirm a particular position while ignoring a significant portion of related and similar cases or data that may contradict that position. This sounds quite the same as ignoring exceptions. I think the key difference is that cherry picking isn't targeted to exclude exception. It's simply a fault when samples are ignored. Of course, the method and the intention to formulate such ignoring will then make the case stronger in name of Accident and so on. Therefore, cherry picking can be viewed as a general category of such symptom. anecdotal evidence How interesting ! This is exactly the things I hear all the time, and it has a name rings this bell — \"person who\" fallacy ! \"I know a person who...\"; \"I know of a case where...\" In short, it \"is a factual claim relying only on personal observation, collected in a casual or non-systematic manner\". This evidence is not automatically false. Rather, the condition is whether this evidence can be verified using scientific method — if it can, then evidence may have value (if proved by the investigation). Otherwise, it's a fallacy. This is a form of cherry picking because the evidence by definition is biased ← I know somebody... which means my evidence came from my close circle, which automatically excluded majority of human race whom I don't know ~~~ What a pity. correlative-based fallacies Correlative conjunction \"is a relationship between two statements where one must be false and the other true\". So be careful, it's not just correlation, but must be opposite to each other . In coding term, the conditions must be mutually exclusive so that no third code path could occur, eg. if A > 10 is one side, then a correlative conjunction is formed when the other side is: else , or if A <=10 . But merely if A < 10 will be a bug, because when A==10 , it has no handler. Now, these type of fallacies are to play with this correlative definition: Presenting two as if they are the correlative conjunctions, but they are not → false dilemma. Denying the correlative: introduce a 3rd option into the correlatives. In other words, when presented a Yes-No question, the answer is anything other than Y-N, 答非所问. Suppressed correlative: try to redefine one correlative so that they lose contrast . false dilemma/false correlative This is a good one. It is \"based on a premise that erroneously limits what options are available\". This picture illustrates the point well: false dilemma (credit: [wiki][14]) This is also a common case in everyday's communication, when I sometimes plays this devil to Noah by presenting to him only two options: doing his homework A or homework B ~~ Apparently he would grow out of this dilemma by one day realizing he could also go out and play, or just ignore me entirely, and I could do nothing about, hahaha. This isn't cherry picking because the problem isn't in the sample, but in its conclusion (only two options presented while more options are deliberately excluded by default 2 ). denying the correlative Pretty straightforward. When asked a Y/N question, you don't answer w/ yes or not, but something else, as if it is also an option (which it must not be): Judge: So did you kill your landlord or not? Kirk: I fought with him. suppressed correlative This can be called fallacy of relativity , because the key here is one makes the original contrast impossible by changing the definition, or mudding the definition's scope. This is especially true when adjectives are used, eg. \"good man\" vs. \"evil man\", well, I could claim any man good or evil when I shift around its definition, couldn't I!? What a mess. argument to moderation \"Also known as false compromise, argument from middle ground, and the golden mean fallacy\" (ref: wiki ). I like the example in wiki: An example of a fallacious use of the argument to moderation would be to regard two opposed arguments — one person saying that the sky is blue, while another claims that the sky is in fact yellow, and conclude that the truth is that the sky is green. While green is the colour created by combining blue and yellow, therefore being a compromise between the two positions, the sky is obviously not green, demonstrating that taking the middle ground of two positions does not always lead to the truth. In particular, I like the phrase that \"the middle ground between the big lie of Soviet propaganda and the truth was itself a lie, and one should not be looking for a middle ground between information and disinformation.\" disinformation Fascinating ! It is \"false information with the intention to deceive public opinion\". In today's world, this is synonymous to a lie and propaganda. continuum fallacy/wronger than wrong This is a good explanation. P1: X is one extreme and Y is the opposite extreme. P2: There is no definable point where X becomes Y. C: Therefore, there is no difference between X and Y. \"In general, the fallacy takes situations where no clear cut-off point between X and Y exists, and either a) denies that any distinction really exists and commits an equivocation between both or b) takes advantage of the lack of distinction by arbitrarily shifting the distinction to unrealistic positions.\" The key in this fallacy is to downplay a stopping point between the two extremes. In other words, even when there is a clear line when one transits from one state/extreme into another, the fallacy says there isn't , thus is the trick. But what if the line isn't there? Ah! So be careful, this fallacy isn't about definition of the line, but that it's ignoring the degree of truthfulness of the two extremes. For example, saying \"earth is flat\" as one extreme and \"earth is round\" as the other, are both actually incorrect (earth isn't pure round, but an oblate spheroid ). However, the degree of it being flat is magnitudely not truth than its being round. Therefore, it's a fallacy to claim both are equally false because both are not true. This is further discussed in wronger than wrong . argument from ignorance The pattern of this fallacy is this: Statement p is unproved → Not-p is true. Statement not-p is unproved → p is true. I think this the exact logic behind the phrase 敌人的敌人一定是朋友 ← of course this is not true, because s/he could also be another enemy, or a neutral. This seems obvious that even in the space of p vs. not-p , which form a correlative conjunction, not proving p doesn't warrant the not-p is now true — eg. because you can't prove me a male, doesn't automatically make me a female. This one is quite confusing because it sound very much to the \"If A, then B → if not B, then not A\" logic. But they are different. The latter is strictly correct, but this fallacy is not. This fallacy is saying, if you can't prove not B leads to A , then not B must lead to not A, therefore, becomes correct. This fallacy is a common technique to shift the burden of proof , meaning that arguer takes a position in this fallacy, but without backing himself up w/ evidence, simply asking the rebuttal to prove the not-p , and if s/he can't, arguer wins ← this is pretty BS, isn't it? But, be careful, this has non-fallacious uses in science, law and some specific application. For practical reason, one must assume the not-p is true is you can't prove the p . For example, \"the assumption of innocence until proved guilty\" is a practical, not a logical, process. In this, p=guilty , if you can't prove p , the not-p=innocent must be assumed . equivocation 谐音梗, or 偷换概念. ambiguous middle term Since only man [human] is rational. And no woman is a man [male]. Therefore, no woman is rational. \"The first instance of \"man\" implies the entire human species, while the second implies just those who are male.\" Equivocation, however, is a great example of humor ~~ This, in more strict term, is called fallacy of four terms , because the double-meaning word introduced a fourth term while exactly three and three alone can be there. Using the examples from wiki : Valid, three terms: goldfish, fish, and fin. Major premise: All fish have fins. Minor premise: All goldfish are fish. Conclusion: All goldfish have fins. Invalid, fourth term: human. Major premise: All fish have fins. Minor premise: All goldfish are fish. Conclusion: All humans have fins. Now as you can see, in equivocation fallacy, though not a new word is introduced, but the meaning of one of the three terms has been changed from one context to another, thus make actually 4 instead of 3! Again, using the example above: Since only man [human] is rational. And no woman is a man [male]. Therefore, no woman is rational. On surface, three terms: man, woman, and rational. But the word \"man\" has actually two meanings: human, and male. Therefore, the total terms in this have now four: human, male, woman, rational. And by definition, two premises are not sufficient to validate the conclusion, therefore is a fallacy. Brilliant! Motte & Bailey This is a bit difficult one. By presenting two similar points, one controversial and one less so, the arguer is actually promoting the controversial one, but when attacked, s/he uses the less controversial version (pretending these two are identical) for defense. Person A asserts [Controversial Interpretation of Viewpoint X]. Person B critiques [Controversial Interpretation of Viewpoint X]. Person A asserts that they were actually defending [Common-Sense Interpretation of Viewpoint X]. Person B no longer has grounds to critique Person A; Person B leaves the discussion. Person A claims victory and discreetly reverts to actually supporting [Controversial Interpretation of Viewpoint X]. This leads to persuasive definition , because language can \"simultaneously communicate information (informative) and feelings (expressive)\", and the persuasive definition focuses on the expressive part, the feeling part. This is where the M&B comes in — the Beiley is the controversial one, the informative piece, where Motte is the expressive piece, the non-controversial piece. When Beiley is attacked, the arguer evokes the expressive piece for defense, and when attacker agrees or gives up , s/he switches to Beiley and claims it is valid. This strategy is very common when emotionally charged words are used, eg. love, freedom, patriotic... they are all imprecise and emotional. Therefore, when one says 你不怎样就不是中国人, the Beiley is the 事， the 怎样， and the Motte is the 是中国人 — apparently, citizenship is determined by some kind of law, while I can disagree w/ the 事儿 however way I want without breaking that law. Now writing this, this also feels like a false dilemma, as if my option is only either \"do the thing and be a 中国人\"， or \"not do it and not being a 中国人\". I don't know whether this example is a good M&B one, but this is what I understand it to be. false of accent Reminds me the poem when one changes accent to change it's meaning entirely. I didn't take the test yesterday. (Somebody else did.) I didn't take the test yesterday. (I did not take it.) I didn't take the test yesterday. (I did something else with it.) I didn't take the test yesterday. (I took a different one.) I didn't take the test yesterday. (I took something else.) I didn't take the test yesterday . (I took it some other day.) fallacy of composition This is similar to the hasty generalization. This is also making a conclusion only by seeing part of the whole. wiki has some good examples: If someone stands up out of their seat at a cricket match, they can see better. Therefore, if everyone stands up, they can all see better. Some people can become millionaires with the right business concept. Therefore, if everyone has the right business concept, everyone will become a millionaire. If a runner runs faster, he can win the race. Therefore, if all the runners run faster, they can all win the race. Now, there are also some examples which are super common (as fallacy): Since every part of a certain machine is light in weight, the machine as a whole is light in weight. Here is a tricky one. \"In society, if all voters are rational, by majority rule their collective choice will be rational.\" ← not true ! So again, the key here is the sum of components don't necessarily bear the characteristic the arguer is wishing to promote. But then, what does this make education? Also, what about individual's abiding laws and being a good citizen, if individual's don't translate into the whole? ← wouldn't this make better sense if the fallacy has a statistical threshold, such as \"if over 50% of the parts have this trait, the whole is likely to have it, too\"? Well, in the weight example above, this won't work either. I think the problem of this fallacy isn't about composition, but is that the conclusion has a hidden assumption which is not examined, and will be violated when we move from individual to a whole. For example, in the millionaire example, the hidden line is that there are buyers, so the fallacy is implying that if you had right biz, all others will be buyers... well, even this can be correct, that everyone buys someone else' product & service, thus all become millionaire, except that million dollars would then become less valuable if everyone had it. So it's really its effect, or the hidden assumption, is the problem here. fallacy of division This is the opposite to the fallacy of composition. Here we are drawing conclusion of a part from characteristic of a whole. The second grade in Jefferson elementary eats a lot of ice cream Carlos is a second-grader in Jefferson elementary Therefore, Carlos eats a lot of ice cream false attribution This fallacy is difficult to eliminate because this is really everywhere. Misquoting or crediting to the wrong source is too easily happen to be curable. The Matthew effect is interesting. Basically it's saying the more you have, the more you will; the more famous you are today, the more famous you will be tomorrow.... disheartening, isn't this!? false equivalence Ah, this is a good one. This is to compare apple to orange. By using a similarity between two, it draws the conclusion that they are the same/equivalent. Of course, the equivalence is fallacy if: The differences are in different magnitude: being a petty thief and being a murder are both criminals, but drawing the line that they are the same is a fallacy because they are difference degrees of criminality. Using a similarity which has nothing to do w/ the claim. \"They're both living animals that metabolize chemical energy. Therefore there's little difference between having a pet cat and a pet snail.\" The \"equivalence\" is in factors that are not relevant to the animals' suitability as pets. Exactly. historian's fallacy This is the God's view . We know the consequence of a historical event. But the ppl living in that event did not. Therefore, analysis and evaluation must be conducted only based on things they knew, not we know today. I'm surprised that this fallacy is only identified in 1880 and later names in 1970!! This is rather quite new, and make me wonder what all the analysis before these times were like, I mean, didn't they then commit this fallacy, thus requiring a new round of re-evaluation? If so, has it been done? and doesn't this lead to that each historical work should require a scrutiny/test of all these fallacies? Sounds overkill, but is alternative acceptable? I don't know. presentism This sounds very much like the God's view , also. So let me try to clarify these two. The historian's fallacy is about judging a history as if the consequence had been known by the doers; presentism is to pass on a judgment, in particular, in moral sense, using today's standard. For example, I think Corvid is a case in point of historian's fallacy — I admire fully the story of Dr. Li , but I don't think it's not a good evidence to support criticism of Chinese government's negligence, because people who might have heard the wind of this virus were few, and knowing such news from any unofficial channel was both confusing and incredible — so, I agree that the government committed negligence by not making the information public; but I disagree using Dr. Li as the pawn to attack its negligence. I think the case lies rather suppressing freedom of speech rather than of a prophet whose prophecy was ignored. Presentism is very difficult, in my opinion, to both avoid or to be criticized, even. When we pass on a judgment on a historical event, eg. foot bondage was a sin against female, it is inevitable using today's moral standard as the reference. I don't defend these histories being a sin or even a crime. But I do think it requires us to also include discussion of how it was viewed back then in the discussion . Further, I think the key problem of presentism is in selection of evidence — if one deliberately ignore or downplay a set of events mostly/purely based on his present standard , then presentism is really a cherry picking fallacy. homunculus fallacy This fallacy is a recursion function goes wrong by having a stop condition. Response to the question is not answered, but is deflected , in a disguise that seems right at first, but if pushing to ask more, will reveal that it's an infinite regression . It seems the popular example used for this one is the vision. If we explain how human has vision by saying a man in your brain is watching a movie, then this leads to how he is receiving the movie, another man in his brain, and so it regression continues..... I don't think this a good example, actually. But for now, it's ok. The key of this fallacy is that response didn't answer the question, but using a middle man figure, the homunculus , as the answer, as if it's then self-evident (which is not), therefore creating this recursion. inflation of conflict I like this one . Authority A disagrees with authority B on issue X. Therefore, we can say nothing meaningful about issue X. \"This is a form of black and white thinking -- either we know the exact truth, or we know nothing at all.\" \"A disagreement among experts does not mean that both are wrong, the answer is a compromise, or that there is no answer to be known; it simply means that there is disagreement -- that is all we can infer.\" relativist fallacy This is 庄子 , but in a fallacious way. The relativist fallacy (or subjectivist fallacy) is a logical fallacy that occurs when it is asserted that some fact may be true for some people but not true for others. This is not to ignore differences in culture, custom and the like. Rather, the key feature of this fallacy isn't in it's relative position, but in the fact that the person \"uses a mid-argument, ad hoc switch to a relativistic view of truth in order to defend some position, which they had previously asserted was objective\". Therefore, this makes the argument to halt because this makes the claim unfalsifiable ← what I all arguing to win for arguing's sake. incomplete comparison What a fallacy ! This is exactly the topic I was saying earlier this morning w/ her daughter, that English grammar requires you to observer reasoning, such that you have to have a counterpart when using \"better than\" (than what!?), or \"best of\" (a group of 3 or more!). But here it is, the fallacy is by breaking these rules, thus making a claim \"My product is better\" ← completely unrefutable because it is incomplete . inconsistent comparison This is interesting. product X is less expensive than product A, has better quality than product B, and has more features than product C What's wrong!? Ah. So the intention is to say that X is the best. But by having 3 categories here — price, quality, and feature, all we could derive is that X is not the bottom of all three categories, but it may be 3rd place in all categories, while A might be the ace in 2 out of three of these categories, thus being a much better product! This is the same fallacy, though jokingly, saying that I'm the best coder in novelist, the best novelist in chef, and so on ~~ kettle logic Forget about Freud's original example. This is a better one: In the movie \"Philomena\", Steve Coogan's character, Martin Sixsmith, leaves a church ceremony early. When asked why he says, \"I don't believe in God, and I think he knows.\" So 前言不搭后语, conflicting to among itself. Remember, the whole point of argument, or logic, is to seek the truth of the subject, not to beat down your opponent. Alas! In politics and even in life, how many participant would remember this when emotion takes hold, or agenda is the boss? ↩ By default is another common pattern one should watch out for, because it indicates an assumption.

I don't know why. I'm drawn to human faces. Since now over 17 years ago when I was working at Bit9 and started taking a lot of photos, I had compiled a folder called people , because when I was going through all the shots, I found myself always had hard time to remove/delete portrait shots — somehow, I felt each moment of a person, being it as random and non-purposeful as most of my shots were, it was still a moment of life, a moment that s/he and I shared together, like two parallel lines in space and time, suddenly across once, and only once and never again.. it's a mysterious feeling. I don't know what it is, and I certainly lack the art to describe it w/ my word and writing. Maybe that's why I kept those photos, that an image is worth a thousand words, maybe, that it has more power than I, to convey the idea, the feeling. Everytime I looked at a portrait, drawn to the eyes, shining like a whole galaxy in itself, it is, magical. And indeed. Like the Humans in New York , I can't help finding them, wonderful. I know it's a filtered collection of samples, like a catalog of super models, of course, they are wonderful to look at. But then, there are also documentaries , yeah I know they are also edited, but still, the shots moved me deeply. I don't like studio shots, and in general, I don't like staged shots, touched-up shots, post-processing, perfect composition, all that... but I like candid shots, like to look at a random person walking on the street, minding his/her own business, like sitting behind a glass window watching people passing by... maybe it's a feeling of a visitor on earth, don't want to be tangled w/ reality, always want to be immune and isolated.. hmm.. now to think of this, this actually isn't itself good at all, and probably even can be called bogus, as if I could stay above this world... but really, it's a, tendency, I guess, to not be bounded by some gravity, free spirit? I don't know. It's just part of me since young, and over all these years, I have been lucky to have jobs that allow me such flexibility, or to be more accurate, I allowed myself such freedom whether the boss liked it or not, I couldn't help it. It's like an urge of hunger inside me, and my mind asked to not be caged inside, anything. Back to the film. I wonder why looking at a giant portrait can be so, touching? I think, it's because a person, as wonderful and complex as s/he be, is so insignificant and worthless, that they are like sand on a beach, nobody counts them, nobody tells much of a difference, and nobody pays attention when they step on them, and when a wave comes and goes, they are brushed aside, flushed here and there, some went to the bottom of sea, some moved thousand miles away from \"home\", some never saw the light of day... so this is a life of a sand, a person. But when his/her portrait is taken, is looked at, it's a statement, a manifesto, of the existence of a complex being, right there, a claim that \"I'm here. I have been here.\" It's a voice, silent may it be, but loud and distinct. Each face is an aggregation of all its entirety of his/her past up to the moment, all the joy, sorrow, plain, unique.. if shells of sea are beautiful because they are always different and intricate, here we are, human faces, in the same spirit of these shells, all different, all intricate, and all strangely difficult yet pleasant too be looked at. I don't know. I think the warm feeling of a portrait isn't because of the subject, perhaps, but really, the act of someone who paid attention to the person, took his/her photo, and that, is what warms my heart.. so somewhere, somehow, someone, was finding a life interesting, finding a person worth a shot, finding a moment worth saving, and that, is what really touches us. So in the end, it's the feeling of isolation, of loneliness, that makes us, in the end, human.","tags":"thoughts","url":"https://fengxia41103.github.io/myblog/faces.html"},{"title":"Chauvinism","text":"The first impression of this picture is how many females reporters are there, and how young they all are. If media/communication/opinion are so influential, isn't this then an argument that females are actually controlling our ears!? Of course not! I'm rather questioning, why so many of them are girls? Do they write their columns based on the info they collected here? or just administrative task of taking pictures, compiling bits, and let male reporters back in the office to formulate an opinion? If so, how wrong this actually is already! I have heard this word when young, but never understood what it is, nor ever cared to find out. But recently I have been thinking a lot about feminism, or be more specific, what is a woman? This is probably triggered by watching the Couple Therapy , which prompted me wrote the why read books , not only I think relationship is hard, but I start to realize how little I know about a woman. I remember a Youtube video in which it started filming young girl and boy first, asking them to use movement/gesture to illustrate what is a run, a punch, that sort, then, moved on to an older age group, same pair of a boy and a girl, same or similar asks, then next age group, and so on... the video was striking, and the point it was trying to make clear, that gender image, or so called gender differences that are used to define, or to depict the gender's characteristics, such as weak, gentle, calm, soft, and so on, are really an educational phenomenon → in its natural form, boys, girls, males, females, are the same, I mean, same in sense that they are physically and mentally the same animal. The often quoted argument that females are generally shorter, smaller, weaker physically, are no more than we also see them in any living species, that some individuals or group of individuals present a larger frame, taller, and so on... it's almost laughable in this sense that one would look down someone else because he has a thicker nostril while the other one doesn't! .... the natural response you would have if someone approached you for this cause would simply be, 你有病吧 ... hahaha.. But then, Chauvinism , in particular, the male chauvinism, is everywhere. I didn't realize such a thing even though I have heard earful of so called feminism, women's right, sexual equality, and on and on and on.. To me, they have been nothing but a bucket of words/labels that some people are taking interested in, fighting for it, thinking it's the most important thing on earth, but I have no idea, and doesn't affect my life a bit, so why should I care? But now, I can't help confessing, how wrong was I! After divorce and moved out, I haven't really reflected much about relationship — it's a failure in my case, so nothing to be reflect about but admit the defeat and move on. But once a while, I think maybe it's my engineering curiosity kicks in, that I wonder, why, what did I miss, why the code crashed, and why it crashed in such a way ← if it's a bug, whether it's a bug in me, in her, or in the interaction of ours, or something else, I have an interest to know. It's not about learning the lesson so not to repeat it, but I started to realize that it's inevitable to have social interaction, and being half the population more or less, female represent a group I can't shun from, regardless how I wish. Further, the more I observe this life, this world, and in particular, observing Noah's growing up, I can't help realizing how biased we have been teaching the boys about girls, about this whole gender identity, this image ← whenever I was preaching Noah about being strong, independent, considerate, responsible, I can't help wondering on the back of my mind that this is the same bias I'm putting into him which had infested me so to cause such a, misunderstanding, about woman, which of course led to the failure of the marriage and all that. So, am I then teaching him something that will cause his misery as well!? That will be totally, bad. So, what is woman!? First of all, I have admit, they are beautiful to look at. Yes, there are many many of them, and many of them are simply beautiful — they are lively, energetic, smart, graceful, strong, healthy, having all the qualities I respect and like. Then, this sexual desire. Yes it's of course a nature's call. But then, why the breast, or the feet, or the legs, or the hair, or whatever catches your fancy!? why? Think about breast for a moment. This seems so natural that I'm attracted to one, but then, why so? It's not some childhood psycho deficiency that since infants found peace in them, thus this trait carries into adulthood. Maybe. But really, there is more to this. Move this admiration to a man, has anyone bragged about his 喉结 Adam's apple, \"Look at that guy's adam's apple! How sexy that is!\"... that is just, bizarre, right!? But then, breast is nothing but an effect of sexual development, a trait that females have, just like guys have this. So, why man stared at her breast as if it's the ultimate desire, where his own feature in the same category bears none of this emotion!? I think it's a cliche that sexual feature is always defined in scope of a culture — as the urban legend that Tang dynasty likes plum girls, and some tribes use tattoos here and there, and so on and so forth. As I have said before, if you look at a group of monkeys, you know what, one monkey is deadly attractive because of her beauty, yet, to you/me, I feel, nothing! So, same here. It's really a man-made message that we are propagating from one generation to the next, being part of the heritage/culture, that such image of a gender is formed, then is used as a mold to require/form women to follow. In history if China had misfortune of 贞洁牌坊， then now I can see the same mold is in every culture, different name, but same stuff. So to Chauvinism, this male chauvinism. In recent years while working in China, I have witnessed, heard, debated, and tried to stand up in my capacity against male debasing a female without realizing this could be a two-way conversation. Not only it was shocking to hear someone as intelligent and well doing as a young manager in his 30s bragged about his mom supporting his fight w/ his wife by saying \"I'll find a better wife for you.\", but it was almost sad when we were cleaning up racks of clothes, and the HR girl, whom I thought was as independent and strong as any I know, deliberately didn't want to hire woman because they will have maternity leave. I mean, I am not criticizing them here. I'm thinking of them in this article because it was an experience I wasn't prepared for, and when I heard their sayings and reasoning, I was surprised, surprised that both sex displayed the same trait, the same bias, and were propelling the same static culture/image of woman. Myself has plenty of this bias. I wouldn't excuse myself that \"my father told me so\".. part of it, yes, but also, by myself, I have long been feeling that women are beautiful, and their job in life should be, just that. By having such a view ingrained, I constantly would find it, what will be the word, annoying? intimidating?, when the one I started to know well displayed as strong a mind, as strong an opinion, as strong a stand of a decision, as I would have done myself! So yes, I believe what I had experience is just that, the male chauvinism. Why would I be surprised, or annoyed, or intimidated? The only explanation would be, that I myself had not thought of them in par as myself, I had undervalued their capability, capacity, and was still in position of looking down from a higher position, mentally. How pathetic was I! But how to change this? How to change, myself? I don't know. I feel I know nothing about woman. Maybe it's too late of a time in life to gain that knowledge. But this should be a warning to everyone, that bias, this gender bias, is not only not dead, it is actually quite popular and strong. It's everywhere. But it needs to be challenged. I don't understand, nor support, any of this female equality thing currently going on here. But I do admit that there is something not reasonable, something in which male played a dominant voice and coined a mold for the females without asking of their opinions. And this one-sided initiative is the one I'm becoming aware of, and I think it is wrong.","tags":"thoughts","url":"https://fengxia41103.github.io/myblog/chauvinism.html"},{"title":"Independent Documentaries","text":"Out of nowhere, I ended up watching three Chinese independent documentaries. I don't know why. Started the first one only because I was a bit tired of reading books today and wanted for a change. Then, one , two , three ... I don't know what to think. The strange feeling is that, I was initially touched, or disturbed, but towards the end, I was a bit, calm? numb? No, don't get me wrong. I think all three are excellent movies. I like the reality feeling of them, real people, real environment, real life. I felt the stress, the struggle, the yearn to live and to prosper, the familiar yet foreign settings of Beijing, of the peripheral vicinity of the city that was as rural and dirty and chaotic as I could understand, could picture myself setting foot on, and have ever been. I don't know what to make out of them. I understand all the words, but they all are stories of another planet, another life, that has no similarity to mine, but I don't feel pushed away. Watching their houses, the young kids at Noah's age, their parents of my age, what they do, what they eat, how they feel, keeps me make me think of the four levels in the Factfulness . Where am I? and where are they? I know mine is level 4 according to the book, and probably an above average of level 4. Is theirs level 3? 2? Is such one level of difference so, alien!? I don't know, but what got me to write right now is a feeling that, theirs, are not that different from mine. Not anymore. It used to be that I feel I'm living in parallel universe from theirs. Not only I have no chance to taste their life, I have no desire to do that, either. Over all my life I had thought myself being so higher above their life in every aspect that I didn't even feel there is any necessity to recognize their existence. Yet, now at this age, not that my life is miserable, well, yet it is, in its own way, but I don't feel ours are miles apart anymore. Yes they are still quite different, but no, they are quite the same life, the same agony, same stress, same hope, same how to make a living, same how to feed the kids, same how to make some money and get a better life, and same trying to be recognized by peers, within a circle, grouped w/ friends and family, admitted by like minds, and sneaked small funs here and there so the life is colorful, and even cheerful.... The book by Ji Xianlin, Cowshed , gave me the same feeling today. Such a remote experience, the Cultural Revolution, the Cowshed, Beijing... I knew little of all these. Yet, his stories, whether fictional or not, echoed.. no it's not because I wanted to connect w/ the author. I have no feeling of him one way or another. Except his name I know nothing of his work, nor his reputation. His name is well known, but I don't even know why so. Yet, walking w/ him through his journey of those years, he called his heart a mirror of the time, and each episode of his struggle days, he summarized an image reflected by his mirror , and that particular analogy, I can't agree more. Yes. In the last few months I started to feel more and more aware of what my mind is going through in an experience. Starting w/ that stock tool, I recognized exactly why I took a fancy of this question, what I tried, what were the hurdles, and how I felt.. these, footsteps of the mind, of the heart, became ever more standing out, than before. Why!? Aging? that my mind is slowing down, thus allowing me to catch a glimpse of it now, when it used to race like a rocket? That wouldn't be good. But I would rather think it is because I started to be more sensitive and clear-minded to such things now. Like a kid who would be so absorbed by a butterfly that all the rest of the world could have just disappeared without him know. I used to be a kid's mind. But now, I'm a grown up... how funny, and how sad, at age 48, I'm finally a grown up!? These people in the films, even out of their heavy accents I could feel it, that I know what's going through him mind, and the same thought, same reasoning, have been in mine, also. Even more than this, his reasoning is loud, clear, practical, and a good one.. really, I couldn't do any better than he has done if I were in his shoes. Period. These people, these, used to be nearly illiterate in my mind, have performed extraordinarily well, in this same exam we are in, called, living a life. I can't say I admire them. No I don't. I still know well that many thing I know how to, they don't. But this same statement is now mutual — many things they do w/ ease, I don't know where to start. I don't feel they could ever be as good an engineer as I am if were given a chance. But I highly doubt myself being as good as they are, either, if given the swap. I think in the end of day, the root cause of my feeling is a loss of self-confidence. Perhaps. Bravery. Courage. I used to think I have plenty of them. I have stood up to things I didn't like. I have stood up for strangers to protect them. I have stood up to friends for her causes. But with aging, watching yourself become weaker, uglier, less attractive, less competitive, less polished, less, everything, takes courage, calls for bravery, and a lot, a lot of them. I start to understand mom's choice of insisting living alone. I start to admire her courage of watching herself and dad going into not just age, but loss. Yes, she is a hero, indeed, even though I still hold a grudge against her, I think she is one brave soul, and I could only wish I would have her endurance and strength, to face the deterioration, to face the sunset of a life, to face the inevitable of being lonely, being forgotten, being miserable, being ill, being in pain, being pushed around, but still stand up straight, and be alright. That's what these films have, bravery, courage, a fire to live and to prosper, an energy, that I admire. Bravo for these film makers! I'll try.","tags":"thoughts","url":"https://fengxia41103.github.io/myblog/independent%20documentaries.html"},{"title":"Why read books","text":"\"If you only read the books that everyone else is reading, you can only think what everyone else is thinking.\" - (via dryyoureyes-startbelieving) (via katetbk) On my way out this morning to jog, I suddenly realized why I started to read more and more books. The backdrop is that I have been watching this prime video called Couple Therapy . It's a reality show that four couples showing up in a psychiatrist's office, talked about their relationships, struggles, feelings, and all that. Boy, isn't being together hard!? Yes it is! And this exact conclusion was going through my mind, not only while I was watching the show, but when this morning I was going downstairs to jog. Suddenly I started to realize why I'm reading more and more books these years. The common cliche, of course, are two. First, you start to be interested in, say, history, and with aging, you have more life experience, thus can understand better the complexity of historical event → more interesting now to read them, and to appreciate the intricacy of the time, the characters. Second, you have a stronger urge than when you were younger to have something, knowledge in this particular discussion, to impress your audience. You can label it vanity, middle age crisis, insecurity, and the like. But my question is, why? Why so? I think there are underline currents that actually is driving the two. The first one is easy to understand because it's much to the fact — you do gain more experience, whether you like it or not, that you can relate what happened back then more and more to what you had experienced, thus you often even in the shoe of the character in the story, and you would inevitably form an opinion based on what you would have done, have thought, have felt, if you were there, were him/her, and all these brought the story closer to you, almost making them personal. When you were young, you might have an imagination of being so-and-so while reading a book, or watching a movie. However, regardless how you have identified w/ your hero, all heroes are more or less the same to you as a kid, because they are all external ← your admiration, or willingness to become them, is not based on how much you two were alike. On the contrary, it was based on the exact the opposite — what they have, you don't have them, be it a super power, a way to fly, or the cool gesture. Once you aged, this round of being close to the character again is different. Instead of being rooted in the difference, it is now founded on overlaps — empathy. You feel the pain, feel the panic, feel the hopeless agony, and all these speak an underline theme which, like a ghost, has been hovering over your head all along, you fear it, but don't know what to do w/ it — all these in the book isn't far from you . They are pretty real, to the point that you can picture yourself going through them, not because of an imagination, but because of the slow progress mankind has been making.. oh boy, isn't it too slow sometimes!? Reading Dicken's may sound really remote to us living in Chapel Hill these days, the child labor, the mills, Oliver Twist, orphanage, but here it is, in the headline news, you see it happening right in front of your eyes, somewhere on this planet, there is an Oliver Twist, living the exact poor condition, going through the exact same life journey, and many times theirs are even worse than the book. This makes history not an external fantasy anymore, but another version of the reality — we can call Oliver the British version of the same child labor abuse, while the news of those poor country or the ones trying to escape to America across the border, the Mexican version, and all these versions, have the same story line. And that, makes the click. Regarding the second point, I used to think it's more driven by vanity, you know, the eagerness to brag in front of your friends and dinner table guests. But then, putting aside the possibility that there are people who are just vain, born to be a bragger, it still leaves the question of why many, when they are getting older, are motivated to read? I admit there is a voice on the back of my mind when I read a book, that I could picture speaking certain lines to achieve some admiration stares. But that alone isn't enough to explain the drive. If being able to repeat author's opinion as if it were mine is the primary goal, well, unless you have a good memory, the only alternative would be to study and take notes, treating these books/lines as that English word you were to repeat thousands of times in high school. But I'm not doing that. So out of all the books I read, less than 10%, well, I would dare to say, less than 1%, left any impression on my mind — I couldn't recall what the author said, what the arguments were, any particular line I could quote, or even where it is on my bookshelf! The all likely destiny of them is that I only remember I read them, and with a high probability I never finished them! Sad, isn't it? So, doesn't this then make my reading these books a vain exercise? I think it does based on these, symptoms. But, I think there are more. First, loneliness. I keenly feel the older you are, the lonelier one becomes. Not only you have less and less time to social, but you are more and more living in a setting that are segregated from others. For a large chunk of your younger years, you are immersed in a group environment, schools, clubs, and on. All these, on the one hand, downplayed your individual identity, as you being always identified as part of a team of some sort, thus the team's identity is the super set of yours. On the other hand, it forces social interactions which is the necessary starting point of making friends, knowing somebody, meeting someone, and falling love. Therefore, it felts quite natural and effortless back then that you were hardly alone. But that is not the case once you grow up. Once you step out of school, you start to gain more on the individual level, but lose on the group end. Your family, your house, your this, your that... all of these, are identifying, and emphasizing, you, as an individual, and is separating you from a group. So back to the book topic. We all know reading a book is like conversing w/ the author. Here it is. When you don't have someone to speak to, but the social necessity still exists, reading book is a replacement to socialization ! Therefore, these books are like, a pet, or prostitute, that they come to you whenever at your will, and will go away whenever you dismiss them, no responsibility on your end to make them happy, but they server you 100% wholeheartedly! What a selfish picture I am painting! But that's exact so, isn't it? So I guess at the end of day, a person is selfish, and that trait must manifest somehow. If it were not manifested as a nasty boss, or a criminal, then it will manifest itself in a cloak of reading a book, as if civilized, high cultural, and respectful, but is really the same deal. Now switching gear to another point. I think the older one is, the keener one realizes too many things in life are out of his/her control. When little, we thought parents are our backbones, and their house would stand behind us forever, then untill one day you realize they have grown old and weak, and their house needs your repair, instead of being your invincible castle. Then, marriage, this couple therapy, is revealing that an intimate relationship grown out of intense love may not be robust, either, and they often collapse in the end. So all these would make you realize the only thing you could rely on is yourself. Thus, reading a book, giving yourself knowledge, or new sensation, or whatever, as long as the object is yourself, is more reliable than putting yourself out there hoping to be supported by someone else. So even reading book is always linked to educational value, the true comfort isn't the value of knowledge, but a realization that you are on your own. This, of course, is tied to the previous point of loneliness. This is the 2nd face of the same coin, if you will — I'm lonely, I feel no support by others, thus, I fall back on myself, and reading book is my method. So, books, as long as a human is going through the life journey as I have described above, are really a loyal companion, a safety net, that save you from falling apart completely. It's not a tool to improve yourself, well, it may be the outcome, but rather unintentionally, but a life boat saving you from drowning by the life's misery.","tags":"thoughts","url":"https://fengxia41103.github.io/myblog/why%20read%20books.html"},{"title":"Asian Hate","text":"This, is a genie in a bottle — the entire hatred now felt by the society and occupying the headline news and congress's attention. The world paid dearly for putting it back, putting aside the actual justice each side claimed to be. Yet, Trump disturbed the hornet's nest, and viola, now it's out again. This is really sad, sad times. I need to read Dickens' Hard Times , maybe I'll learn a thing or two in this parallel. Noah's spring vacation. It's super peaceful and quiet when he is not around, that I don't need to get up early to cook and be on the clock, like gears being twisted and turned and driven by some other larger gears. Weather is nice, and my new guitar string worked out wonderfully. That, makes me really happy. I firmly believe that the human language, being as it is, is, if not the root cause of all these hatred and evil, is definitely an accomplice. I think the thought of discrimination is built-in, more native than language, because, after all, language is something you learn w/ an effort, is a skill you acquire after you are born. But the whole tendency of not wanting others to board the bus once you are on, you are born with it, coming from as core as a DNA. Called it whatever it is, selfishness, limitation, discrimination, unfairness... whatever, really, see, this is exactly the problem I'm saying, that the human language, at least the ones I know of (which are only two, but representative at least, English being spoken by 70% of the earth population), that you can't really come up a, term , to describe this, thing, that you want to describe! This is crazy, isn't it? In my line of work, I have been constantly struggling with vague definitions, terms which I call buzz words . But with growing old and having more thoughts to this, what I would call, annoyance, I start to realize this is everywhere, literally, everywhere. This is not beyond being annoyance anymore. This is pure disaster because it feels like a Truman's world, that you live inside it without having a way to get out, and many others you live with don't even realize this problem ← they genuinely believe the blue sky they see is real, as that they firmly believe the buzz word they are using has a definition. No, they are not! They are abstract, general, and could be anything and nothing. They, in the end, don't define themselves, but at the mercy of its interpreter. But we treat them as if they have a soul, are independent, objective, stand on its own. It is this illusion which makes this entire hatred wave terrible. I have long been criticizing the term, the people , which you find prolific among politician addresses. I would much prefer that they were more specific in their talks, don't tell me what you will do for the people, but tell me what you are going to do to solve my problem, say, to fix my porch screen. But I understand as a mayor, a president, they inevitably have to use a general term, thus the people seems convenient and, correct. But, if top down has no choice but to be abstract and vague, I'm totally alarmed by the people who are talking and addressing from bottom up are also using the same language, same concept ← avoiding details, but elevating their agenda and message using the word such as fight for Asian, fight for the Black people, or unite the Minority, that kind of thing. I mean, just take a step back, Asia, is a continent, there are a lot of people living their, they are all categorized as Asian. However, I know for sure Korean don't put them in the same camp w/ Chinese, Japanese don't agree w/ remarks if they were for China, North Korean probably don't agree with any of the Asian population, and Malay? Indosian? Indian? Thai?.... the list can go on and on and on and on... so my point is, there isn't an Asian ! There isn't such a thing as Asian. There is a group identity that billions share. Therefore, speaking of Asian hate and Asian protection are, in my opinion, equally false. You can attack an individual who fits your profile of an Asian (hair, skin color, glasses), but fundamentally you simply don't know. Therefore, such an attack, or hate, isn't even targeting Asian — it's just hate, a feeling that could turn on anyone, anything, without being bothered whether the victim is Asian or not. In other words, what Trump released isn't a prejudice against Asian, but hate and anger that have kept put in this society. Asian is the new victim, just as Jews were the old ones. Do this, swapping the word \"Asian\" out, and replacing it with any other noun you can think of, it doesn't make it right, either, and it doesn't change the nature of such act at all. Therefore, it is this uprising violence we condemn, and no one is immune once violence becomes acceptable. The whole capital riot trial was disappointing to me, because it was so determined by a political view, but lost the view of condemning violence. If a violence at such a scale could be pardoned, well, what else can not be!? Arguing about who is right or wrong using motivation as defense is pointless. I have to agree w/ Russel that \"Fear is the parent of cruelty\" . Yes, violence, hate, attack, are all faces of the same evil, fear. It is fear that now circulating in this air.","tags":"thoughts","url":"https://fengxia41103.github.io/myblog/asian%20hate.html"},{"title":"Stock Trend Analysis","text":"Continue from last article . That one focused on value assessment. This will go over trend analysis. Select a period & price Select a time range for trend analysis Unlike other websites where you usually have choice of 1d, 5d, 1m, 3m, and 6m as time range, this tool can select any date-to-date as you wish, and all following analysis will be done over this selected range. Daily return % Daily return is defined as (close-open)/close of that day. This value is pre-computed as a strategy value. Example of daily return Overnight return % Overnight return is defined as (today's open - yesterday's close)/yesterday's close . This is also a pre-computed strategy value. Example of overnight return I noticed that there is always some after market news or earning calls that will sway the market. Further, apparently trading is going on after the market is closed to me! Therefore, there is a dark period when the price is moving, but I can not participate until the next morning. Using this value together with daily return, I'm hoping to gain sense how likely an up seen overnight will translate to an up during day. My indicators This is really what got me to begin with — the analysis edge I was hoping to achieve. I think this is the same drive that you have in mind. If so, read on. Example of my indicators end-to-end return % : if I buy at the first open price, and hold it till the last close price, how much do you gain? I also call this range return . One can easily picture that any buy-sell pair can be viewed as a range return. Of course, in reality, buying at open price and sell at close price is not possible, at least not for me. So whatever the return is, it's an ideal situation. compounded return % : this is to emulate a busy day trader who, instead of holding through the range, buy at each open and sell at each close , thus riding the daily wave. Since there are ups and downs, what is the compounded return then? In most cases I looked at, compounded return is always < range return. Therefore, riding wave is not a good idea, even when transaction fee is 0. close price RSD % : RSD, relative standard deviation, is to measure how much swing close price is seen in this time period. The larger the value, the more volatile it appeared. One catch, however, is that when computed over a longer time period, because prices is ever going up, for example, this value will naturally become larger. Therefore, it's more useful if you compare stock A vs. B over the same period, not to a single stock itself. overnight flip/consistency : I'm curious how likely an overnight trend carries over to the next day 1 . Numbers are day count. overnight flip returns up %/down % : This is one step further on observing an overnight trend against its next day. In a flip, there could be a large up, then a small down, and vice versa. Therefore, by computing the compounded return of overnight and today, we can see how many flips resulted in a positive return. Up and down % adds up to 100%. In the example above, among overnight flips, 46% would have resulted in a positive return, but 56% in the negative. Therefore, in this case down flips were not compensated enough by the next day ups, meaning the sentiment, though flipped a bit, was still carrying the day. two-day trend up/down/flip : Taking two consecutive days, how many are both ups, downs, or reversed. Since human is naturally looking at yesterday's trend feeling it will be duplicated today 2 , knowing how likely today's positive will flip is at least a useful probability measure. daily return up %/down % : Easy. Take each day's return, what's the odds you would have made money if riding that day? In the example above, 50/50, indeed a random walk down the Wall Street. nightly return up %/down % : Counting overnight returns, how likely it would have gone up or down. Using this probability, one may bet the overnight. One reason is that overnight is off limit to investor. We simply don't have access or control over this period, but the market doesn't sleep. Further, I noticed that some companies make earning calls deliberately after market is closed. Therefore, this is really a period of uncertainty by design of the system. up daily return avg/RSD % : Curious how much a daily up we saw in term of average and its RSD. Taking this together w/ down daily return avg/RSD % , I'm hoping to shed light whether upside is better than the downside. In the example, upside avg was 1.91% while downside was 2.11%. Therefore, downside dominated, in average. Up's RSD was less than down's, so that we saw larger scale of swing when there was a down day than one of an up day. So overall, I would take this period as a down period and would expect to lose since the odds were not in up's favor. Tech indicators I didn't invent any of these. Found this react library , and am using it to plot these fancies. One downside of this approach is that I don't have computed numbers such as SMAs. So later I might re-implement these values so to make more sense of them. One observation is that all of them are doing some kind of SMA, which is essentially a smoothing technique. I have commented in previous article that this is a double edge sword as it can generate so called a pattern for pattern's sake. Further, these charts are clearly against philosophy that stock history is not a reliable indicator of the future . Therefore, I have them here because of their popularity mostly. Bollinger Band Read the wiki . It's interesting. Example of Bollinger Band Elder Ray See intro . Example of Elder Ray SAR See wiki . Example of SAR Full Stochastics Oscillator See wiki . Example of Full Stochastics oscillator Heikin-Ashi Read here . Example of Heikin Ashi MACD See wiki . Example of MACD Relative Strength (RSI) See intro . Example of RSI In theory, you can profit off any probability that is greater than 50. Therefore, if there is a discrepancy between consistency and flip, you should be able to bet the next day using this probability. This same thought goes to other flip/consistency measures. ↩ Even though it is a cliche that history does not predict the future, in stock's case, it is difficult for layman investor such as myself to think otherwise. Yesterday's trend is the closest information we have got. ↩","tags":"stock","url":"https://fengxia41103.github.io/myblog/stock%20trend%20analysis.html"},{"title":"Valuation of a Stock","text":"Detail of a stock is the primary research tool where you get one-stop-shop of its numbers. Instead of duplicating common layouts such as Google Finance, Finviz, I'm hoping to provide a better user experience that focuses on how a reader of this page is to consume the information, not just throwing at him pile of facts & data, which, though always impressive to begin with, is often overwhelming and creating a diminishing return of these information quickly. Select a stock To look at detail of a stock, select a symbol of list: Stock list Upon typing on the search bar, case-sensitive matching takes place automatically with a 1-second debounce. Matched one will then be highlighted. To return to the full list, simply clear the search bar. Stock list filtered Summary Stock detail summary section Three values that are less intuitive than others are: DuPont ROE : ROE computed using the Dupont model. This is based on company's financial statements. If happened to be that this stock doesn't have statement data, value will be 0, equivalent to an invalid. ROE Gap % : Since there is also published ROE, this value indicates how far off the Dupont ROE from published one: % = (published-dupont)/published 1 . Negative value will indicate that consensus opinion is more conservative on this stock than I am. Top 10 Institution Owned % : Counting the ownership of top 10 largest institutional owner/investor in this stock. Dupont ROE Dupont model is a decomposition of ROE. There are three major financial metrics that drive return on equity (ROE): operating efficiency, asset use efficiency and financial leverage. Operating efficiency is represented by net profit margin or net income divided by total sales or revenue. Asset use efficiency is measured by the asset turnover ratio. Leverage is measured by the equity multiplier, which is equal to average assets divided by average equity. What I like about this is the distinction of three different business models: high margin : reflected in high profit margin. Their unit profit is good, think of high-end fashion. Downside of this type is that increasing volume will work against high unit margin. Thus scaling up by producing more is not the right strategy. high turn over : think of Walmart, low unit margin, but huge volume. This is the opposite of high margin model, and is the dominant strategy by nearly all new entrants of an industry ← selling things cheap is always a eyeball catcher. high leverage : don't know yet how to read this value because it feels a double-edge sword — can be interpreted as having the good credit to borrow (assuming banks are not stupid), or, on the other hand, loaded w/ debt and is in trouble. Further, this is highly dependent on the macro when debt is cheap or expansive, and I would even say the personality of CFO, as we all know, gamblers stack high leverage, and conservative grandpa hates debt. A common example of this model is the financial industry, whose foundation is leverage. ROE, or the published ROE you find online, is usually based on an averaged sales over multiple reporting periods, averaged assets, and so on, thus resulting a single number. This tool, however, computes ROE for each reporting period, thus shedding lights on how ROE has changed over time 2 . Example of Dupont Period-to-Period Chart is normalized so to see its change easily. In this example above, MSFT's ROE runs around 30 year to year. Profit margin and asset turnover all went up in 2020 report, indicating a healthy business operation. Its equity multiplier dropped a bit, indicating it is taking on more debt than before. Considering MSFT's reputation, I wouldn't then worry about its increased debt, and further considering the cheap interest rate, it's likely a good strategy to leverage up in this period. For example, if you google msft bond rate , MSFT is running at 3.625% , making borrowing money quite cheap for MSFT. Net Asset per Share Net asset valuation is often applied to company that will be liquidated. Here I'm applying a simple version: (total asset - total liabilities)/shares . The idea is that if I pay off all liabilities, what's left for stockholder, assuming you get asset for its book value. Of course, this is a very rough estimation. Example of Net Asset per Share However, there is also an important underline assumption that asset will grow together with business ← essentially the company is becoming bigger and bigger, and that biggness is in term of its assets. Therefore, if it is deemed a healthy business, growing net assets per share should be an indicator of its success. Using the example above, BFAM's NAV grew from $12 to $21. Considering it is acquiring more daycare centers and probably equipment with them, I am taking this trend as a healthy growth of the business. DCF Yeah I did quite some DCFs back in the MBA days, and sadly, I almost forgot how to do it. So here it is, bringing back some memories. Example of DCF DCF has a lot of assumptions . So I really don't see how to verify or beat the market on all these dials single-handedly. Play with your scenario by tweaking the input fields see how it will affect the valuation 3 . Note that terminal rate has a dramatic impact on the valuation. So be prudent in your projection. Also, if your target is an ETF, there won't be a DCF because it doesn't have balance sheet. Balance Sheet Balance sheet data are the largest data set. See yahooquery doc for available data points. I found raw numbers on a balance sheet are rather pointless because human brain isn't good at processing them. Further, knowing one's asset is 2.3B is meaningless, but its changing from 2.3B to 2300B in one period is revealing! Therefore, for balance sheet analysis, I'm not listing any reported numbers, but are focusing on % of a total, and the same index change % from one period to next. Example of balance sheet I want to be conservative. Therefore, more attention is given to debt and liability. equity multiplier : = asset / equity . Since asset=debt+equity , the higher this multiplier is, the more debt this company is taking, thus more leveraged. This, of course, is a double edged sword. It can mean that it has capability to raise debt (w/ lenders), thus using less equity to do business; it an also mean it's loaded w/ debt and is in trouble. debt to equity ratio : = total debt/equity . Similar to the equity multiplier, I'm trying to understand how bad the company is relying on debt. So, if debt is 60%, and equity is 40%, it will be 6:4=1.5. Therefore, the higher this number is, the more leveraged this company is. liability/asset % : = total liability/total assets . I'm assuming if the company is liquidating, will its asset enough to pay off its liability 4 . Without consideration of discount, relative change among periods are still valid. period-to-period changes debt % of asset : = total debt / total assets . Debt is long-term liability. Ideally you also need to discount liability for its market value, not using its book value. In the example above, about 50% of assets are debts. Debts are often renewed so a company constantly borrows. So my understanding is that a stable % is fine; a sudden change will signal health issue or a strategy shift. debt % : = growth of total debt from p1 to p1. Value of the first reporting period will be set to 0 as it has no previous one. Similar to the debt % of asset above, it measures how quickly a company is accruing debts. Negative value will be highlighted because the debt is decreasing, a good sign. account payable % : = growth of AP . AP is a liability. I feel in business AP can grow for two reasons: company is not paying off vendors because it's poor, or being greedy to use AP as free deposit for interest. AP decrease may either be a healthy sign that company has money to pay, or that vendors are losing faith in this business. account receivable % : = growth of AC . The counterpart of AP. If it grows, it's a bad sign that customers are not paying. cash % : = growth of cash, cash equivalents, and short-term investment . In other words, anything one an quickly turn into cash are counted. If it grows, I take it as a positive sign. working capital % : as name. Working capital = current assets - current liabilities. In other words, this measures how much a company needs to keep its business going, like a filler. If it grows, then the gap is enlarging, which puts more burden in borrowing to get a bigger filler. net PP&E % : as name. PP&E is a long-term investment. It's a signal how much they are investing into the future production. Think about this. If you are going to run away, will u want to invest into a factory, or keep cash? So, I think a positive change is a good thing. Income Statement See yahooquery doc for available data points. Again, raw numbers are not helpful. Instead, % of a total is useful, eg. profit margin. Example of income statement COGS margin % : = cogs/revenue . Total cost to bring in that much revenue. I'm expecting it to be rather stable if a business is run well. operating income margin % : = operating income/operating revenue . The higher it is, the higher operating margin there are, thus more efficient. operating expanse margin % : = operating expanse/operating revenue . These are direct cost to earn those revenue. The lower, the better. However, if we look at operating income margin together with this, you will find their sum is not 100%! What is missing is the operation overhead. OPEX margin % : = OPEX/revenue . EBIT margin % : = EBIT/revenue . total expanse margin : = total expanse/revenue . Cash Flow Statement See yahooquery doc for available data points. In this analysis, all values are converted to B . As a layman, I think the more cash you have, the better. Example of Cash Flow Statement cash growth from beginning : = (ending cash - beginning cash)/beginning . This measures how much cash grew in that reporting period. I take this as a sign of how profitable the business is. operating cash from prev % : how much operating cash grew from previous report. I focus on operating cash because it represents what this business is about. Income, on the other hand, can be generated not through its core business, but some fancy accounting or financial activity (eg. bought bitcoin early) ← these are not what this business is, but luck. So if this index is growing, I take the biz is growing stronger. FCF/operating CF : how much operating cash ended up being free cash. The higher, the less overhead/debt one needs to pay off from operating cash flow, thus healthier. FCF/net income : a good explanation here : If net income is much larger than cash flow from operations, it's a signal that the company's earnings quality-the usefulness of earnings-is questionable. If cash flow from operations exceeds net income, on the other hand, the company may be much healthier than its net income suggests. operating CF/net income : just because. valuation ratios These are published ratios taken from yahooquery . I'm taking them on face value as a reference point. Example of valuation ratios In this example, BFAM's PE grew from 49.76 in 12/31/2019 to now 364.38 on 3/3/2021. Alarming, isn't it!? If accepting this, we are saying this business grew 7x more valuable in just one year, 2020, and don't forget 2020 was the Corvid year! Doesn't make sense, does it? On the other hand, P/B decreased from 9.73 → 7.76 over the same period. Therefore, we actually need to find out what these book values came from, as it must have grown a lot in 2020. If they are assets useful for operation, it's a good thing; otherwise, remember, liability is part of asset also (since debt can actually be sold, thus has value!). So growing asset can also be that it's taking on more debts, which, in my opinion, is not a good thing. Whenever there is a published alternative to a computed one, it will always cast doubt when the two are different. Comparison as this is an attempt to measure how accurate source data are, and how accurate my computation is. Even assuming these two are perfect, a substantial gap would imply that I'm missing information which the concensus value has included (of course, here I'm assuming the published value is itself dependable). ↩ Smoothing always troubles me because it can mask outliers without good reasoning. An outlier can either be a noise that skews result, or a signal that something is wrong. Overall, I prefer a business who runs rather like a stable ship, not a bumper cart. ↩ I thought of building a sensitivity analysis. However, the general impact of each factor can be understood without using a specific stock. Further, combination of these factors can grow to a large matrix, and presenting all of them may seem impressive, but defeats the purpose making data consumable by a user. ↩ Asset value is using its book value. In reality, this should be discounted as some assets may have no buyer. Further, intangible asset such as reputation should be heavily discounted or removed entirely since I'm really thinking of this in case of the company being troubled, and then its name won't be worth much. ↩","tags":"stock","url":"https://fengxia41103.github.io/myblog/stock%20valuation.html"},{"title":"Stock App Design","text":"Backdrop The app is a complete rewrite of one which I wrote five years ago. At the time Jookun approached me that he had some wise strategies of investment. I was intrigued by his passion, but wanted to verify its worth using some simulation. Thus a Django was created with Yahoo finance daily data as the input, and some data crunch based on his idea. Like all other ideas, I started to come up some of my own while working on it, and gradually it let me deep down into the rabbit hole — for the first time in my career, I had computation so intense that it would overheat my laptop and had it shut down! I felt I was on track of something. However, it had then been left to rot since. Though I had tried to revive it over the years, some of the code was done in such a complex manner that I didn't have the heart to read it again. One impression, however, always left me with a hope, the difficulty of obtain these free daily data. As mentioned, I started with Yahoo data. However, it was shut down just around that time. Later I shifted to Alpha Advantage while it was still free of use. Well, not anymore. Soon after I switched to it, I guess it gained enough popularity that it went on with memberships and so on. What jumping through these hoops occurred to me that if I could just publish these historical data somehow, and let people download and use them, there are already value. So recently, I started to think about this idea. Starting with another round of reviving the old app, I implemented Django command to dump DB data into CSVs, thus creating 500+ files, each representing a SP500 symbol, which were what I had. However, I want more — how about a better user experience? how about some computation of probabilities based on a layman's observation? how about DCF?... all these, eventually propelled me to rewrite this from scratch, and here it is. Audience & goals First, it is an absolute illusion if a beginner like myself will beat the market by these analysis, not only because of limitation of knowledge, information, and experience, but of personality. I don't know what the winners are like. Internet is filled with articles on what it takes to be a good investor. I have some of those qualities, but there is no guarantee nonetheless. Therefore, I'm back to zero. But one thing I am certain, that everyone will experience what I have experienced, at some point of his/her life, that they are curious, or interested in, the stock market, have the itch to try, know some bits of it, but not a whole lot, and have some basic hunch of some pattern , or frequency , or occurance , and thought there might be a gold mine buried underneath and yourself might be the lucky one. So, how to find out, or to verify? Here are five levels of users I sense: Type Tool Audience 1 apps & websites Have basic knowledge, satisfied with reported info 2 Excel Think they have some data/info analysis edge 3 Excel + VBA Automate routine computation and data assembly 4 Script or lib Programmer who gained more computation power over Excel 5 Commercial Professional, sky is the limit, membership Difference between 3 & 4 are blurry, but the idea is that scripting/lib will give you a much wider selection of tools than VBA. Further, VBA is not as good a building block if you want to stand on the shoulder of a giant. Users of type 1 and type 5 are not my audience. User of type 2,3,4 are essentially the same people — they are independent/self-confident enough to think of their own method, but are yet willing to go with a commercial source or solution they have some financial knowledge, and are not afraid of (or even fond of) data crunching. Their routine follows these steps — Obtain raw data: daily price (well, you could also have finer grain data) financial reports: balance sheet, income statement, cash flow computed ratios, eg. P/E, beta some popular indicator or evaluation values Crunch of his own indicator or measure using these data Draw a graph here and there to visualize his results Search for pattern During my research and implementation, following this pattern, I found a few places where this tool can help: Getting data . represented the first barrier higher than expected. I have related my experience w/ Yahoo, Google, Alpha. I'm surprised how limited such data sources are there considering how widely spread the Internet has become, and stock data being always in the public domain. A value of this tool is to handle API of available data sources so to retrieve available raw data. Cleansing data . Once you get data, consuming data represents another barrier — understanding particular data form (← this is usually source dependent) and handling data anomaly. 2nd value of this tool is to normalize these data points, and potentially amending missing data by providing reasonable default. Computing standard ratios . Crunching a clean data set is usually not the challenge at all. Of course you can go with your fancy where the edge is believed to be. However, there are always a few standard ratios everyone seems to begin with, eg. growth rate of a number from period to period, or pcnt of one expanse of the total, things like that. They are not difficult to compute, but rather mechanical/tedious, and are not readily available from a data source 1 . Therefore, you have to do them manually . Therefore, 3rd value of this tool is to provide some computed values out of box. One beauty of historical data is that they don't change. Therefore, a pre-calculated result is as good as new. In short, one can view this tool as a fancy automated Excel template that I have built to facilitate routine works and get you going w/ your analysis quickly less the mechanical build-up that is necessary but distracting from analysis itself. System design Stock app high level design System is split into backend and fronend. Backend is a Django app w/ exposed REST API using Tastypie . Frontend is React . Primary data source is Yahoo's financial data. In particular, I'm pulling these: historical stock daily prices — high, low, open, close, volume financial statements — balance sheet, income statement, and cash flow statement published meta — beta, P/E, and so on. Since these are opinionated, Yahoo is just one of many alternatives. Data model Model names are intuitive. Name Description MyStock Place for name, symbol MyStockHistorical Daily trading data MyStrategyValue Pre-computed values based on historical, eg. moving average IncomeStatement As name BalanceSheet As name CashFlow As name ValuationRatio Published valuation ratios, eg. P/E. They are source dependent. Stock app data models Data persistence & processing Data persistence is MySql 5.7. Using Django's ORM, this is not a hard requirement if your preference is something else. Data processing is handled by Redis via Celery so to achieve ease of scale. As mentioned earlier, MyStrategeValue are derived from historicals, thus are computed prehand using this mechanism: Django custom command → compose celery task → submit task to Redis queue → task executed and data is persisted to DB. There are also custom model property which is computed on the fly. Most of them can be pre-computed also since historicals are not static. However, to minimize dependency on these values that must be prepared as a separate step, I opted to the current method. By observation, performance penalty by not having them in DB is acceptable. Using docker, the following data volumes are used: Volume Attach to stock-data Main DB data storage redis-data Redis data storage Network Network of the setup is fairly simple. We distinguish data vs. management : Stock app networks Ports A service is a function unit. In this implementation, each is a docker. I try to limit exposure of ports on docker host so this application can be easily co-hosted with others without causing port conflicts. In essence, 8084 is the frontend UI port, and 8003 is the backend API port. All others are docker-to-docker only. Component Docker Port Service Host Map Frontend 80 Main frontend app w/ Nginx built-in 8084 Backend 80 Nginx proxy 8003 Backend 3306 MySql DB none Backend 8001 Django app none Backend 6379 Redis none Develop & Deployment Assuming you have docker and docker-compose installed already, clone the repo , and under /backend and /frontend , use the docker-compose up --build for the first run to build initial images, and docker-compose up -d for incremental changes. Frontend development can be benefited by a non-docker setup. So you need to npm install then npm run dev . Once you are satisfied w/ your frontend code, production deployment can be docker-compose up --build -d . Some source provide indicators such as MACD. Most, however, only provide raw/reported data such as sales of an Income Statement. My goal, therefore, is to follow the conventional train of thought by converting these values into percentage, and some period-to-period change rate, and so on, which I found myself doing a lot whenever I receive an Excel full of numbers. ↩","tags":"stock","url":"https://fengxia41103.github.io/myblog/stock%20app%20design.html"},{"title":"Impeachment","text":"I have to say, this is very disappointing. Listening to the calls of these senators to say guilty or not guilty, was very disheartening, when so many say not guilty. This was very puzzling to me. I mean, what would you do when there were somebody pointed a gun at your head? And isn't this capitol hill building like their home? So? We ordinary people were all taught that if someone invaded your private property, you can just fire and shoot. But here, their home was invaded by these mobs, and yet, they played so called politics! I don't understand, really, what is going on !? When I was young, I learned that those so called 世纪审判 by Soviet were all staged. I remember reading them in a book from my college library, and it was quite a shocker to me. I had little life experience then, and nothing of my own opinion on this subject. But over the years I have always believed that such trials won't happen in America. Not that I believe politics are better there. But I have an ultimate faith in the legal system of what America stands for, that a person is assumed innocent until proven guilty, and all accusations are based on evidence, not behind-the-door deal makings. But this, is a slap in the face. I especially couldn't understand Mitch McConnel's speech after he voted not guilty. Why acquitting him then!? And impeaching him doesn't block him from being sued for criminal charges, either, right!? It's irrelevant whether there is a better mean to judge him or punish him, it's your stand that matters here. It's the same that you stand up for a bully at the moment you catch him doing the wrongs — yes there is police and all that who can punish him better. But hey, you should just stand up to the bully at that time, and say, \"stop\"! because that's what a decent citizen, human being, should do! I don't understand this. I think the real damage isn't only this demonstration of cowardice, but now they are sending a confusing message to the public. When a person doesn't behave consistently, everything becomes a crying wolf, and it makes it difficult then to know when there is a real wolf. I thought this was exactly the argument by Hayak in his The Road to Serfdom , that a planning economy distorted the message conveyed by price, thus making people not trusting the market anymore, which then spills over to all aspects of society because, once your inner compass was disturbed, you lose a reference to tell true from false. I think this is exactly what happened yesterday when he was acquitted. This is even more difficult for a dad when I'm raising my son and battling his habit of saying a lie so to get out of a trouble. This is a human nature, the first defense you use when you are caught. And I think the entire education is about curbing this nature, so that you will be honest even when things are not in favor to yourself, you admit your acts, apologize, and try to fix it. That's what I preached to Noah, that's what I thought everyone should be doing, that's what an adult was told to be. These senators are supposed to be an example because they represent ideas, and an idea is what America is all about! So when they fail, they didn't fail as an individual, but failed as an idea, and when America doesn't have the idea anymore, how is it then different from any other country in which people are suffering because of their government or even their dictators! This is just, wrong. I don't know. This is a dark time, really, I think, that is comparable to what I heard of the 1930s when Hitler was rising. Condolence of 1/6 is like condoning invasion of Poland — that was a calculated act that all the Allies thought were a deal. Yet, the world ended up paying millions of lives for this. When a mistake like such was made, no one was going to win.. well, Stalin won, but hey, who is to use his example to justify a deed, any deed? He was the lowest of the lows, wasn't he!? These senators thinking they could still retreat w/ their loots were simply defying history lessons! If you want to be nasty and benefit yourself!? well, what Mr.Kim's family has been doing is actually the correct version — doing the wrong consistently, blatantly, publicly, shamelessly, relentlessly, and thoroughly. So was Hitler. He said what he did, and he never swayed from his idea, no inconsistency whatsoever. I don't like any of these fanatics. But they are at least predictable, and thus stoppable. It's these opportunists, who always put their benefits ahead of any, are, like an elusive bug ← if you can't reproduce them, how do you then analyze them and come up a fix!?","tags":"thoughts","url":"https://fengxia41103.github.io/myblog/impeachment.html"},{"title":"GameStop","text":"This, is absolutely, entertaining! Wow, I have to believe that somewhere out there there is a voice that is directing me to these things, really. I don't watch the market usually, if at all, then, open to read the news yesterday, and it was the frenzy of GameStop and AMC all over the news! Of course there are plenty China readers reaction as well. So, what to make of it!? China posts usually put this as a revolution so that common people uprising against the big capitalist, the Wall Street. Well, it's exciting thinking that way, but it's only what the surface looks like. I don't buy this story, well, I should say, I totally buy what the news said about the Reddit wallstreetbets where this whole thing might have started from. But the implication, imho, is far more than an uprising. So, this is another predict-to-the-future episode. Let me try, maybe I do have a crystal ~~ First of all, learned in MBA class that stock market is pretty small comparing to the bond market. I think it's just a commoner's fallacy that wall street traders all watching the stock market going up and down as we, or the 菜场大妈， do. Far from it, even though I'm just another outside. They don't watch market as we do, and if anything, big decisions are unlikely made on the spot by any human — there is gotta be process, and likely automation. It's a loaded cannon, for God's sake, that it may react quickly if a human commander can just pull the trigger, but hey, days like yesterday's are few in a whole year, but a loaded canon can misfire a LOT if relying on a human. So, regardless how popular the image of these traders are in movies, I firmly believe Wall Street lives off discipline and likely strict automation → I'm not even talking about automation of data crunch, backtesting, big data analysis, AI, those craps. It's codified knowledge, strategy, experience, trial-and-error, policy, protection, the core of what they know and what they do. Therefore, the uprising, if we call it so, isn't really causing some panic traders running around. Rather, it's a puzzling act, I bet, that they start to get notifications of some strategy conditions have been met, but unexpected, like me stepping on a bug, you know, you stare at the screen, and all you will be saying is, \"WTF\", and hardly much you can do even if you know exactly which line of code to change, because the change has to go through a line of processes before it be stamped as production ready . So, I think, is what the Wall Street, was like yesterday. Now, move on to what this episode means in the future? The easiest answer tossed around is that revolution is here, 颤抖吧资本家. Really? In my opinion, no. Capitalist isn't going to shake to death at all. Again, using my bug analogy, it's definitely annoying, but not a killer, even the BSOD isn't bad enough to scare you off your pants, is it!? Just some terrible oversight allowed this to happen, and always always always, a human error, not the machine's. So, we can safely dismiss the idea that now all shorts are going to leave the arena because, hey, who dares to counter so called the people !? But, regardless how they raid, yes, raid, this is exactly like those normads raiding some town back in the days — they brought fear, death, and walk away w/ loots, but at the end of the day, it's hardly a profitable model, let alone sustainable. There are many factors come to play, which I can predict, will collapse this brotherhood high even though it feels so good. No, this isn't some conspiracy theory, but by my observation and thinkings of human behavior in similar settings. First, there will be split of opinion on whom to loot. If not amassing enough force, raid will not work. The first couple raids are easy to pull off because few has too much opinion yet on a new thing — let's try it. Once the POC is done, all of sudden, many more realize this is a feasible path (to make $$), thus each start to chip in their personality and opinion, which then lead down to, not business, but politics. And to my observation, once a loosely organized community start to battle different opinions, it will be strained because of the high tension, and that pushes away many, thus it hurts the community becomes large. The alternative, however, is the party, or the church, like things, that have rules, priests, punishments, and all these things are totally not what people joining such community wanted to have at the first place! So they will find them propelling an org which they themselves dislike, morally. So even making good money, the conscience isn't as wonderful as it feels yesterday — yesterday, it felt they did the right thing , but eventually, it becomes a tradeoff between moral and profit, well, then how different it is then from the Street they hate!? Second, I don't like this mob actions at all. Again, it is super entertaining. But it's scary. Not that they have a guy big enough to blow anybody. Not yet. But they definitely have a gun that hurts. Now the question is, are they a responsible/sane/decent guy owner!? Well, this is a fuzzy question. Whose moral standard we go by with? And even we could challenge, does it matter? If we consider the capitalist has the origin of sin, then it justifies the action, right? Well, then, is the assumption, correct? By the Trump years we can already see the magnified mob voice everywhere, US, China, everywhere! Lies, truth, facts, who-knows-what, are flying all over the place. Internet is a free highway, and a lot of folks are behaving like a highway robbers, too. So, if January we were still debating Trump's tweeter account. Now all of sudden the Netcizens showed that other aspects of life can be as vulnerable as the politics if applying the Internet way. If a platform can sway voters to elect a Trump, then it is certainly perceivable the same method can be applied to a stock, a company, of course, a human being. If we used to consider online bullies are just minorities of some teenager incidents, we now see the same spirit, I should say, sentiment, is now spilling out of that playground, and is now stretching its paws onto something we thought pretty out of reach — well, it apparent is not, anymore. Third, just saw a news that creditors of AMC just got off the hook because now AMC can issue more stocks, raise money, then pay off these creditors. For a losing business, creditors are betting the high interest w/ that company not going to bankrupt. Well, now I bet they start to realize there is another strategy — buy some online power, get the sentiments to support his client, then bail out! Wow, now, these people are very different from the people — they are bankers, they have money, they have incentive, and yesterday, the people just demo-ed a POC! Wow, I think this is the real implication going forward. The big money is now going to come into the Internet shouting game, hire some big mega phone, and arouse some sentiments. This, is not going to be pretty. There is still one more question I don't know the answer yet — again, it's easy to perceive such strategy, but it's hard to pull it off. So, w/ all the strangers on a forum, why and how they can act in union? This, is actually quite amazing. Reminds me the news of 鹿晗 fans organized to get some exact number of blesses, something like exactly 10&#94;8, no more, no less, on his birthday. It does then seem possible this can happen, if not sending a bless, but in yesterday's case, money. Hmm... I like the name, GameStop, yeah, indeed, some old games are being stopped, and new players and new ways are here.","tags":"thoughts","url":"https://fengxia41103.github.io/myblog/gamestop.html"},{"title":"Attention","text":"This is a curious thing. By sort of a pure accident, I haven't been looking at the 朋友圈 for a while. I don't even know how long it has been, weeks? Not a whole month I'm sure. But here is a thought just occurred to me — during this period, there are many of my friends whom I now know nothing about. I mean, I don't what they did, or said, or thought, nothing ← because it used to be that I got their news from the broadcast . Almost like a personal radio station that you need to tune in in order to listen. Well, the flip side is also true — if you want to shut them off, just don't tune in. This makes me wonder why so and what it means!? It used to be that I thought the people 做 when they don't reveal their thoughts but making you to guess. As a matter of fact, this is a common conversation I have w/ Noah these days, that unless he can voice his idea and want, I'm not a mind reader. So this same cliche goes w/ many sad love stories when the two stop communication, usually by the girl first, that the poor guy has to guess what she wants, that's when the relationship went haywire, in my opinion anyway. But now, w/ this 朋友 圈 thing, I wonder whether it is yet another human weakness that everyone, I do mean everyone, is hunger for passive attention . That's right. Instead of asking for attention which we were told and educated to be a bad behavior, yet we want attention, want to be in the spotlight. Thus, we take the approach of actively broadcasting (I call it broadcasting because it, at least, pretends that it's oblivious to audiences, \"Look I'm talking whether there is someone listening or not\"), yet our satisfaction is when the other person tune in by their choice ! So in this sense, we are just playing a victim role that I'm innocent, I don't want to behave badly (eg. asking for attention, in this case), well, since you tuned in, first of all, if there were fault, it's yours; second, I get the recognition, even falsely, that my message must be good! Hmm, interesting. So it's even about attention, now to think of it. It's really about fundamentally two things, which both I found in Noah, therefore it must be a built-in human traits, not unique to anyone, but universally true to everyone — fear to take responsibility, and eager for comradeship. The first point, I feel, is a bit exaggerated. I don't think the word \"responsibility\" is accurate. I mean, by being passive doesn't really mean being irresponsible. Just to think of the alternatives. What? Shovel your ideas down to someone's throat? That's not pleasant either. So it's better to be in the passive mode → waiting for others to discover. But, this reminds a conversation I had w/ my roommate years back, that his idea of life is to announce his virtue in loud speaker, not necessarily to magnify it in a loud speaker, but at least not to bury it in a sand; mine was the burying it in a sand, but hoping the diamond, by being a true diamond, will shine through, maybe taking time, but it will, right? Well, that was 22 years ago. Now at this age, I'm not so sure that a diamond will eventually shine through. I guess I'm still considering myself as a diamond, which may not be justified, but nonetheless, I haven't yet given up hope that this idea of life is worth my time. So back to this broadcasting mode. It isn't that people shun from responsibility by not making a direct message to you. Well, in a way, yes. By not speaking directly, say, face to face, even virtually, it does take away the responsibility of your remarks! But let's not be too strict on this. It's not ideal broadcasting, but it's not a crime, either. But the second point, the comradeship one, isn't it the same as the cliche that 人类是群居动物？ Even if I take this point, what that means? It sounds obvious that we, from the animal phase of human history, huddle together for safety and survival. So such trait continuously dictate our life. Is it so? When I was speaking to Noah on similar things, I used to think that it's about self-confidence, or in adult's term, independent thinking, that you are confident and have a willingness to make a conclusion and judgment of your own regardless the popular sentiments (well, even in this sense, what's the boundary between independent thinking and being just arrogant!? Don't those BS policy makers, such as the recent 返乡 one, pretty independent in this sense that s/he didn't care a whim of what the public's daily life would be like w/ this BS idea!? But we won't value their independent effort, do we?) So, if we can't really draw a clear line between them, wouldn't it be a bad idea to solicit 2nd opinion, in this case, seeking recognition, seeking agreement, seeking nods, from someone else, like-minded, so to confirm that my idea isn't off the track, that it has merits, and it's a good one, just like myself has thought so!? Isn't it nothing but natural!? Or even, necessary!? Don't all dictators all make decisions without listening to others, so that they had full, maybe too full, of an independent thinking, while lacking agreements? Therefore, it feels not a bad idea at all to post 朋友圈， as it's not a mode of 做 at all, but a good strategy to follow, so that you won't become more and more, arrogant and narrow minded. Hmm... But here is another wrinkle to this. When everybody is radioing his/her voice, not only the like-minded will be able to find each other, thus forming so called interest group , but it always implies a one-way communication — as mentioned earlier, it's a one way from them to my ear, I'm broadcasting sth whether you listen or not , and me the audience can turn you off without ever telling or saying why. Therefore, the entire communication in this mode is always, lacking a feedback loop. If so, it means the system is not stable, and it's prone to oscillation leading to spin out of control, in theory! In a face to face talk, the feedback is the other person's face or hand, or the awkward silence in the air, thus speak always means being sensitive to the other's reaction. Now being behind a screen, such social media took away the feedback mechanism, well, it didn't take away the feedback cause you can still see the comments, if you will, but making it irrelevant if you choose not to respond! So it's like making the feedback optional in a control system — and that's the difference, and the danger. A bit detour to this social impact. So back to 朋友圈. What I was really thinking was that who are still my friends? If s/he were my true friend, wouldn't it be that s/he will talk to me, send me a message, directly, instead of waiting for me to monitor your life through this radio? I would think so. I say Hi to my friends when I miss them, I ask them how they are doing, want to connect w/ them. I have things in life I want to share, want to know theirs, too. Mostly importantly, being friends, it's a level of intimacy we share, more than a radio set, right? I think so.","tags":"thoughts","url":"https://fengxia41103.github.io/myblog/attention.html"},{"title":"Winter evening","text":"Noah's Kumon arts... what can I say? It's rather funny to watch his arts, though he was distracted. But it's ok. He is doing well. Another evening w/ beautiful sunset. It's has been the best decision to live here, being able to look out the window and see such a wonder. Noah is like my lucky star. Only with his instinct could we have been so lucky. He's at mom's place today. Was thinking to join him, but then was in the middle of getting netbox work the way I want, so it became another evening just by myself. The other day, Google photo prompted me a photo of Noah sitting on horse back, and it was dated 2018, two years ago. Wow, I remember the event, when he and I were visiting my dad, and we were invited for a lunch in this fancy place by this rich son of my dad's neighbor. Both his daughters and himself ride horses, and actually own horses. So for the first time in his life, Noah got to sit on a horse. I told him about the photo and how it makes me feel time flying by, and he said he was actually scared at the moment because the horse looked HUGE. It was, indeed, makes me wonder how soliders could have fought against such a thing — just imagine when it was running towards, and you were like an ant comparing to its size. Courage, I guess, and perhaps, desperation. Seeing that photo made me miss dad. I haven't been able to make the yearly trip to see him due to Corvid. Unlikely this is be eased anytime soon, even w/ vaccination. I can see him in Wechat group. He is doing, as usual, but I dreamed about him quite often recently. I don't feel anything is up yet. But it's an uneasy feeling. A friend of mine shaved her head, like completely! Unbelievable!! and it looks awesome on her! It's really cool, I have to say, especially when woman does it. I guess it has this wow effect not only because she does look pretty cool in it, but because it's unexpected. Maybe I'll shave mine also someday, just to feel, different, I guess, and it's rather a statement, of something. But right now, I don't have anything so strong and dear to claim. So not yet, not yet. Her shave actually reminded me again that woman met in Shenzhen, 萍姐. I actually don't know her name, so just going by the sound. She was not only shaved, but wearing only T string, like all the time!!! It was just, strange! Then you could see, that guys around her, though pretending to show respect, always had an eye wondering around her ass for a peek. Dark, isn't it!? I know. It was just a weird scene when she was around. I don't know her story, why she was taking that style. Had some chats w/ her. I think she was fine, somehow mellow even, but maybe just for her own protection that she wanted to show strength that way, I guess. Picked up a line from 袁游 the other day, not by 袁sir himself, but one of his substitute, and that line annoyed the hell out of me. It goes like this, \"As you know there are roughly two types of civilization (actually I think he meant culture , but here for literal translation) — west and east. East is represented by mostly China and Japan, and you know Japanese culture came from China, therefore...\" Out of the mouth of some 20 year old, though knowledgeable he is, is totally disgusting. I think this is now passing the symptom of nationalism . This is outright arrogant and self-centered. Not only there are more than West and East, but within East there are more than just China and Japan! I haven't traveled as much as I wish, but trips to Cambodia showed me clearly how wonderful their past has been! It's an incredible sight seeing the Ankor Wat, the beautiful carvings on the wall and stones, so beautifully done. It was totally breathtaking. And honestly, please, stop always linking Japan to China as if they are a son born without talent and is still stupid — this is as typical as some Chinese parents treating their kids, that they think they will never grow up, never understand much, and never good enough, for the parents ! Bullshit! Japan may borrowed a lot from China, but they have not only preserved history better, but have developed and built many wonderful things based on the learning. It will be totally bizarre if Newton's first grade teacher said that regardless Newton's achievement, he still owed all his to the teacher. China has $$ to boast, but its mind is as inferior as days of Opium war, unenlightened, and bogus.","tags":"thoughts","url":"https://fengxia41103.github.io/myblog/winter%20evening.html"},{"title":"知乎, 名词","text":"Watching the capitol riot was rather an exciting experience. But of course, that's because I was hiding behind a screen, out of harm's way, as if we are watching a war movie, sure, go for it guys, charge, bring on the big guns and explosions and loud sound effect, whatever, oh, where is my popcorn, honey!? But that's wrong, isn't it? or is it? That's the dark side of a human, myself included, that lip service is always wonderful and rewarding, and the bloodier it is, the more arousing your senses become. What is this!? Gladiator mode!? Now, looking at comments on 知乎 , that is just totally disgusting ! But I'm asking myself, why so? why I feel them disgusting!? Is it just because I don't like Trump? or just to take a stand of the event while myself really knows nothing about politics nor these people inside the Capitol Hill? and why the word, people ? the people This is interesting, because so many of 知乎 posts used the word, 人民， the people. But I beg to disagree. First of all, what is the people ? To the least, I would say that these men and women don't represent me. So if they are the people, or representing the people, well, I never agreed, nor agree now. But I do consider myself part of the people . Well, so let's say we don't use the word the people , then what!? What do you use to describe these, people!? Yeah there are other words used in th news, mobs, rioters, and so on and on, but again, someone like me will also object their use because of so and so.. so I guess the reality is, we have to pick a word to describe these, but no single word will be satisfactory to all ears. Therefore, the momen an even is being described, the opinions, which themselves are noting but a version of description, thus also totally dependant on the words, will be split. This is just a given! So the logic works like this: I use \"A\" to describe (my opinion) You use \"B\" to describe (your opinion) Because we can't agree on using only A or B, we have split opinions. So with this logic, the way to unify opinions will be to eliminate A or B → what is this then, censorship!? Dark logic, isn't this!? So, can we then say that disagreement is really a built-in limitation of human language!? ← sounds so, doesn't it? Further, this word the people have been abused so much, imho, recently in the politics that it really needs to be stopped. The word had a glory tone, making it sound noble and correct as if by default. This is especially promoted by propagandas such as the China medias. But I have argued and heard arguments before, which I couldn't agree more, that we are born as citizen, not the people , because, we define the scope of the people ? In China, it's the authority, some invisible face says \"you are now one of the people, oh, no, sorry, now you are outside this camp now\", that kinda of arbitrary BS, or I call tags, which, when slapped on you, is just like labeling you as criminal, or Jew, or witch, or whatever, so to outcast you from life, trashing you down ← honestly, the word doesn't matter at all, because it's only to serve a sentimental purpose, with a sole gole to arouse a certain emotion inside some targeted audience, and viola, my behavior is thus justified, while you are doomed — familiar!? You should be, because every single crime against mankind had been committed using this tactic, no exception. And the great danger of this tactic is that label is so damn cheap, that it in turn makes victim's life, cheap. So really, stop calling us the people , not until we have abolished its inherited correctness which is the core of its abuse. It should be a neutral word that means nothing but a group of somebody who share a common interest of something. Period. Just like when we say, the janitors, the taxi driver, the cooks, there isn't any emotional justification in these labels, thus will not become a label for crime. It's only when the lable is emotionally charged that it now morphs into a weapon of offence, a club that can knock somebody down, then the question becomes who holds the club, and who is on the other side . violence → fear What is happening in these posts? I can accept a different opinion, a wish for a downfall of your opponent. But a cheer, or a justification, for violence? I have stated at the beginning about the gladiator mode, which I start to feel is an inherent dark side of human being. So if we do recognize it a devil, shouldn't we then remind ourselves to keep it in its cage, as much as we can, but not cheering when it breaks out once a while!? I'm not a pacifist who is horrified by any violence. I think certain situation does call for action, which will be violent. What the purpose that will be, I don't know. Each action taker has his/her justification, of course. Some you agree, some you don't. It's easy to damn the ones you disagree with, but this is completely relative — each side thinks his opinion is the correct one, isn't it!? But as common sense goes, you don't go into a street fight that just happened next to you by two strangers, do you? Why!? Because human, or in that sense any living animals, shun from violence. I doubt anyone, well, the ones you think you have the justification, will claim and sincerely act on, that you like being part of a violence. We, as animals, don't. Violent scenes in life is just disturbing, unsettling, and fearful. Yes, the word fear , violence brings fear, and fear is a bad thing, in an absolute term! When you cheer for a violence, you are literally cheering for fear. I was gonna say the sentiments fostered by these 抗日神剧， and of course the propagandas, have become a poison of heart that made many think violence in real life is as fun and entertaining as the scripts. I don't advocate anyone to try it out so that you can now know how terrible a war is. But I see there is a flaw in term of memory of a generation when younger crops grow up with less and less intimate experience with such thing, thus thinking it's not that bad . WWII to me is still quite recent, not because I'm old, but because I wasn't born early enough to be fooled that it's all glories — the memory of horrror lived on by many many literatures and movies and arts, and are only becoming stronger and clearer when, benefiting from time, more evidences emerge, more mysteries solved, while the winner's propaganda and sentiments wore off — when it was first won, victory justified any means; now, looking back, there are many doubts, many challenges, and many critics, and I believe these are healthy and necessary reflects! But then, there is China's victor writes the history practice, which creates a Truman's life for its people , and it's just now becoming bizzare! Not only it has turned fear an acceptable thing in their common sense , but it has rather destroyed an even more fundamental value of human being — sympathy. I may have a very strong opinion against yours. I may not like you, or even hate you. But hey, watching you lying there to die will still makes me sad, and brings an urge to help. It's not that I'm super kind, it's just human. But here are these posts, which not only like the downfall of the America , but outright like how it has disgraced itself. I think we are too naiive to believe we are different, and too easy to forget that when the boat leaks, we are all drown. In term of human and its dignity, there is really only one boat.","tags":"thoughts","url":"https://fengxia41103.github.io/myblog/capitol%20riot.html"},{"title":"2020","text":"Can't believe how early this is — it's not even 7:30 in the evening yet, and still two days away from this year's Christmas. Noah has been at her place since last weekend, right after his winter break started, which is fine, cause I do want him to have relaxing time and enjoy himself. I found it that I miss him a lot when he is not here, and sincerely wish him having a good time when he is not on my watch. Sometimes, seeing a young kid being kissed by his parent in a movie, I start to regret how fast time has flied by, and he is now already growing up, and soon will be a man who may not want me to hold him, hug him, and kiss him, anymore. Wouldn't it be sad? Sometimes I wonder that I feel this way because he is now the sole gravity of my life and my existence, even though I don't admit it. Woke up from a small nap after dinner while watching the projector. Life is good. Really, I can't complain this at all — I have been taking days off, unofficially, for three days, just doing nothing, well, not nothing, but nothing related to work, but only things I do to please myself and to take care of myself — exercise, read my books, listen to music, watch movies, chat w/ a friends, sleep, nap... really, life has been treating me well. I know 2020 is a tough year for many, especially for those who don't have a job, which I can hardly imagine. But this year has been a good one for me. I got my place here in this beautiful building, nice neighbor who would drop me off some treats for me and Noah once a while, and besides money, all are well taken care of, so I would feel pretty safe if walking away for a while. Where was I this time last year? Shanghai? Kunmin? or Huili? I was there, somewhere, traveling, and was getting over the episode that was so difficult for me to come out. I don't think I will ever come out. But it's actually the way I want it, because I don't want to forget about it. It was the best time of my life. I know one day when I look back my life, I wouldn't regret what happened, nor the decision I made. However hard it was, it was the right thing to do, and the best I could give. Looking out the window, cars are much fewer in the last couple days when days are approaching Christmas. The town hasn't been a busy one anyway, especially since the students left home earlier this year. A string of yellow lights are flickering w/ some cyclic pattern. I sort of know which little house it's at. There is this old black woman living there, and often I saw her sitting at the front the house porch when Noah and I walked by. It's festive mode, I suppose, that she sets up the string lights, though I don't know how many people really look at it for more than 1 second, or notice it at all. But it's the gesture it counts, doesn't it!? Sitting here, typing this, reminds me the nights Noah and I went Japan together for the first time, 2012, wow, nine years ago! Mine! Can't believe how far away it was. He was only 4, and I was, well, almost 40. But I felt young, and looked young, probably, too. Not like these days, I feel old, and look ugly. I don't know how a person changes over the course of years. It isn't pretty, I'm afraid. But everyone goes through this, unless you die young. Many residents here are retired. Among them, they compliment me that I am still young. I guess they are right. If adding 20, I will be officially old. Yet, 20 years, is a long long long time. Deducting 20, I will be only 28, mine! What a wonder age that will be! No way of going back. So one day, when I look back at tonight, I might think the same thing, deducting 20, I was only 48, how young! I still don't know how to feel about this town. It's a nice place, really. Everything is close by, convenient, and pretty good quality so far. But it only feels home when Noah is here. And it feels just, empty, when he is not. And there is no Bunny, no 猪猪，no 妞妞. It feels, too quiet, sometimes, especially when the sun is setting, so pretty, so red, burning fire in the sky. Yet, I could only watch, and no one to share. Exile. Haven't written things for a while. Thoughts come and go. Not at sharp as before. It's a good thing, I suppose, that I' becoming calmer, less angry, and smile more. It's a good thing. So this is 2020, same as before, better than before.","tags":"thoughts","url":"https://fengxia41103.github.io/myblog/2020.html"},{"title":"Bach, and shoppings","text":"2020 Thanksgiving day. Sitting here and listening to Hilary Hahn playing Bach at the end of the concerto, what a wonderful sound! When I was at Noah's age, Dad used to listen to Bach and Hendel, and I thought they were no comparison to the pop songs I liked, and they were not only not beautiful, but rather ugly, close to being a noise... how time has changed! and how much I have changed! Maybe it's the age, that is teaching me now to appreciate this music, and the mind too fragile to handle the stimulation of youth, the bang bang bang, but seeking now peace, calm, and indeed, beauty. The big shopping day of the year. I had crave for a few things, but then, while tuning up the volume w/ the remote and letting Bach to fill in the room, I can't help thanking myself that I made this purchase, and it works so nicely, and making this moment all the more enjoyable than ever. That, however, also got me thinking, back in the days, when people were not living with luxury (well, there were always some who had more than necessities), they only had, and probably cared about, things that were practical in use. If the thing happened to be also artful, bonus. Didn't all the antiques, like those super expansive bowls or tea cups or plates, were all useful things!? Instead of just being a play thing on the shelf, which seems to be the identity of art or artifact, they were actually active participant of daily living activities. They may look delicate, but they were supposed to be durable and can sustain rough hands. This same idea has been echoed in this book, Peaks and Lamas , that Tibetan, though lived a poverty life if judged by industrial standard, but their life had beautiful things that were not diminished by their minimal living style at all. It's really a mindset, that they spent that much money on things that an industrial person would not care, yet, we industrial people crave for those arts they have but using for daily routine tasks. How ironic! So while holding the remote, I start to think that the craves I had these couple days, especially on this shopping day, is but another testimony of this irony. I should really remind myself not to purchase just because they are on discount. It would be much more pleasing to fill the room with beautiful, and useful, things, than a pile of, things that are good deals but idling. This makes me wonder, aren't we now in the Age of Junk , that many many affluent people buy things without giving enough debate whether they are practical or necessary (of course, they always convince themselves of the purchase that they were practical and necessary). Instead, they just give in to the desire, but in nearly all cases, ended up living with a thing they don't love anymore, and look ugly. It's the sense of chasing novelty winning the race, while the sense of beauty was left behind. Sad.","tags":"thoughts","url":"https://fengxia41103.github.io/myblog/bach%20and%20shoppings.html"},{"title":"CP & miro","text":"What a shocker!!! 7:30 in the morning, all hands meeting, it was announced that CP is canned, officially, and Miro is leaving the company. Wow. I was left a bit speechless, I have to say. It's probably so for all the others on the phone. I found it rather comical when the big boss kept asking whether you have any question, and now is the time to ask — this is a rather cunning strategy that asking people in a pose of fairness while putting everyone in a shock mode first. What an insincere moment! So the product that I have been looking down for the last two years are finally seeing its death. But this is still sad for me. It reminds me what Todd said before — if the team has a problem and you have been there long enough, you are part of the problem → at the time I heard it, I was young and optimistic, and I felt it was rather cynical to view oneself in that light, as if you are either a solution or a problem, black and white. But this line is the first jump to my mind when I heard the news, and am I indeed becoming a problem now that belongs to a story of an unsuccessful project? I have been so used to success that probably a defeat like this is a long past due, and the cliche of x% of software projects all fail was just a, cliche, as a convenience to quote, but doesn't relate, nor hurt. What a shame. I feel hurt actually not of any personal pride, but rather, the number of $$ spent in acquisition of such crappy technology to begin with, of the mediocre, and some just downright incompetent, people hired, and the waste of all these money and time while a much smaller team with some much better minds could have made some much better technology and product, and really made a difference not only for the company, but for ourselves, and for the technology community at large! What a waste, and that is really making me sad. It's sad also because I realize all these wastes are not the exception, but the norm. Talkers achieve spotlight importance by being loud and confident, and doers are too busy to fix things they built at the first place to spend time understand those high ideals which, in most cases, don't even make sense. But hail, in order to keep the comrade spirit, to be polite, respectful, tolerant, and so on, we shut our mouth and let the talker take the center stage, and eventually, like this moment, talk the whole ship into the abyss while everyone onboard is going to drown. I have always pictured what it will be like in a war, when I were assigned to a team while talkers are either in position of a commander, or just peer out in a mission with me, what would I do? — if I don't care, their ignorance will get me killed; but if I do conflict, well, he might pull out the gun and shoot me from behind... so either way, I get the short end of the stick. How can this not be sad!? Had a 1:1 w/ Miro yesterday afternoon. Disappointing I have to say. He gave me the official script while I was hoping to make a conversation just like two friends saying goodbye to each other after 4 years in the same trench. I don't know what got into his mind these days. I used to view him as a good friend who is not only capable technically, but mentally tough and sincere. Not anymore. I feel there is a wall between us since CP. I thought it was just that he was so busy now with his big title and we had little time to chat, so we naturally grew apart. But yesterday made me wonder it has always been that way perhaps, just that I had always thought differently. Oh well, doesn't matter anymore. I'm happy for him to move on to larger role and bigger stage. But I hold that the so called three pillars he claims to be leaving behind to hold the torch are, well, ranging from ok to not ok at all. If he is sincerely think his choice has been so good, well, I beg to differ, and I will say his view of human as a manager is mediocre at most, unlike his technical skill and vision, which I rank it as one of the best. So I guess, all these sayings can be concluded in one, that he is not perfect, either, as I had regarded him to be, more or less. Well, that is sad I would say. A rather stormy raining day today. There is some weather condition passing by I heard. Feels like a metaphor of the feeling — gloomy, somewhat lost, feeling uncertain of what the future beholds, anxious? maybe. I think, most of all, is that, there is one person on my mind I want to talk to, to hear the voice, to lean against, sob, or just seek a comfort, but can't. I heard たかくら けん loved someone and then never married for the rest of his life. I start to wonder, that is the fate I will, and want, to have.","tags":"thoughts","url":"https://fengxia41103.github.io/myblog/cp%20miro.html"},{"title":"Weekend violin","text":"Pushing open the window on this Sunday morning. Here it is, again, the sound of violin, was silent before, now, like the fresh air washed by the rain — cool, clear, crispy, 飘进来, so fit for the time, for the day, for the weather, for the moment. I haven't yet figured out where that is from. It was only on Saturdays, and, I think it comes as a live ← someone who is playing it, maybe a morning practice, whoever this is, s/he is very very good, because it sounded just like Hilary Hahn playing Bach . Fall is here. Leaves in North Carolina have not yet all turned colors. New England must have lost all its Fall already by this time. Actually it was on the news that Boston got 4\" of snow! That is, even too early, for Boston. Here, it's Fall, Fall, Fall, leaves are on the street, on the trails, colorful, wonderful, sometimes messy after a rain, but still, stepping on them feels like walking on a thin carpet, and even with some wet splattering on your ankles and legs, it felt fine. The creek by the trail grew quite a bit from the rain. No wonder no fish was found there, I think the water is too rapid for them to stay in one place and raise a, family. Ah, here it is again, the violin resumes its sound. This time, it feels rather, far away, not like last time I heard it, I thought it was right below my window, maybe the neighbour downstairs is the player, but right now, it feels it just came with the air, with the rain, with the sound on the street when cars, not many of them, driving by, on this early Sunday morning, not really early anymore, the clock says 9:57, but we just closed daylight saving last night, so it's really the 11 o'clock before. But it's ok, late or not, it's a good moment. Like the cool air coming to my feet, makes me wonder whether I should go pull a blanket, but then, it's better this way, reminds me a slight discomfort when I traveled last winter, reminds me the town I visited, reminds me .... the music is like a string, that when I'm there, in China, it strings me back to here, where I have the music, the books, the nice, comfy life.. then, when I'm here, it comes to me, just like this, reminds me the trip, the road, the people, the moments.. what is the word? eclipse? yeah, 白驹过隙, when it's memorable, when it's nice, when you wished it would stay, for long, for long... So are the ones in your life, so is the life itself, so is the moment, like now.... they are like pearls, each a piece, then, here is a string, be it a music, a song, a picture, a poem, a book, a note, a conversation, that connects them all together, even though you don't often see it at all, but it's there. And the pearls are now like a necklace, you may not wear it often, but when you put it on, once a while, maybe, or when you feel so, it shines, quietly, not to dazzle your eyes, but to make you, elegant, pure, calm.","tags":"thoughts","url":"https://fengxia41103.github.io/myblog/weekend%20violin.html"},{"title":"Saturday morning in Chapel Hill","text":"It feels like vacation, this working remote from home, that's how it feels, to me. Not only the work is not fully loaded relative to my capacity, but the rhythm of life, especially when Noah is at mom's place, just myself, sitting here, watching out the window to the horizon, to the street, to the sunrise, the sunset... everything of these moments, remind me the moment of trips I had taken, the one in Japan, the one in Cambodia, the one is Huili, the one in Kunming... just like this, sitting by the window, after a night's sometimes sound sleep, sometimes an uneasy one, watching a place, feeling familiar but at the same time strange. There is this little barber shop across the street. The barber, Ken, said he opens at 7 o'clock in the morning on Saturday. Here it is, the lights are on. When all the surroundings are still gray from waking up, the lights shine through his shop window rather feels brighter than it actually is, but standing out for sure. I have never seen any customer at that hour of the day. Then why? He looks like a decent man. So is he running away from his family by lying about his shop hours? But why, then? I will ask him next time. On the side of his two-story building, there is now a giant mural, almost black and white (mostly shades of grays, no colors), of a person with a guitar. Noah and I actually bumped into the guy who was doing the painting on the first day, I should say, on his first night. We were coming back from Cary, turning around the corner of this street, wow, here it is, this giant mural on this wall!!! It was 9, maybe 10, at night, and the weather was quite clear and pleasant. I got curious whether he did it with paints, or is a printed wall decal. So we went over after parking the car. Then it turned out, what I was looking at was a giant image projected on this wall!!! About 30 feet away from the wall, there is this projector. So the guy projected it so he could use spray paints to mark out the outlines. Then, the next couple days, he came back during day and worked on it, and many many many people stopped by, taking pictures. There were these three girls, who drove their car here, and each then pulled out some camera gears, and took photos of this wall!... and here I am, sitting on the my bed, just waking up from a Fall's Saturday, and here it is, right next by me, on this wall, as if the artist just painted for me. If there were truly God, I now have to say, I feel I'm being spoiled by him. Thank you. Election is near. Terrible atmosphere. When Trump was first elected, I thought he was an unconventional politician and may do unconventional things instead of the status quo, you know, play the political game. But now, I give him credit for his smartness, he is sharp and not stupid at all, but he is not a nice person, and that says it all. The country is split, all the news of violence here and there, the topic of Trump is becoming a synonym of Chinese medicine, a taboo, if you still want to have a pleasant and meaningful conversation. One thing I like the most of America is the friendliness of strangers, that you can bump into anyone on the street, give him/her a smile, and you get one back, and you feel safe and comfortable approach anyone for a chitchat. Not anymore. You start to see them wearing a party sign , like a halo, and you ask yourself which side s/he is on, and that deters the thought to approach them. What is this? It's fear, indeed, and that's what Trump's four year brought, fear. I wonder whether the book I read reflects my mental state at the time? Like music, the same piece can hit you so hard on one day that makes you cry and cry and cry, then, you listen to it again, and I can't find that emotion anymore! So for the books. Picked up the sequel to the Humans to New York , more portraits, more stories, but I didn't have the sensation anymore. One or two still touched me, but the most of them felt, mediocre. The author lost the casualness of those shots in the first album. Also, I feel the first album had a passion in it, that he had so many shots of a person's hair, such a sophisticated piece, a person's hand wearing all sorts of rings and stones, or a pair of socks, or a tatoo... all these, felt, more, life, more real, more, interesting, because, all these, are a part of a person, that s/he deliberately made, put it on, and thus, mean something to her. Face may be the standard representation of a person, but all these little things are even more revealing, of who they are. Sun is rising. The light is now casted half way over the hotel building I could see directly from my window. On this side of the street, still shadows, and the barber shop's light, is on, and no customer, no cars driving by, hardly even pedestrians considering the large population of young college kids in the neighbourhood. A quiet Saturday morning, chilly outside. It's Fall, and watching the leaves on the ground and some of them just falling from tree and were still dangling and dancing in the air on its way down, what a name, Fall , indeed, it is Fall, as everything is, falling down. A line from the book, page 147, a woman across a desk: \"I'm eight-six. And that's about enough. I'm ready to go.\" \"Aren't you afraid of death?\" \"Why would I be?\" \"Isn't that sort of a natural condition of living?\" \"Not when you miss your husband as much as I do.\"","tags":"thoughts","url":"https://fengxia41103.github.io/myblog/saturday%20morning%20in%20chapel%20hill.html"},{"title":"Humans in New York","text":"It has been a while that a book can hit me like that. Maybe it's still true that images are more powerful to me than words, like that funeral pic I bumped into on a China trip. And here it is, two sets of books I grabbed from the Nice Priced Books yesterday, really out of nowhere ans I didn't even remember where and how I found them! Yet, for the first time in my life, I felt, a human being, I mean, a stranger, can bring warmth, to me. These portraits are not photographically perfect at all, not even in focus sometimes, and in some I feel there were too much colors, and the subjects tended to be a lot of old people, young kids, gays, a bit like a focus on the population that are inherently weak and vulnerable in the society, thus easier to evoke a strong feeling of sympathy, admiration, and so on... But for this book itself, I will not call it a cheap sell, because I feel the photos genuine, so were the comments, there are a few that I feel are being asked to pose in a certain way, but overall, like its title, it's a human story, and it's the human, that shines through these pages, w/ a picture, or not, with a perfect smile, or not, with a balance of any agenda, or not... so is human, not perfect, so is society, not perfect, so is life, not perfect. These photos were extractly randomly, actually, from the book, while I was chatting w/ a friend about this book. So I just took some photos to show her, and had a few comments to share my thoughts of them. I'd like to save them here because, as a set of random samples, they are actually as good as the album itself. In the end, it's not the photo that touches you, it's the thought, the moment, an echo, that lingers in the mind, that, will not go away. What a style, both of them!! These are incredibly pleasant to my eyes even though I agree all little kids are cute, but the boldness and confidence of the one on the right! Bravo! Doesn't all adult have such a moment? — that you remember something important, someone important, you, even didn't crash, but will lower the head, not with pride, but with regret? That's how I feel, and I felt the stuck inside. With a growing age, I start find myself more and more admire youth, their energy, their boldness, their possibilities. Yet, I often felt totally disgusted by the shallowness and I-want-that-because-everybody-has-it kind of trend chasing taste. Especially when listening to Chinese shows and sometimes their articles, I felt even compelled how superficially happy they are all trying to appear ← I don't mean to preach that life is hard kind of talks. Rather, I felt a disappointment that such a wonderful mind is wasted by directing his/her focus to those BS. And here it is, a beautifully phrased statement I truly felt it's the strength of youth, and youth alone, can, and should, claim. She, is beautiful. What is humanity? a sympathy? a willingness to help, to share, and to care? If skateboard has been an icon of youth who spent hours outside home, hanging out w/ friends, and not studying, then I learned something entirely new to me, today. Not only I'm charmed by her smile, but am won wholeheartedly by her mind. What a noble idea! Guess what popped into my mind then? 匠人... how, unromantic was I!!!! I really like the answer, because myself wish to know what is important, and what is not, so that I don't end up wasting the remaining of this life but for something worthwhile, such as catching a fleeing moment, a changing shadow. I don't know which character is this in Kafka's novels. Tried to read one the other day, the Trial , couldn't finish it. I remember in college reading the Chess Story , very, agonizing story, that the guy was playing chess in his own mind and was driven rather crazy if I recall. I'll probably revisit these books someday. Later in life? I don't know. I don't whether aging will help to understand them. I do think the puppet show's markups are magnificantly done. It's a cliche that gay are good at style and dressing up. Just look at this! This is far more than a style, but rather, a point of view of this world, that here I am, and I think I am beautiful. This, made me want to cry. Yes, I thought of my dad — yes, the mind can be gone. But, there is still the heart. A letter from boyfriend, a letter from prison, hand written... except the prison part, that will be me, and I wish my letters were also happy letters, to the one who read them ~~","tags":"thoughts","url":"https://fengxia41103.github.io/myblog/humans%20in%20new%20york.html"},{"title":"Medical miracles","text":"This is a topic I have always wanted to write about and research, because, there are too many times that myself gets tripped up by arguments or stories presented by someone, that sounds quite logical and reasonable, but tickles me inside that something isn't right . But, what is it? I haven't been able to pin down. The reason I call this article \"logic fallacies\" because fundamentally I believe the something is a wrong in its logic, its way of fabricating a causal relationship whereas there isn't one. I truly want to understand their method in order to identify them and expose them (honestly, I have this urge to open a lecture, a school maybe, in China, to talk to people of my findings, if any, so to apply these to other stories audience can relate and see the common pattern.. what can I say? I'm a big fan of patterns). This is probably viewed as an example of those epics of western medicine vs. Chinese medicine. Here is a miracle doctor who treated a patient, often the story teller him/her-self with success , such as prolonged life (or avoiding death completly), while the same person has been seeking medical treatment from hospitals, but has been told no more can be done (thus, a death sentence). Therefore, the contrast is: Hospital doc Miracle doc Follow western medical practices Unconventional practices, doesn't even need to be medical Nothing we can do to improve or change this condition Prolonged life, and sometimes even healed And the conclusion to follow is that there are powers out there which we don't understand, and such unconventional practice can be more effective in some circumstances. To make the statement more personal and sounding, story teller is often professional trained to believe in western science, such as a doctor him/her-self, but that belief is now shaken. There are multiple logic fallacies in play. Let me try to explain one by one. it implies causal, but there isn't one The story didn't use the word because explicitly, but its logic is clearly pointing to a causal relationship that patient's improved condition is the result of whatever done by this miracle doc. So the equation is: Because the miracle doc did A, patient's condition improved. First of all, patient's condition improved is a necessary condition, thus can not derive that miracle doc did A. In other words, enumerating however many patients who have improved or survived after the hospital sentences, will never get us to draw conclusion that miracle doc did A (or B, or C, or any). Second, in order to establish such a causal relationship, one must isolate the changing factor of the patient's life to one and only one — miracle doc's intervention. If we can't establish such a controlled environment, even in lab, how do we know it's not some street food the patient has eaten last Wednesday that has done the trick!? Or, for that matter, if we introduce the butterfly effect, why not a South America bufferfly who has done the trick!? There are endless possibilities out there, each is equally true (or false) as the intervention. Unless we have a way to rule those out, picking one out of a haysack is clearly not convincing. it is self-contradicting Another cornerstone of the story is that hospital has drawn a conclusion (which, unfortunately, isn't good for the patient's ears/heart), thus enter the miracle doc when no hope is in sight. But, let's consider the transition from hospital's decision to the miracle doc. If the miracle doc is to take the hospital's conclusion as an \"assumption\", thus using his practice to challenge its legitimacy, which, in all these stories, is to prove the assumption wrong, then apparently, a single case is not gonna do it. Let's say hospital determines 100 patients beyond hope, and they all went to this miracle doc. If miracle took place 10 times, we still have 100-10=90 patients who die just as the hospital predicted! If only presented by the numbers here, one would immediately think hospital is a better prophet than the miracle doc -- what it said actually came true! So in this case, the story has just defeated its purpose ~~ Alternatively, the miracle doc says, \"I'm only taking patients that hospitals don't take anymore\", meaning I'm only treating patients who have run out of hope w/ hospitals, then, why are you now **trusting the hospital's conclusion (=out of hope) as your foundation, while your eventual conclusion is that hospital was wrong! And if the conclusion stands, wouldn't it then mean that hospital's conclusion was also wrong, therefore, these patients didn't run out of hope when they came to you! — in either way, you see the logic is self-contradicting, the premise and the conclusion is constantly at war, and in no way both can be true at the same time! Let's put this way: hospital in this sense is being staged as a middleman, if I can get to the God (the miracle doc), why bother to try the inferior middleman? Let's go straight to the source! treating exception as a rule I have argued against science before. I'm not here to retract my criticism of it. While too many things are being called scientific , when they are, I want to use one necessary condition of science for the following argument — how repeatable is it!? Being scientific, or engineering for that matter, to me, meanings the same outcome is achieved whenever the same inputs are given. Now apply this to the story. First of all, hospital saw and cures far more patients than probably the life time of this miracle doc. This I don't think anyone wouldn't agree with. Second, if we collect some percentage of improvement on both sides, guess which one has better score!? The fallacy is treating an exception as the rule. And honestly, if you can't repeat your trick reliably, coming to you will be like drawing a lottery for cure — it's not a doctor, it's just dumb luck! using a non-fallable statement After the challenged listed above, the defense has retreated to be \"You have to admit that Chinese medicine has its value\", or, \"There are things we don't know, right? So it could be just your ignorance that you can't comprehend the power of this miracle\".... \"Everyone has a preference. I believe it, and I don't force you to agree with me\" The problem of the first two are simple → they can not be proven right or wrong, because they are perpetually true ! ← yes there is always things we don't know (actually by definition, or, rather ironically, this is the view of science, not the view of metaphysics or religion, which these miracles actually belong), and yes I could very well be ignorant of this miracle method. But, if I ever turn around these sentences to them, without changing a single letter, they are also true! and that is exactly the problem! — when it is forever true, it's really just a big stick to end discussion. The last one is tricky, because it literally puts the story now into a religious sphere, in which science does not have a seat. Therefore, there is no point of discussion or debate anymore because no ground can be built upon — it's like in an olympic game, and now we decide to scratch the rules in the middle of a race, who will be the winner, or loser, or anything!? The entire race has now lost its meaning.","tags":"thoughts","url":"https://fengxia41103.github.io/myblog/medical%20miracles.html"},{"title":"Conflicting course","text":"Watching this youtube , it suddenly occurs to me, what I have been debating with myself — the technology and responsibility , why technology needs to reflect on what this technology really means, even in a hindsight, is better than ignoring its effect, has a root cause. Yes, it is a fear , that once we develop a powerful weapon, the possibility that it falls into the wrong hand is always there. Therefore, the more powerful the weapon is, the worse a damage it will do to us, when abused . That's it! Now, the question is, when I develop a technology, should I then consider this possibility, or just brush it aside, \"Hey, that's someone else's job. Let me just focus on make this work.\" Can I, or should I? It seems obvious the answer is, no you shouldn't just ignore it. But then, if the possibilities are endless, is theren't a way to prove its negation, right? This is the same as this book starting off that even though there is always the possibility, however, certain things have been proven very unlikely to be true, for example, that a speed higher than the light speed. Therefore, there can a similar argument that if we do \"so and so\", that will reduce the possibility of it falling into the wrong hand or used in a wrong way so unlikely , that it is ok to develop it. But then, of course, this also brings another dilemma, that if you view the world from a physicist's prospective, yeah it won't have anything than light. But, isn't light speed itself a definition by physicist? So, it feels like they are both the referee and the player now. Then, if I change a lens, wouldn't I then suddenly open up a line of different possibilities? Well, in that matter, who defines the \"wrong\" hand anyway!? Terrorist is certainly justified their deeds by saying they are the savior, and the other guy is the evil. I don't know. I think it is important for engineers to think more of their actions and what they mean, even though it seems very self-defeating and even irrelevant. I think at least there is one aspect of being an engineer that does put them in the best position to think about these things — as the first line solider, they know the most of the technology, thus having the best information to evaluate and ponder what they mean, what they can do, for good or for worse. Right?","tags":"thoughts","url":"https://fengxia41103.github.io/myblog/conflicting%20course.html"},{"title":"My view on microservice arch","text":"This is an email w/ teammates regarding my thinkings on microservice arch and a few other things happening in the project which I dislike. Read at your convenience ~~ SOA is hard, and I haven't seen it working I first learned SOA (and an IBM book , very comprehensive) in 2013. I was in charge of designing the architecture of a 3-million $$ project for a Fortune 500 company. Yes it was SOA-ed, but not, no one can implement it. I have been in this trade long enough to see these patterns come and go, every so many years they come back in a new emperor's dress. Microservice arch seems to be the same thing. It's popular in all meetings and talks. We assume ourselves ignorant if we can't name a single project personally that has successfully pulled it off. But the reality, I'm afraid, is that except a few deep pocket giants, no one has done it according to book, and it never will. SOA requires a ESB (enterprise service bus) for messaging (data), and BPM engine for workflow orchestration. Both concepts are sound. I love them. But they are very difficult to implement. The bottleneck is not technology, but to abstract biz workflow so much so it can be delegated to BPM engine, and maintenance (BPMN is too hard for client to learn) because biz logic is constantly changing. Talk is cheap (rant) It's a cheap word to make one look good and sophisticated. But here is my view — if you propose it, you do it. I'm frustrated that architects roll of their tongue these buzz words as if they are ready to grab, but they never code any of them, and they usually end the sentence \"Any question? If no, you do it\". There is another popular version of the same superficial talk in China, so-and-so technology is mature and simple used to justify the proposal is low risk.. just because you can say the word, doesn't make it simple. There are different level of credits to this statement (best -> worst, in order): Yourself has coded it, even as small part of a large proj/module. You have a die-hard buddy John, and he has done it and showed to you before. Your friend John has a friend Alex who claims he is coding it. You and John and Alex all read about it on a SO post, or a book, or a meetup, and know it's a trendy thing to do right now. You all know that Google is using this technology and it's awesome (but, are you Google?) You get the spirit. I had same conversation w/ my client in 2013. It's a common mistake non-engineer make. Just because Google can do it, doesn't mean I can, or this team can. There are plenty such example in life. Pick up any Physics book, the theory of atomic bomb is printed. Can you then build one? Yeah we all know US has built a bunch for a while, does it make it easy if you, or your country, to build one? Talkers don't care details; but they dont sweat making the claim that \"it is simple\", either. container, microservice Microservice architecture is good, but too good to be true. Forget about benefits. Let's talk problems we can perceive. It's not justified monotholic design is natively bad. One common sales pitch is \"your company's systems are all silos, and mine is a one-stop-shop\". If each micro-service is a full stand-alone thing, aren't we then creating a bunch of silos ? Modular. Code naturally become modular because repetitive pattern emerge during coding, and I hate to copy&paste. So up to 10th time, I start think to make it a module (whatever the name is) so I write one line to call it. I'm sure you echo this. I worked w/ an IT woman in 2010. At a lunch break, we were talking how tolerant you are before you want to automate sth. I considered myself pretty hardcore to eliminate repetitive works using scripts. Her answer was, \"1\". It's an exaggeration I thought. But the mentality is sound -- constantly think how to combine things into a logical group, thus \"module\", so to save yourself the trouble. Top down design. Top down to do modular in design is great, if the person has deep knowledge of the domain, and is responsible. His/her view essentially makes decisions that function XYZ should be a service/module on its own, or not. It's a very difficult decision. Whoever says it's easy is a liar. My first job was in a semiconductor company making lithography machine. The entire project (300+ people) was directly by this one guy. He was an engineer, 60s maybe, gave us a talk every week, and he knew everything of that product -- mechanical, real-time control (my job), everything. I haven't ever met such situation after. Guru is wonderful, if they are real. In 99.999% cases, it's con artist w/ impressive title. Container. Container is a packaging choice. It can't package anything. Some code can and benefit from it; some don't. The one single blocker I would consider is that it is a single process -- if your thing can live w/ it, good. Otherwise, you need other trick to scale horizontally, which adds complexity in knowledge and maintenance. Therefore, speaking \"containerizing\" sth as if it were a given is ignorant (the atomic bomb example above). My view is that a container is yesterday's CD/ISO. Fit your music on a CD doesn't make your music suddenly good, if it were bad. By choosing docker and k8s, it comes an ecosystem that makes things easier . But. It shouldn't replace the knowledge if you were to do it without them -- if you can't maintain an accounting book using paper and ink (let's say all the Excels are dead today), are you still an accountant? These ecosystems, like python native and 3rd party libraries, require you to learn, to try, and some work out of box, others don't as claimed. So, it's same engineering practice, not magic. I know LXCO architecture is microservice oriented , at least some components, such as an aggregator (API proxy), access gateway. It's a living example to examine. I don't know the status of it, nor how good/bad it is. Find it out yourself if you are interested in. Talk to engineers who code it, not manager's PPT. in CP? We can't, and we shouldn't. Service MUST maintains its own state. Each will have at least an admin interface (aka. UI), and an API. Therefore, there can't be one UI team coding all these UIs. Each service has a UI person to code and maintain and add feature and debug. Same for UX. This leads to more considerations -- how to reuse components, or not? and common technology stack, or not?... CP is sort of service-oriented. What can be done is to break up components into its own repo, its own build pipeline, its own release schedule, and of course, finish each w/ an admin interface and API if missing. Now, the million $$ problem, is the STATEs. The complexity has been hidden by Postgres & Scylla, because DB's model and constraints guarantee a logical relationship between two data points. But in a group of isolated services, it's fishy. I don't have knowledge to suggest further reading or thinking. At least, read this . Remember. Technology might be mature , but until we built one crude versioin, that wonderful theory is, theory.","tags":"thoughts","url":"https://fengxia41103.github.io/myblog/my%20view%20on%20microservice%20arch.html"},{"title":"Can you do this?","text":"The 1:1 meeting went pretty badly. Over the last 4 years I had been working w/ this team and this person, and I'm having serious doubt of the upcoming new initiative . So feeling compelled I spoke up (yeah I know, I tried to silent myself for a few weeks. But this is against my view of integrity, really, by watching the rain derail without sounding an alarm). But you know what? Negative message is never welcomed, when there is a positive one that is the mainstream. So the conversation went like this: A: \"I need to see daily progress. If that is not happening, then something is wrong and we should review it.\" (this is perfectly reasonable). Me: \"I'm hesitating to promise such daily progress. Let me ask you this. When was the last time you followed someone's blog to get the result it says? In my experience it never happened. You copied and pasted, and it didn't work. So you googled and found some other posts, and out of some trials and with some luck, it worked.\" A: \"Then you must have been using the wrong blog.\" Me: \"(pause) That's the million dollar question, right? How do I know it is the wrong blog?\" A: \"Look. Basically I need someone who can do it. If you don't think you can, then I need to find someone who can.\" Me: \"(long pause) If there are other things to do, then I probably should do those instead of doing this project.\" A: (to smoothe the blow) \"Yeah there are others\" I felt really bad that evening. I consider myself quite a can do person. I have done more than the job has asked, and has been always on the lookout to help the team not to blow too badly. Yet here it is, I'm the one who can't do it, not to mention I feel I'm letting his down when he needs someone to do this. But then, how do I reconcile w/ the view which I totally disagree!? Should I speak up? or should I not? if you can't, move aside I have heard this before, in China. Too many times, this is a catch all phrase thrown at people who really know what he is doing, by someone who doesn't, but having the authority to say so. The common cliche is, of course, that this person might possess some unknown information, thus if he is asking you to do it, you should just bow and do it. But, I'm sorry. My experience has been different. I'm not stupid, and I don't consider this information asymmetry is even healthy (see this blog ). This is the exact thing that people use to maintain power, and it is poisonous! Asking me to do something without an explanation is completly bizzare, because that's essentially the same logic that you are guilty until you are proven innocent, and btw, you need to prove it yourself. So collect the evidence and present to me, and if I agree, you are innocent. Fxxx you. This is outrageous! BS! If you want me to do something, explain your case first. And, since you are not gonna do it yourself, thus you are asking me to do it, better respect my opinion when I say No! Period. I know better, don't I? Otherwise, I would simply say, do it yourself. The saying of \"if you can't do it, I will find someone who can\" is an outright bully — \"go for it\" I would say. If you can find someone who likes to bow his/her head, agree with your view, go for it. Really. I don't need it, and I don't want it, and I hold on my view based on my judgment, and that is that. Especially I spoke with my full good conscience thinking the situation is wrong. So if you don't like it, too bad. I know there are many bosses out there who just want to \"get things done\". I get it. But if you don't know what the done is, or can tell a good one form a bad one, you are exposing yourself to all sorts of BS, that at the end of day, yourself will suffer. I'm sicken tired of hearing the high-profile talks in these days' meetings where the talker has not even the basic training in software development, nor the specific domain the product is built upon. So, how can they shameless talk about the next moon landing project without feeling a bit of hesitation when an engineer raises his hand \"Sir, but this is not a good idea\"? I feel really frustrated by how things are being conducted here. I suppose all companies are similar. But honestly, I never expect it can get this far. The analogy I constantly think of is that being a foot solider, when generals are ignorant and make mistake, soldiers die in vain. That's what is happening in front of my eye.","tags":"thoughts","url":"https://fengxia41103.github.io/myblog/can%20you%20do%20this.html"},{"title":"Earthquake","text":"No kidding!!!! Earthquake!!! Wow. For the first time in life, and I'm sincerely hoping this will be the last also, I experienced an earthquake, and honestly, that was, scary!! So while I was preparing breakfast, I heard this rattling sound from my beloved Raaks shelf, then a sound of \"stomp\" coming from top, like someone was running across the apartment upstairs. What the heck!? I was thinking to myself, how could someone be running so heavily, and how could it be so poor of sound insulation! But then, it didn't make sense because the building is make of steel and concrete, and I usually don't hear a soul while living here except the aisle door open and close once a while. So how could it be!? So I reasoned that maybe there is something wrong w/ my A/C that it was shutting down at the time, thus making such a loud noise. Ha! Untill I was then chatting w/ Ariel, and she said she just received a notification of an earthquake in NC!! .... So then we compared notes, and I now know for sure the rattling was caused by the quake. Wow wow wow. What a sound it made! What a scary thing if one thinks of it — what if the shelf collapses? what if the ceiling collapses? I'll be dead, just dead. There is no way I could ever survive those weight on top of me. Oh mine mine mine. Let's pray this will not happen. Honestly, it's not fun. Chatting w/ Ariel was initiated with something completly irrelevant w/ earthquake in mind. Saw a post on Huawei's announce of its running out of chips, thus the next release will be the final batch, and it made it very, sentimental, as a hero finally lowers his head. Sad. But. This is disgusting! This is cheap, disgusting sales pitch taking advantage of popular sentiments, but without ever reflecting the bias it has been held and promoted since. Not only the lithography is only a buzz word on their tongue, but it will not solve the problem at all. If one hails Huawei's 5G technology as achievement, why do we at the mean time trash the same kind of achievements by others!? Is there now a Chinese physics vs. the rest of the world's!? Engineers are all human. We have family to raise, health to take care, headaches to deal with. What supports me to keep itching in technology, or work, or life!? Not some grand ideal of national liberation, people happiness, but just humble reason of making a living, doing a decent job, being curious about new technologies, unsatisfied with current poor solution, even some self arrogance that I'm smart and can think of a better solution than this! Engineering is universal, just like physics. There isn't different gravity in China. A good engineering principle is applicable both here and there. Without observing it and practicing it, it fails regardless which geo it lives in. If Huawei has done a good job developing its suite of technology, great! But that doesn't cancel out others' achievements, which, in practical term, is far greater and more impactful than Huawei's. This type of post is like a parasite — it lives off a couple buzz words, but will only kill the host, not making the host stronger. I have written about big data analysis, AI, cloud computing, container, a few such buzz words popped up in the last few years, and everytime, the same pattern was played out, resulting in nothing but another in dumpster because \"it is not trendy anymore\"! How sad! and how superficial! How pathetic! Technology development is literally a course of trial-and-error, almost randomly even, that the more you tried, the closer you may be towards a working POC. There isn't a shortcut, and there isn't a conspiracy. US may have censored chip, but there are too many other weakness ready to be grabbed! Think of it. If github is blocked today, can any of the existing system still operate, let alone bug fixing or new feature!? Absolutely not! If it were banned today, China's software development is back to the stone age instantly. None of the code will compile anymore. Period. It's absolutely unthinkable if this happened. The point is, technology is inter-dependent to the degree that no single country can ever survive on its own anymore. It is mission impossible. It's not a matter of $$, not a matter of national pride. It's a fact, and a good fact actually ← again, if there is only set of physics law governing this earth, stop thinking you will be independent if only you had no foreign technology. It's a dead end. The only way is to be a contributor, not to the West or the East or whatever group name, but to humanity. The China's world view of \"either you are one of us, or you are one of them\", is not only harmful to itself, but harmful to raising a social conscience that engineering is not meta science, but hard work, hard thinking, no short cut, no 弯道超车， 半道超车， only respect to what others have proven, and try to stand on giant's shoulder, to reach higher.","tags":"thoughts","url":"https://fengxia41103.github.io/myblog/earthquake.html"},{"title":"Moving out, finally","text":"Today is the day. Moved out, spending night at new place. No bed, just a comforter on the floor. But it's ok. Had a fight w/ Noah, again. Enough. I don't want to be hurt, and hurt him, anymore. It's better this way. Sitting here reminds me the days in Shanghai bnb, also a comforter on a floor, cheap but manageable, and works for the purpose — being close to 泰康's shuttle bus stop, so I could visit dad everyday. But now, what is the purpose? I'm lost. I miss bunny already. I wish to hear her meowing now. She would be bored here. I know. It's better for her to be there, there are just more things for her to chase, to watch, to get excited, and perhaps, to dream about. So, what is this life? It's not a new life to me at all. It's an exile. The other day on the way back from 517, Noah asked me why I bought this place. I said the No. 1 reason was that he said he liked this place, and that, gave it a meaning. Otherwise, all places, any places, would be the same to me → they are nothing but a place, like what I have here right now, quiet, too quiet, pretty looking, but rather, soulless. So, it is how it feels to move out. Seven years, finally, this is happening. I don't feel happy, or sad, or much emotion at all. It feels, just, lost.","tags":"thoughts","url":"https://fengxia41103.github.io/myblog/moving%20out.html"},{"title":"Tragedy in life","text":"Dana called yesterday. Her older brother Michael, died. Had an uneasy sleep last night. Went and got a beautiful bouquet, a card, and wrote a letter. Too many memories coming back to me, reminds me of 2006. It's hard. Such a thing, is always, hard. There isn't easy way out. There isn't even a way out. It's a dead end, sad, dark, lifeless. Stopped by Amy's house, Alan walked to the door, eyes are red. I didn't know what to say, or what else to say. I couldn't speak. It's hard for parents to lose a child, especially when they themselves are old. I can't imagine how I can cope with such an even if it happened to Noah later in life. I would probably survive, but only half of myself will be left, if half can be left. The pic I saw on the China trip kept popping up in my mind — the 彝族 father saying farewell to probably his son at a funeral. Sadness has no boundary, even if it were of a stranger. I could feel the emotion, the pain, the hopeless cry, the light going out. Life is fragile, when you see thing like this, happen in front your eyes, even it is just a piece of paper, a printed photo! It doesn't retain happiness for long, that how soon we just forgot the happy moment of last night, last week, last lover. Yet, sadness, is like a dead weight, doesn't fade, doesn't disappear, it lingers on and on, consumes anyone coming across its path. Can one be heartless? and will it be, easier? I don't know. It's just difficult, the life itself, is difficult. I used to be full of optimism, thinking I could manage, come out of, keep head above water, and so on... now, it doesn't look promising at all. Life is so long that it is scary. We don't know what cards God has for us. But I start to wonder that all hands dealt are just as bad — one is born with a full body, full heart, a clean soul. Then, like wind chipping away a rock, little by little, it looks nothing like its origin anymore, potholes all over, wierd shape and angle and slice and dice, ugly, rough, part of it crumbles... that, is the fate of, everybody. How sad.","tags":"thoughts","url":"https://fengxia41103.github.io/myblog/tragedy%20in%20life.html"},{"title":"Rule and Fairness","text":"Saw an article on 知乎 the other day, titled 外国网友问：\"为什么中国 禁了西方科技公司，却不满华为被禁？\" . The content is pretty obvious to guess then. Browsed the comments and I suppose author's responses here and there, I got quite, concerned a view held by the article that there is a difference between the Chinese ban of Google (to be more precise, Google was not banned, but it chose not to conduct business anymore voluntarily ), and the ban of Huawei — China set up a house rule, say, censorship, that applies to anyone conducting in his realm, so it is an objective law regulating everyone, not just Google. If you don't like it, I don't like you either. But US, on the other hand, is actively talking to his allies using carrots and clubs to ban Huawei, with, according to the popular view, the sole objective to choke Huawei, thus China, to death. There is a logical fallacy, I think, in this argument, because house rule itself does not justify its, fairness. As a matter of fact, the definition of a house rule is exactly the opposite to fairness — using the house door as a virtual or physical threshold, a house rule deliberately spell out that there are now two camps of human in this world, those inside this house, and those outside this house. Therefore, it is the exact definition of a segregation. Even worse, it is a segregation based on any arbitrary criteria the house owner likes or dislikes. So to discuss fairness within the scope of a house rule is complete nonsense because the root of a house rule is a personal preference, while fairness is a thing that can only exist beyond personal preference. If China justifies its blocking Internet access to Google using the house rule, wouldn't it also justify any business owner posting a sign \" only\"? I would hope that the answer is No. So how is this difference from China's house rule? Further, even if it is a law, well, like any other law, being it a law in physics or a law in court, is subject to challenge. If there is a single aspect of a law being fair, it is not its current content or intention, but its readiness to be challenged, by anyone, literally, anyone on this planet. Period. A law that presented itself as absolute right , well, by history, is always a fallacy, a FALSE that does more harm than help. While I'm writing this, Noah is having a Bible study w/ two older kids from a local Chinese church over Zoom meeting. Even as firm believe of their doctrine, they are not offended by Noah posting all kinds of bizzare questions regarding the Bible. That's what this should be. But,that's exactly there the fallacy the article's author has committed — the Chinese house rule has been posted as an unchallengable decree with a sole argument that \"if you don't like it, you are not welcomed here\". What this really is not a house rule, actually. On the contrary, it is still a belief system, an ideological camp, that manifests the idea of 非我族类，其心必异, which then, leads to one and only possible consequence, intolerance . This, is another case in point I have said in other articles before, that author such as this is a coward. S/he is afraid to admit the true cause of such action is based on ideology, but instead, making it a subject of law and order, so to give the idea a sense of neutrality and objectivity. This is rather pathetic. Why am I so afraid of admitting my belief in an ideology, and stand the fight and challenge on that ground and that ground alone, if I feel confidence of my view and my act? Even worse, in some of the responses it was positioned that house rule was such in order to protect the people.. well, I have had enough writing on people , which to me is a huge neon sign of fallacy. And is protected from what!? In a response it was asking why then Stackoverflow is also not accessible. I know! When I was traveling, it puzzles me that SO was not accessible, or was painfully slow, for no apparent reason! What's there that is ideological!? I mean, does using an API or a Python call harming the house in any fashion? Arguably it can be, because it can be used to access harmful information. But then, if the entire Internet is really just an infinite pool of information, it becomes pointless then in this chain: api → info → harmful belief → ban. So literally, this becomes a ban on information itself. Dark age, isn't it? Fallacy, like any other fallacy, fulfills itself, forever true, and forever invincible. It is a heroic act to claim one's ideology/belief, live to it, defend it; it's a cowardice to avoid the ideological challenge, instead, keeping its followers by making them ignorant, docile, and quiet. Is this fair? In a sense, yes, because all its followers are treated the same way — a walking dead.","tags":"thoughts","url":"https://fengxia41103.github.io/myblog/rule%20and%20fairness.html"},{"title":"Should I","text":"It is a very curious question, and it is a super fundamental question — the question of moral compass. Isn't there thing that we shouldn't do, without reason/condition/excuse? If so, how do we determine? It all started w/ a regular struggle with Noah and his homework today. He didn't do his Kumon, but claimed he did. The conversation went around and around with common excuse that \"I can't focus\" \"why do I need to catch up all these\" \"I didn't lie\", and on and on and on. Led him to the sidewalk outside the house, and asked him to rob a car or a neighbour if no one is going to catch him, and he refused to do so. So I was trying to make a point that there are things that are wrong to do, thus we don't do it, regardless whether we will be caught or what the punishment can be. Yes there is always a fear factor that restrict our behaviors, and that's in the realm of law. But there is another realm, and that's your moral. Unfortunately, as of writing, I think his moral is very weak, and on some aspects simply don't exist. It sounds pretty cliche, or normal, for a child. But I'm struggling w/ this view , because there are things that so fundamental and core that there is a native recognition, inborn understanding, that we don't them, like killing someone walking by, stealing neighbor's whatever, or, lie. I start to realize lying is a tendency that, in a way, is an original sin, that everybody carries. We lie because we are caught in a scenario that the truth will hurt yourself, thus we choose to lie so to pretend things didn't happen that way, or that we could get away unnoticed. The root is that we had an action we feel shameful to admit, so we lie. But it's more than a matter of convenience. It's poisonous, contagious, and even more humiliating than the mistake you are trying to cover. Christian will bring up God as the police that you have to face him eventually for your lies. Noah doesn't face God, and I don't believe in Him yet. So what hold us not to lie? Apparently nothing. So Noah chose to lie about his homework, over and over and over, and punishment such as taking away his TV time, or grounded for the day, or a lecture by me, none worked, none checked this habitual instinctive reaction in such circumstance. So are we then doomed? I think we are. But it makes it even more, rewarding, if we face the impossibility, and fight to do the right thing — be honest w/ my mistake, be apologetic to my wrong dealing from time to time, be regretful w/ what I could have done differently for a better outcome. It is difficult, and many times I fell just like he did, because I didn't see so, or because I didn't feel lying was an unbearable shame... many many times. Yet, I always picture myself one day lying on my death bed, looking back at myself and my life, there are moments I feel proud of myself, that I defeated this native tendency and chose the harder course because it was the right thing to do . It may have hurt me one way or another, and probably made no difference at all. But I felt proud, of myself, of the courage I had, of the person in that moment who made that choice. Honestly, those moments were the only thing that made you, and your life, worthwhile. Few of us leaves any legacy behind as fortune and fame. Most of us will pass like a dust in the wind, left no trace, and have been forgotten as soon as we are dead. But we passed this world once, passed this life once, experience, had. In those moments of honesty, you didn't just pass by, you were immortal. I wish one day Noah will read this, and wish then that he would understand, and agree w/ my argument. I wish.","tags":"thoughts","url":"https://fengxia41103.github.io/myblog/should%20i.html"},{"title":"Cart and Horse","text":"It's a turmoil time, in America. It's a huge confusing time, that the Corvid-19 is being used as a case in point that China has done a brilliant job controlling the virus, while US is failing the test miserably, systematically. On top of all these, there is the racial fight, that all lives matter, or some lives matter, or B life matters (only?), and the looking back for redemption of historical sin, be it slavery, Columbus being a terrible person (and he was, based on what I heard on YouTube, and Noah confirms that), and so were the other many famous figures whose statues are now being questioned, toppled, hailed at its destruction, at its disfiguring, at its humiliation, at its deglorification. But then, it is a slippery slope, because, where would we stop? Whose status can still stand if viewing in such a hindsight judging w/ modern day criteria, or moral threshold we believe today, but may not be so back then? This is the same dilemma of the In Defense of History how we can study history, or even view history, and ever be objective , neutral , factual ← it is theoretically impossible.cThen, what's on the other side of all these good words !? → bias, prejudice, discrimination, and so on. The logic seems to be in a loop, that cart and horse, chicken and egg, which goes first? Many of the articles criticizing America's failure of dealing w/ virus and other social issues are rooted in a premise, in my opinion, that US has all the capacity to make a happy life for its citizens (and the entire human race), but it failed to do so, because it's so illy prepared that resulted in shortage of masks, ventilators, hospitals, jobs, and on and on and on, and therefore, as a consequence, people die, suffer, not having the American dream. However, who don't we question these, assumptions, first!? Who said American should be granted with such a life? Why would hospital stock enough ventilators while it doesn't know, and would never be able to predict, how many it needs for the next, emergency? And even once we know the wave is coming, how would we be so sure that we could have just stock up and ramp up, and will be ready for the hit, if we had chosen!? Honestly, even w/ good preparation and sincere effort as hoped, a disaster strike will still be, disastrous. It's like wearing thick clothes when removing a hornet nest from your porch — yes it will make the sting less painful, but no it's not a solution, thus should not be the goal on its own. Rather, you should start asking why hornet decides to put a nest there, and anywhere else he could live peacefully with you — after all, hornet didn't nest there just to annoy you. Sorry, he puts there because he didn't know it's YOUR HOME, and he sees it only a suitable place for his purpose, and likely you probably have driven him there because he doesn't have any woods, grasses, trees, shades, to build anymore since you wiped the environment out to build your highways and houses! Same here. Virus is not a phenomenon that God is punishing human. It has been in the nature, somewhere, until it touches one out of thousands of living things it touched already, human. We view them as evils, and they are, to us. But it's only a relative thing. We human are arrogant, just like we think American is arrogant, that we think we deserve a certain type of treatment, that the world, or the planent, or the universe, should bend to our will, cater to our interest, and satisfy our desire. That, is the root of all these, ill feelings. I don't mean we should give up expectation, because that is not humanly possible. But I do think we should reestablish a discussion of social contract, that means two parties enter an agreement, and each end holds right, but more importantly, responsibility. The fight, if is a mean to bring the other person to the negotiation table, is necessary, but is not a mean to claim a victory, because negotiation is not a mark of either victory or defeat — it should be the starting point when two sides are now on the same footing, no more, no less.","tags":"thoughts","url":"https://fengxia41103.github.io/myblog/cart%20and%20horse.html"},{"title":"Racial","text":"There are many reflection articles these days after the George Floyd event, and I found them quite interesting because I think there are many problems in their implication and logic. The other day Noah and I went to see a protest in downtown Chapel Hill, and a sign said essentially \"if you are not solution, you are part of the problem\". I knew this line at work, but now in this context, I found it misleading also. right to be silent First of all, the advocate to voice your stand. An article asking the Chinese in America to take a stand and voice your opinion, because, if you don't do so to support the ones in need, there would be nobody to do for you when they come to you. That's the logic. But here is a problem. In my view, the right of taking a stand of any kind, is the same right as me observing a silence. They are the same right, equally true, they are my decision. Period. The risk of being bulled because I'm silent is real, but that's exactly the problem we are fighting — I shouldn't fear being silent, just as I shouldn't be shamed being loud of my opinion, either. origin of sin Second, the origin of sin. This is a really flawed base for argument. The often quoted fact that slaves were dealt inhumanly and involuntarily requires clarification, because on the surface they were so, but there are more to it, according to my own common sense. No 1., you can't just claim you are 满族 just because you have a funny surname, or a unique hair style. How do you prove the origin of your ancestor? Wouldn't it be already a discrimination if the origin is a default just because of the skin color? Further, slaves at the time were purchased, like your refrig, with the sole purpose to be in production and serve. I can't picture anyone at home constantly want to give the refrig a kick or smash it to pieces entirely, and felt happy about ut — then what, buy a new one, or live w/o a refrig!??? So were the owners of these ancestors — they must be brutal and blunt, just like capitalist maximizing your workload, but they don't have an inborn tendency to destroy you at will just for the heck of it. It doesn't make sense. These types of origin of sin statement is nothing but a 道德至高点, and is exactly the same fault as saying that race so and so is inferior — because these things can't be changed, you don't choose your parents, thus you don't choose race, or color, or hair, or eye, or height.... and you don't choose what happened 400 years ago either. It happened. We can't change that. If we don't like it, let's not make it happen again is all we can do. minority = victim? Third, minority vs. majority. Such categorization is itself, a BS. If taking society as a whole and we slice it, I bet there are many slice sample in which the minority in one sample group is the majority in another. Then what, does it then make the minority in that sample a bully target? can it derive that you, as the majority in this sample, has a tendency to bully? Of course not. Neither. Being minority is only measured by one dimension, population, and that doesn't lead to whether it's bullied, or it need protection, or it's precious because it is rare. Well, if population is the root cause, how about 6-7 kids per couple encouraged by a fat check per kid at birth! then who will be the minority in 20 years? do you think that solves the problem? Of course not. Thinking us as minority is nothing but a victim sentiment — it's the same as the origin of sin, that we have predefined ourselves to be a victim, and of course, then there will be many examples and cases to prove that we are ← by the same token, I bet there are also examples and cases that prove we are not , then what? equal of what? Next, equal right. It's tempting to announce that the ultimate goal for everybody is to have equal right. I believe this is a misread of the \"we are born equal\" — first of all, we are not born equal, as anyone's body can testify, how come they have that beautiful face and I don't!? There is a slogan of \"equal access to opportunity\", which I totally agree. The sign of civilization is that we are becoming specialist, each one of us, each one of our ancestors. This itself has guaranteed that your skill/knowlege will be in fashion today, and mine might be in trend tomorrow → therefore, it's a utopia to seek being equal in an abstract sense. It is even shaky to say we have equal access to opportunity ← if I know Python and you don't, how can you have equal access to a Python job as I do!? It's simply an argument for argument's sake. So drop it! What we can strive is an equal treatment by providers , not an equal development by any measure! By treatment I mean the mean to navigate in a society , say, I want to switch a career by learning Python, I should find teachers/videos/classes subject only to my Python skill, which is cold, objective (well, it's another debate whether there is anything objective at all). Yeah yeah, if you insist that the test is crooked, and the one who made up the test is already biased against you, then, honestly, nothing can be fair, and nothing can help you, or anybody ← again, this is just another way to say, you have an origin of sin, so shut up ← isn't this the exact thing your fight is all abount!? How ironic. I benefit from It's very interesting that many articles establish a logic that the rights we, let's say, Asian America, is enjoying is thanked to MLK and movements like those. I agree, and disagree. I believe the life we have today is a result of all of the above, of every single step/event ever happened to mankind, just like our individual's morning coffee isn't existing out of thin air. Rather, it's the accumulation of every single second you have so far lived — any change in the past would have resulted in you not sitting here w/ this coffee. So yes I agree the civil rights movement was truly a respectful achievement. But to make it an advocate that we need there stand by my color-ed brothers and sisters because I owe them is flawed. If following this logic, let's see whom I should be thankful to first. The founding fathers, of course, without them, there isn't this country. Well, what colors were they? and veterans, folks who died to protect us in the two world wars, and the Civil War, what color was the majority? ← doesn't this now lead to that I should thank for the light skin because they made the most sacrifice? This is the exact opposite the logic was hoping to convince. I think we should appreciate all went before us, regardless its color or whatever. We appreciate them because they represented something I like to have, today. They worked for it. Like I tell Noah these days, if you care it enough, make it happen, don't wait for others to make it happen for you. So same here, ask yourself what you want, not ask yourself whom you owe to. freedom of speech The only reason for politician to exist is that they represent their interest group and are wanting their gain. Like in business, the inborn tendency is that a company wants to become monopoly, because that's the definition of maximum of my gain. Therefore, the only inborn tendency for politics is dictatorship. If we all agree monopoly needs to be prevented, so is dictatorship, a single voice that says anything it wants without a challenge. The sheer fact that America is now in turmoil that all kinds of interests are shouting for fairness or whatever, is a great sign that this country, though has come a long way on the path to big government and dictatorship extreme, is not yet losing its diversity, its check and balance, and that, is the fundamental thing we should care about, nothing else. I think those Chinese articles are completely missing this point, because they take it for granted that freedom of speech is a cliche, and isn't even arousing because it's too, bland. On the contrary, the purpose of any shouting game or debate or argument or law suit is that you want to silence your opponent , and that is the exact inborn tendency of a monopoly. It's not only in a government, in a police department, in a society, but in each one of us, and that's the evil inside ourselves we must, must, be aware, and fight, individually, and together. We don't have an option here. Just like when I was jokingly complain of getting old to my doctor, and he quibbled \"think of the alternative\".. hahaha.... so seriously, shout, and have an equal volume, that's my version of utopia. Conclusion It's a difficult time. It's a time we live in, thus can't see from without, and can lose sight of things which were otherwise obvious. I still think this country is the best experiment mankind has come up so far. It's flawed, rigged, even broken, but it's a flag not yet down, and think of the alternative ~~","tags":"thoughts","url":"https://fengxia41103.github.io/myblog/racial.html"},{"title":"Thoughtless","text":"First photo of the Earth taken by NASA in 1968 Sitting here in the sun feels like Cambodia, humid, hot, the green plants look greener after a day of rain, and w/ Noah fooling around here and there w/ his primal bow and arrow, and Zhuzhu lying by the feet. Peaceful, quiet, eventless weekend morning. But somehow, my mind is disturbed, for things that I don't have a clue what to do w/, such as the long Raak packages arrived on Tuesday (320lb of them, and 15 ft long), what am I gonna do to get them over to the new place? I don't know. But also, for the subtle feeling that I wish I had more thoughts, things that anger me and make me want to express, but then, not much I want to write about, because I don't find them interesting, annoying, a sign that I care less and less and less, and this feeling, is not good. Am I losing a sharp mind? or losing a care for right and wrong, for a self-confidence that I can make a difference? I fear it's the latter, and that's what is bad about it. Did another POC over the last two weeks, an git+jira analyzer . Maybe it's the tiredness after an intense development. Could be. Caught up w/ Dr. Shen, Tong Jin, and Jessie yesterday. Putting a will questionnaire together. Gradually, I'm putting my life in order, and preparing my life to be closed whenever. Not that I'm ready for death, but I want to leave w/o much left-over regrets. Make me wonder whether everyone has an urge to leave something behind ? But then, how many people's biography really interests others? I haven't even read anyone's, including the famous Jobb's. Yeah I do watch documentaries that describe a person's life, and always finding them inspiring and memorizing . But hardly I would think anyone wants to read mine, nor would I read it as a reader. So, for a life, for a life like my Dad's, what would he have left after he leaves? All his traits disappear without a trace. His family will gradually die out if children becomes less and less, and even w/ children, how many of his traits will be passed on? Not many. Each generation is a new crop. So in the end, it's very true that we came fro dust, and end as dust. So on the questionnaire, I put down: I'd like to be cremated and have the ashes divided into two. One is to be scattered in an unknown farming place anywhere in Japan. The other is to be scattered in HuiLi County, Sichuan Province, P.R.China. Pick a Spring sunny day with a lot of wild flowers in the field. No permanent memorial of any kind. Be a nameless is not only a common fate. It's the ending I'd like to have — nameless, hopefully, also regretless, or less-regrets.","tags":"thoughts","url":"https://fengxia41103.github.io/myblog/thoughtless.html"},{"title":"Fangfang-style diary","text":"Every since the Wuhan Diary , the style is in fashion. Just a moment ago I saw another by a cousin's friend, titled \"华府日记\" (DC Diary), and it distinctly bears a, style, that I found rather, strange. It bears a style of smoothness and, calm, that, amid this Corvid-19 crisis — essentially a barbarian-at-gate scenario while so called your fate is out of your hand, and even so called authorities are as clueless as your own, that appears you are jogging down things around you, mostly fact-based events, thus reading very much like a laundry list of neighbour A next door just died last night, the city mayor has announced so and so on the news, and myself is running out of food, and so on and so forth. So it conveys a silent sigh behind all these words, as if putting a lid on a pot of boiling water. But, that's where I find it strange! — even though it wants to make a feeling of the hidden turmoil, it feels artificially, philosophical. This exact same effect can be witnessed in those Wechat 3x3 photo grids as well. Just how many times your friend(s) posted nothing but a single photo, or a grid of them, without description? Did you ever wonder what that means!? To me, it was rather, ridiculous, because fundamentally it spells an air of superiority, that the author is saying either \"how come you can't grab what I mean (as if I'm stupid)\", or essentially whatever your interpretation can be, s/he can easily brush it off at will that, \"you don't understand\", \"you don't get it\", or if s/he pleases, \"you are my soul mate\"... well, both ways are just the same, the same degree of BS and the same degree of egoism. In the end, this is just another form of euphemism , which I have deemed the cancer of communication . However, Chinese, as far as I know, loves this, and that's why the Fangfang-style catches on like a wild fire. Sad, honestly. Another aspect of these diaries brushed me on the wrong side is their title. Like this one, \"DC Diary\", makes me feel absurd. I think these titles are simply a misnomer , because this could very well be viewed as the same fallacy when we make a comment like \"yeah Americans are arrogant\", or \"yeah all Chinese are good at math\" (see what is wrong w/ such generalization ). Apparently, such statement bears no value if you examine them — for God sake there are 300 million Americans, and 1.4 billion Chinese, of course not all Americans are arrogant, nor all Chinese are good at math. I think even Noah's age understands that much. So, how representative am I that my experience is the DC experience!? Don't get wrong. I'm always an advocate of individual versus some collective identity, that I love documentaries that speaks of a person, a family, instead of an era that had no face, no name. I believe this isn't unique to me — that's why memorials w/ rows of names, like the ones in the Holocaust Memorial in Boston, bears such a powerful message that makes you shiver, cry, that's why one feels the tremendous sadness seeing others suffer , at least for me. Therefore I truly applaud a writing of an individual's story that documents the person's journey. However, these individual stories, when being played out, had no idea that it was typical or popular or unique or whatever. It was 100% for the person himself, but likely nothing for the statistics. I believe they only became, iconic, after the fact, that, when looking in hindsight, we found them summarized the spirit so well that is better than any playwriter could ever invent. But now, making a title like such is, putting things in a reversed order! → we start w/ a thinking that mine is representative, and that, is what I found it, wrong. This is, if politely, ambitious, if bitterly, arrogant. I'm sorry. You may not represent the DC experience. To be honest, you may not represent even your neighbour. Period. If I were another one living in the same area and wants to write my own diary for the experience, then what, \"DC Diary No. 2\", or a revision? I think to the very least, make it \"my DC Diary\", is better, so to limit the scope to your own, and leave some space for others to share and grow. Overall, I think these diaries have good intent, but no soul, because there isn't an opinion, a standing point, that the author is proudly taking. I believe the point of writing of such isn't about documenting a few personal events (a joke we all know is the Louis XVI wrote \"nothing\" on the Bastille Day), but that you felt something that is boiling inside you, that you would like to take note, share or not, so that you could express yourself in a writing form (or if you use other means, photo, video, whatever), and that boil, is emotion . A calm euphemism, appears to be deep, but gives the burden of guessing to the reader, sounds smart, but, well, you get my point (see, my version of an euphemism!!! hahaha).","tags":"thoughts","url":"https://fengxia41103.github.io/myblog/fangfang%20style%20diary.html"},{"title":"Git & Jira","text":"Introduction We use Jira for project manage, and git for code. W/ a plugin, Jira is able to integrate w/ Gitlab such as create a link to git commit as comment. However, it has not the capability to create statistic analysis of git commits within Jira, for example, how to know the number of line changes of a Jira (number of line changes are a good indicator of workload as well as a hotspot of bugs), and vice versa, how to know a commit is part of a release 5.1.1 (the fix version attribute in Jira)? If we are to generate a release note of a release, wouldn't it be nice if it listed out: list of Jira → tasks the team wants to achieve in planning list of commits → actual code changes/contributions statistics of grouped information such as number of commits by Jira component, or label developer contributions: who changed which file, and how much was changed Further, when team follows a development workflow, such as the popular git strategy , it is impossible for manager to identify violation w/o bringing information from both Jira and git together for cross reference, whether manually or automated. Once we follow the development chain from dev to CICD to various version of testing/QA, this dilemma is compounded even more — how do I know CICD is building the right source? how do I know QA is testing the right feature? and how do I know what is deployed on a stack is the right code? Essentially, if we agree that QA is a MUST to protect code quality, then QA is also a MUST to protect process quality. Such QA for management is harder than code's because it is less well understood, thus more difficult to quantify, to standardize, and to be assisted by system — if CICD is now a cliche in any software development project, a management version of CICD is not yet an essence. This tool is to solve this. Strategy Building cross reference is an information asymmetry challenge — we have multiple information sources scattered in different form, place, by different owner. Logically, their data have relation to each other as the status of one becomes the trigger/input for another. The strategy to solve this challenge is: Develop data extractor that brings these scattered information into one place ← 1st tier data. Checking consistency of cross reference, eg. a Jira status of \"work in progress\" should not find an associated git commit already lived in a release, not to mention already deployed into production! Derive 2nd tier data, such as aggregated statistics following their logical relationships, so to provide insight to the overall development activities measured by management expectation. Following the five-level capability model , this strategy will fulfill level 1-3: level 1 inventory: have mechanism to collect needed information bits level 2 expectation & reality: map out models and relationships between expectation and reality. For example, management expectation is represented by Jira items while development reality represented by code in git. The tool will build cross reference of the two. With growth of knowledge, we can bring in more related information bits, thus extending the scope these cross references. level 3 diff = expectation - reality: Identify gap between an expectation and the reality, thus signaling an execution gap that requires management attention. Information bits What information do we have? Following the development pipeline described in the diagram below, pretending we are development for a release called 5.1.1 , let's focus on what is in Jira and what is in Git: Jira: two buckets — 5.1.1 related vs. non-5.1.1 related 5.1.1 items: three kinds 5.1.1 features Bugs: two types of bugs: bugs found in other version, and will be fixed in this release. bugs found in 5.1.1 (maybe during development), and needs to be fixed in this release. 5.1.1 non-code related activities — managerial, logistics non-5.1.1 items Git: two buckets — code/branch that will be included in 5.1.1 build vs. those that will not be included. Release 5.1.1 branches/code: two types: new code: including newly added code, deleted and/or modified old code that was done for the purpose of 5.1.1. Following the Jira categories above, there are two types, and within each, there is Jira tracked vs. not-tracked. features: new code for implementing a feature: jira tracked: has logical relationship between the code work and a Jira ticket not-tracked : code was made either w/o a Jira, eg. ad-hoc code change not linked to a planned activity, or a missing cross reference between the two which made this change difficult to trace in term of management visibility. 2. bugs: new code for fixing a bug (remember, two types of bugs). Similar to the feature code changes, they can be either Jira tracked, or not-tracked. jira tracked not-tracked old code that didn't change, but will be part of 5.1.1 ← regression. Non-5.1.1 branches: these code will not be part of the 5.1.1 release in term of build and release. Similarly, it can be divided into new code vs. old code. new code old code Git & Jira information bit of a release v5.1.1 If we could harness all these information bits and categorize them, we will be able to answer: Creator Information Info Source Manager What 5.1.1 items to work on → todo list Jira, filtered by release Dev What is in the 5.1.1 code? Git CICD Which 5.1.1 code is in build? Is build clean? Jenkins, artifacts devops Which instance has the 5.1.1 build? QA Test coverage of 5.1.1 code? Is 5.1.1 affecting older functions? QA repo, report Application design The application is a modern data driven web application divided into three components: backend, frontend, and data collector. High level architecture data model Everything starts w/ data model. It tells what information bits will be collected and stored, and the logical relationships among them. Django data model data collector Can be any tool/script to pull information from interested information source. Gitpython and jira-python are self-explanatory. The git-jira-analyzer script is to use these two libraries to extract information from Jira and a clone of a git on your local system. The collectors are, however, only a library. The extracted data must be persisted to the DB in the backend. However, instead of speaking to DB directly, we are to take advantage of Django's custom command , so the extractor is fully in sync w/ the backend data model, and can use Django's powerful query and ORM for data manipulation. source backend Backend is Django+Gunicorn. We use Tastypie to provide RESTful API based on Django models. Aggregated stats can be either processed on the client side (by frontend), or on the server side (by backend). In this design, we opted for backend for the job. Further, we keep the backend as a pure API provider, meaning that we avoid building any custom URL endpoint that participates backend-front action ← every single bit the frontend needs is obtainable via exposed and documented REST API, no more and no less. As of writing (5/22/2020), API is not enforcing user authentication. However, backend has capability to provide various types of authentication when the time comes. tastypie vs. DRF Django Rest Framework is a more powerful REST API toolset than Tastypie . By my experience, Tastypie is easier to produce de facto API by using ModelResource , which maps neatly 1:1 between Django model to an API resource. If you need lots of special massage of data between raw model data to its JSON version, eg. mapping date to some special format, DRF gives you more machinery along the hydration/dehydration path. frontend Frontend is based on REACT + materialize CSS . The setup is also ready to use React Bootstrap . For more sophisticated UI layout and function, a Bootstrap-based approach will be better. Frontend main page Roughly there is a 1:1 mapping between REACT component and API resource , simply for the reason that each resource needs rendering at some point of a UI. Thus even for simple component such as Branch which is only rendering the branch name, we created a separate component (as place holder) so the code structure is ready to be extended. JWT authentication not implemented yet routing not implemented yet Development Everything has been dockerized. Use it for both development & deployment. Prerequisite : install docker-compose . for backend: in backend/ folder, docker-compose up --build if you are running it for the first time. You can omit the --build once the image has been built. for frontend: in frontend/ folder, run npm install && npm run dev , then browser to localhost:8080 . Alternatively, you can use docker-compose up --build . Here --build is required because the REACT source needs a compilation. However, you lose the webpack hot reload in this method because the compilation is happening inside the docker on a fresh copy of your /src each time its docker-compose up , so there is nothing to reload . This is good for deployment, but doesn't work well for frontend dev. manual intervention There are always configs needed tweaking to fit your environment . In particular you want to pay attention to: port mapping: expose Docker port to host. For example, MySQL port 3306 is mapped to host 3306 by default as shown below. yaml ports: - \"3306:3306\" IP mapping: in frontend/src/root.jsx , class function constructor : SERVER : set to the API server IP or hostname PORT : API server port For example, when we are setting them to localhost & 8002 because we are assuming the backend dockers are living on the same host (thus localhost ) and is available on port 8002 (which is listened by the backend nginx). CORS whitelisting: in backend/gitt/settings.py , CORS_ORIGIN_WHITELIST , adds the API server IP and port. This is critical . Of course, the values in docker-compose can be changed such as enviroment that defines DB port, user name, password, even the application's database name, and so on. They are fairly self-explanatory. Therefore I'm skipping them here. Deployment The docker-compose way is production ready. There certainly can be different ways to deploy depending on the underline platform this is deployed unto. For example, using uwsgi instead of gunicorn , or tweaking the number of gunicorn workers, and so on. These topics are beyond the scope of this document.","tags":"dev","url":"https://fengxia41103.github.io/myblog/git%20and%20jira.html"},{"title":"Cart ahead of the horse","text":"Taken in Romanian National History Museum, Bucharest, 2020 Bumped into an article by the Google news directory, \"A fiasco in the making? As the coronavirus pandemic takes hold, we are making decisions without reliable data\" , and its follow up discussion that \"Scientists who express different views on Covid-19 should be heard, not demonized\" . I find them very interesting because a recent event between me and Noah had echoed a similar dilemma — can we know ahead of time? or in other words, are we constantly putting a cart in front of a horse? Both questions sound pretty, stupid. Any common sense would say NO to both — no we can't know ahead of time (as we often heard no one has a crystal ball ), and certainly it's a bad sign if the cart is put in front the horse (as my current project is perceived to be). But, if the answers are so obvious, why do they even pop up, all the time, and worthwhile to discuss? Let me first start the even w/ Noah. Like many other days I prepared a meal for him, and towards the end of it he said he was full and couldn't eat anymore (and we are usually talking about a tiny portion that was left on the plate, and this totally reminds me myself at his age that I was doing the same thing, and my brother got really mad one day, and I thought \"what a nasty guy (to point this out blankly)!\", oh well, what goes around, comes around, don't they!?) So naturally I started my lecture that \"you could have said at the beginning that I couldn't finish them, and thus cut out the portion you would finish, instead of touching food like this towards the end. Now what are we gonna do w/ this left overs!?\" Well, whiling saying that, I was thinking loud to myself, how could he, or anyone in that matter, know beforehand that he couldn't finish the portion!? What about the saying that never try, never know !? Wouldn't it be reasonable, or inevitable, that he could only find out that he can't finish this much once he is towards the end of it? The definition that \"I can't eat anymore\" is that when I get to the point when there is food left, isn't it? So, it's simply not fair of my lecture. But then, is this a mistake doing the lecture? If the statement \"I can't know before it happened\" becomes stand, wouldn't he then get away from anything? Seems so, doesn't it? Like his accidents, his mischiefs, since they are all measured by their consequences, and consequences are carts, that can only seen towards the end, thus he legitimately can create such left overs again and again because, he couldn't possibly know his capacity until he tries it. Doesn't sound right either. So what am I missing? Same for these two articles — enough data and evidence will take time to be accumulated, analyzed, and even then, there is not guarantee that only one view (or _the view) will emerge, left alone being agreed upon. So, can we have all waited till then to take an action, such as this staying-at-home order, even though we don't know either whether this is doing more harm than good? I don't know. I echo the author's argument, but in the middle of this event, I also don't see an alternative if I were the governor — people (yeah, I'm using this word which I dislike) demand an action, any action. This leads me to believe the true question lies in human psych, and in this case, the social psych — why do people want an action asap? Isn't it a soothing factor that is more important than its actual result? Wouldn't this soothing effect itself be sufficient to justify the action? Does it matter that we will deal with the results later, but take the action now? Especially that no one can tell the result anyway, right (not enough evidence for or against!), so isn't taking an action better than being a sitting duck? Even after some time we have evidences, wouldn't it be interpreted subjectively anyway, that some thinks it justifies the past action, while others disagree (but even so, so what!? We can't go back in time, and damage is done, right?) Puzzling, isn't it? So it seems to me, one way or another is equally valid, or equally baseless. In this sense the action guy will always win, even by the fact that collecting evidence takes time, while the power to ac is available, now! Thus, I believe this pattern will always be so, regardless what the even will be in the future. I totally agree that letting these voices heard is critical for social health. But I'm convinced that these voices will always not be in the driver's seat, thus making no material difference for the ongoing event ← well, if so, it makes them heard even more appealing since, they don't do any harm :) What a convoluted world human has got themselves in!","tags":"thoughts","url":"https://fengxia41103.github.io/myblog/cart%20ahead%20of%20the%20horse.html"},{"title":"517","text":"Add my thoughts on how to remodel 517.

Does she know that I want to be put to death if the illness is too dragging? does she know that I don't want to be put in box and buried in the ground, but instead, finding me a bushes of flowers w/ plenty sun, and just put me there, together w/ the plant, and may a breeze brush me away? does she know that I'm afraid of pain, not really afraid of death, but will have many regrets if the person I want to see is not there? does she know the things I didn't put on paper, but has always been on my mind? does she whose name I want to hear in the last moment, the face I wish to see in the room, the smell I'd like to have? does she know that by dying I wish to make some feel the pain, while for others, no sorrow? does she know I want a simple ceremony, with only the ones I wish to see, I cared, leaving them each a small letter, with all my thoughts of the individual, how much I missed him/her, and how much sorry I am that I couldn't have been a better person for them? I don't know where to start w/ this will. Too many are not yet written, and don't know how to write them down, when these thoughts only emerge once a while, in the lights of a midnight, when I was sitting by the hotel window in Tokyo, in the lobby of the summer palace temple in Nagoya after the ceremony, in the moment I sat on top of the 南山 in the evening w/ her, in the blinding numbness when I was watching people driving by after Ray just died.... too many... I don't know who can know me that well to make this will, mine.

I'm really hurt. The whole thing started that I prepared breakfast in the morning, calling him coming downstairs to have breakfast. He came down in T-shirt, walked to the screen door, \"oh it's cold\" (it's about 61 degrees outside), then went upstairs. I supposed he wen to grab a sweater. Waited for a few more minutes, called him again, and from the sound of it, I thought he went back to reading his book. Then I got really turned off by him saying one thing and doing another (yes we have had many conversations regarding this, but so far, no improvement). So I went upstairs, and said that he could just dress and go outside and play all day, and I didn't want to see him during... and then I went back downstairs, put my food on the table, and started eating. After maybe 2 minutes, I went into to look for him, and he was, gone. Mom got up, got panicked, screamed, slammed doors, rushed to her car, and the kid was nowhere to be found. I tried to stop her from driving in that condition because it won't be safe. But of course, all the blame was on me. Then I searched the neighbourhood, searched the house again, he was just nowhere to be found. Then came back, found a text message from his mom, that he is found. And then she came back grabbing her wallet. I asked where he was, and she said he walked \"according to my instruction, and to become self-disciplined as I have asked him to do\", without his shoes on... so again, it's all my fault. What a fxxxking joke! After a few hours both came back. The kid has been hiding upstairs without saying a word to me, without an apology, without nothing. How typical of him, that he never had apologized for his doing! and the mom always criticized me that I'm using the prospective of an adult to \"push him\", therefore, the message is that I'm giving him too much pressure, and I'm the problem that caused all these troubles, and his miseries. I'm marking this day as the official day I decided to walk away from this kid and this family. No more. I'm hurting them as much as they are hurting me. No more. I'll work on my place, and soon, when I move away, I will be, gone. Maybe Jessie was right after all, even she was just joking, this kid is a loss, time to work on the next one.","tags":"thoughts","url":"https://fengxia41103.github.io/myblog/loss.html"},{"title":"Role model","text":"Don't take this as an April Fool's trick. Seriously, I'm also alarmed how I could have changed, a 180 degree turn, from disliking this guy, Bill Gates, when I was young, to today, I'm taking him as a role model, and if he runs for president, I'll vote for him. An article by him on Corvid-19, simple, precise, to the point, \"Bill Gates: Here's how to make up for lost time on covid-19\": There's no question the United States missed the opportunity to get ahead of the novel coronavirus. But the window for making important decisions hasn't closed. The choices we and our leaders make now will have an enormous impact on how soon case numbers start to go down, how long the economy remains shut down and how many Americans will have to bury a loved one because of covid-19. Through my work with the Gates Foundation, I've spoken with experts and leaders in Washington and across the country. It's become clear to me that we must take three steps. First, we need a consistent nationwide approach to shutting down. Despite urging from public health experts, some states and counties haven't shut down completely. In some states, beaches are still open; in others, restaurants still serve sit-down meals. There's no question the United States missed the opportunity to get ahead of the novel coronavirus. But the window for making important decisions hasn't closed. The choices we and our leaders make now will have an enormous impact on how soon case numbers start to go down, how long the economy remains shut down and how many Americans will have to bury a loved one because of covid-19. Through my work with the Gates Foundation, I've spoken with experts and leaders in Washington and across the country. It's become clear to me that we must take three steps. First, we need a consistent nationwide approach to shutting down. Despite urging from public health experts, some states and counties haven't shut down completely. In some states, beaches are still open; in others, restaurants still serve sit-down meals. Even so, demand for tests will probably exceed the supply for some time, and right now, there's little rhyme or reason to who gets the few that are available. As a result, we don't have a good handle on how many cases there are or where the virus is likely headed next, and it will be hard to know if it rebounds later. And because of the backlog of samples, it can take seven days for results to arrive when we need them within 24 hours. This is why the country needs clear priorities for who is tested. First on the list should be people in essential roles such as health-care workers and first responders, followed by highly symptomatic people who are most at risk of becoming seriously ill and those who are likely to have been exposed. The same goes for masks and ventilators. Forcing 50 governors to compete for lifesaving equipment — and hospitals to pay exorbitant prices for it — only makes matters worse. Finally, we need a data-based approach to developing treatments and a vaccine. Scientists are working full speed on both; in the meantime, leaders can help by not stoking rumors or panic buying. Long before the drug hydroxychloroquine was approved as an emergency treatment for covid-19, people started hoarding it, making it hard to find for lupus patients who need it to survive. We should stick with the process that works: Run rapid trials involving various candidates and inform the public when the results are in. Once we have a safe and effective treatment, we'll need to ensure that the first doses go to the people who need them most. To bring the disease to an end, we'll need a safe and effective vaccine. If we do everything right, we could have one in less than 18 months — about the fastest a vaccine has ever been developed. But creating a vaccine is only half the battle. To protect Americans and people around the world, we'll need to manufacture billions of doses. (Without a vaccine, developing countries are at even greater risk than wealthy ones, because it's even harder for them to do physical distancing and shutdowns.) We can start now by building the facilities where these vaccines will be made. Because many of the top candidates are made using unique equipment, we'll have to build facilities for each of them, knowing that some won't get used. Private companies can't take that kind of risk, but the federal government can. It's a great sign that the administration made deals this week with at least two companies to prepare for vaccine manufacturing. I hope more deals will follow. In 2015, I urged world leaders in a TED talk to prepare for a pandemic the same way they prepare for war — by running simulations to find the cracks in the system. As we've seen this year, we have a long way to go. But I still believe that if we make the right decisions now, informed by science, data and the experience of medical professionals, we can save lives and get the country back to work. With growing age, I guess one does become more experienced and opinionated because you have been there, have done that, have been pondering the topic at hand, maybe without a satisfying answer, but must have witnessed how the debates went, how other opinions aroused the crowd, how BS has hit the fans, and how time has proven some right, while others, wrong ← so that you learn along the course, if you had kept your mind open and sensitive, even a bit agitated, sometimes angry, sometimes applauding. I remember back then working in Taiyuan, I started watching TED and started speaking to junior staffs on works by the Gates Foundation, hoping that one day they will become a member of these initiatives and contribute their brains to them, because these are hard, much harder, problems than what we are solving everyday at work — imagine a toilet without running water? I challenged them that if they thought they are smart, try tackle this — it was a real project posted on the Foundation's front page, maybe quite unsexy to test (how to test it!?), but fundamentally more valuable than yet another ERP system w/ million dollar price tag. Case in point, my friend's volunteer site has no indoor plumbing, no indoor toilet, well, I should say no our idea of a toilet at atll! It's a hole in the ground in the corner of court yard with a couple planks on top where you squat and let the gravity takes care of the rest. Fun!? Try it in bitter winter night, or imagine your 4-year old using that without you holding onto his body or clothes — what a fear! what a drag! Yea, so for all the smart folks out there, if you consider yourself a good engineer, making a living w/ corporate cliche is ok, but don't let your talent only be occupied by those. Instead, keep the brain running w/ these types of real life challenges. We living in the US has been to spoiled to realize that all these life convenience has been quite recent, quite uncommon, and quite engineering savvy. For many others, it's not the cost of appliance that kept them in a stone age mode. It's the lack of basic infrastructure such as a running water, or electricity, or even a paved road, that make everyday business a super hard, harder than you think, but once solved, it benefits many, you don't need to market, no need to brag about its benefits on pretty PPT, a changing life for the better, is the best evidence and the best reward.","tags":"thoughts","url":"https://fengxia41103.github.io/myblog/role%20model.html"},{"title":"Git strategy for backward compatibility","text":"Git strategy for a backward-compatible release As a sequel to our discussion on git strategy , we have started w/ an objective that we want to \"control the release content\". Further, I discussed how backwards compatibility of releases may not be true if we are introducing long-term-support on releases, that hot fixes and bugs can only roll forward , eg. V4 bugs can be patched to V5 (assuming V5 was released after V4, time wise and git commit wise), but not from V5 → V4 without introducing some V5 contents into V4 (whether this is desired or not is the focal of the discussion, essentially, how much control you want to have over the release content!?) Now, let's build on top of this and say that we want backwards compatibility — all newer releases are always backwards compatible? This is certainly a desired outcome because this makes upgrade and maintenance easier (who wants to maintain a 10-year-old code when a customer frozen in time call you of a bug which you probably don't even remember who wrote that crap 10 years earlier! Was that me?... this can't be good for self-conscience ~~) Now what you do? Pretty simple, use rebase or merge, whichever you feel comfortable, to keep your branch in sync w/ moving targets — changes you will be interested in: Who Do what feature dev rebase feature onto 5.1 dev prior to MR submission 5.1 branch owner merge changes from develop periodically CICD rebase/merge changes to 5.1 staging from both develop and 5.1 dev when 5.1 dev becomes stable CICD/release rebase 5.1 staging to develop , close 5.1 dev , tag release on develop A few notes: Root of CICD branch does not have to be the same as dev root anymore because we are constantly pulling in changes from develop . This is the most important difference from previous git strategy , in which I made argument in conclusion that \" All three types of in-progress branches should root in the same commit, ideally a releas commit — feature, hot fixes, and release staging. \" This is because we are now assuming these releases are backward compatible, while previously they are not. 5.1 dev branch is a public branch , thus should not use rebase. Use merge instead to pull in changes from develop . 5.1 staging should not be treated as CICD's development branch. Otherwise, rebase should also be prohibited on it.","tags":"dev","url":"https://fengxia41103.github.io/myblog/git%20rebase%20strategy.html"},{"title":"Corvid-19 Summit","text":"Saw something in WeChat which truly shocked me — \"The 2nd Main Forum of Corvid-19\" hosted in Shanghai on March 29, 2020.

The entire world is in the mist of this pandemic, and we, yes, the capital WE , have not yet figured it out, have not had much experience to announce a victory in any fashion besides comforting ourselves that only that many people have died, small number, don't worry. If any, the benefit of such forum, or should I call it what it really is, a showoff, a brag, is to counter a mass panic. However, I hardly read such intention from the wording they have chosen on the poster. Even more annoyingly, it takes time and effort to make such a poster and to organize such an event, not to mention to first incubate such an idea when everyone else is scraping the bottom of pants for necessities — it's a sign of leisure, and most of all, of arrogance.

China has evolved much over the last 40 years in term of material wealth.

Surprised? Then I would dare to say that you haven't had first hand experience using it in a full blown enterprise environment — when in such environment, the challenge isn't about git itself, but what the content of a release are, and how we are testing/CICD them. You would think it sounds rather cliche that this problem even exists. After all, these are what a software engineering is all about, aren't they? But take a step back and consider this scenario: We just did a release 5.0.0. We have two features: 1 & 2. Initially they were all targeting the next release, say 5.1 . We create a staging branch, 5.1-staging and point our CICD to this so to QA them (more on this later). Feature 1 & 2 have been merged into 5.1-staging . Their source branches, eg. feature-1 , have been deleted ← at merge request, select to delete source branch. Time is slipping, 5.1 is up this Friday, but one feature is failing QA tests. So management is going to release 5.1 w/ feature 1 only, and moving feature 2 to release 5.2, which has another staging branch 5.2-staging . All sound fair and common. But there are multiple questions. First, let's set the objective. Objective AS a product owner, I want to control the release content, so that I can plan release schedule into the future and communicate w/ stake holders of availability of a feature based on these schedules. No mystery here. Regardless Agile or not, team is to deliver features, and these features will fall into a release, and release is not Agile by nature ← however Agile desires the product to be usable by the end of each Sprint, the reality is not so, and further, the definition of a release has usually two more requirements than a product being usable ( usable is an ambiguous term and is useless in determining a release): It must pass a set of user defined tests (UAT). We must know the content of the release in term of functions (aka. features). It's the second requirement we are to discuss in this article. Problem statement The problem is that at any given time, there are multiple teams and developers working on various topics — some features, some bug fixings, thus code is constantly in fluctuation. This is directly contradicting us controlling the content of a release: I want to select the changes I want and nothing else, while the pool of changes to be selected from is constantly expanding in a rate higher than an individual can keep up w/. Since all development result in a code change, and all code changes are ear marked in git, is there a git strategy to solve this problem? Yes there is gotta be. Otherwise, git or any other version control tool will become useless for software development. Two rules In git, individual code change is ear marked in commit , and changes are grouped into branches . Here we are to use two branches for discussion — feature branch, and release staging. Feature branch is to hold the group of changes of a feature; release staging is hold the group of changes of a release. It is the release staging we are interested in controlling. Assuming branch develop is our MASTER: Feature branch must go into a staging or abandoned. No one can merge a feature directly into develop ← this is to prevent skipping CICD/QA. Release staging will go into develop eventually instead of living as independent branch indefinitely . This is assuming that all releases are essentially backwards compatible. This may not be true , and we will discuss further in \"Long term support\" section. Possible strategies Now consider the original story that we have an past release of 5.0 , and two upcoming releases 5.1 & 5.2 . Since a release must have staging, we will have two staging branches: 5.1-staging and 5.2-staging . There are two features in development, feature 1 & 2, correspondingly there are two feature branches. Out of all these, there are only finite combinations of possibilities: What are the origin of these two staging branches? Two possibilities: both from develop 5.2-staging is a branch off 5.1-staging , and 5.1-staging was branched off develop . What are the origin of these two feature branches? both from develop both from 5.1-staging Similarly we determine where these features are merged into, and where these staging branches are merged in eventually. So with these in mind, we have the following combinations: Strategy Staging from Staging to Feature from Feature to Applicable 1 develop develop develop staging 2 develop develop no 3 staging 1 staging 1 4 staging 1 staging 2 5 another staging develop develop staging 6 develop develop no 7 staging 1 staging 1 8 staging 1 staging 2 9 develop staging develop staging 10 develop develop no 11 staging 1 staging 1 12 staging 1 staging 2 13 another staging yet another staging develop staging 14 develop develop no 15 staging 1 staging 1 16 staging 1 staging 2 Strategy 2,6,10,14 are ruled out because they violate rule #1 ← feature code can not be merged directly to develop . Strategy 1 Strategy Staging from Staging to Feature from Feature to 1 develop develop develop staging Release staging (dev→dev), feature (dev→staging) In the diagram I have two feature branches and two staging branches. All four were created from develop . Pros: Developer always create his/her feature from develop . Thus they don't have to be aware which release this feature is going into. Logistically it's a managerial decision anyway. But, this is to creating a big problem! See first item in \"cons\" section below. Cons: Developer's starting point is arbitrary ← dev don't have control what is in C0 and C4 , nor do they really pay attention to them when they were creating a branch at that moment. What this means is that feature 1 is fine in its own branch, but may break as soon as it's merged to 5.2-staging , because C4 is after both C0 and C1 , thus having unknown contents when developer was working on feature 1. Mitigation is to control the starting points, for example, having both features starting from C0 → if we have multiple features, the latter ones will have to consult the very first feature branch for its starting point. staging-5.2 will also have hot fix content because of feature 2 merge. This may not be desired if I want feature branch to only have feature content. Because features are created from develop , C4 from which feature 2 branch was created is essentially a random location (you don't necessarily know what is before C4 when you decided to create a 5.2-staging brach from it), thus making the content of 5.2-staging random as well. Same is true for C0 that we don't necessarily consider it be part of 5.1 release at all, but it is pulled in because of the branching strategy. Therefore, contents of both feature staging become arbitrary if not controlled carefully when the feature branch is created. Considering that dev owns feature branch, it's too much a risk to rely on personal code of conduct to keep staging branch clean/minimal . Strategy 3&4 Strategy Staging from Staging to Feature from Feature to 3 develop develop staging 1 staging 1 4 develop develop staging 1 staging 2 Release staging (dev→dev), feature (staging→staging) In this diagram I am covering two strategies: feature is either folding into the same stating it was branched off (case 3) — feature 2 was developed for 5.2, and will be merged to 5.2-staging . feature is merged onto yet another staging (case 4) — feature 1 was developed for 5.1, but later was decided to be 5.2. Cons: As in strategy 1, staging branches were created from two different develop commits, making its contents arbitrary. In case 4, feature 1 may stop working when merged into 5.2-staging because contents between C0 and C3 were unknown to feature 1's developer. Developer has to be aware which release the feature is intended so to create the feature branch off the proper staging, even though this doesn't have any material impact on the code state. Thus this is an unnecessary noise for developer and adds no value but a falsified impression that we are feature code is already contained within a release, which it is not. Strategy 5 Strategy Staging from Staging to Feature from Feature to 5 another staging develop develop staging Release staging (staging→dev), feature (dev→staging) In this strategy, 5.1.1-staging is created from 5.1-staging . This is simulating that we started w/ 5.1 release development, but later decided to do a 5.1.1 release first. Cons: This strategy suffers the same problems as strategy 1, that we will have arbitrary contents in the staging depending on what the feature is bringing w/ it — feature 2 will drag in all the changes of C0 to C4 into 5.1.1-staging . Strategy 7 Strategy Staging from Staging to Feature from Feature to 7 another staging develop staging 1 staging 1 Release staging (staging→dev), feature (staging→same staging) Pros: This is a clean solution that we have had a 5.0 release, thus any staging is off the 5.0 commit, creating a common base for all features. Features are confined to its release staging during development. Contents of the staging is controlled. Nothing on develop will leak into the staging by surprise. Strategy 8 Strategy Staging from Staging to Feature from Feature to 8 another staging develop staging 1 staging 2 Release staging (staging→dev), feature (staging 1→staging 2) Similar to strategy 4, that we are changing mind during a release ( 5.1-staging ), that we are shift one feature to another release ( 5.2-staging ) instead. Pros: Because of the common root law of two staging branches, feature 2 will work the same on 5.2-staging because it is based on 5.0 in any case. Cons: Feature 2 merging will bring w/ it C1 and C2 to 5.2-staging , which may defeat the purpose of moving feature 2 (but feature 1) to 5.2-staging at the first place. Strategy 9 Strategy Staging from Staging to Feature from Feature to 9 develop staging develop staging Release staging (dev→staging), feature (dev→staging) Up to this point you can certainly see the similarity between strategy 1, 5 and 9. Even though we are merging staging into another staging instead of develop , this strategy suffers all the problems strategy 1&5 suffer. After all, the core of the objective is to have a known content in a release, which this fails to achieve. Strategy conclusion I'm gonna skip strategy 10-16 because they are redundant after the discussions so far. It's clear that the key to the issue are two: root of the staging root of the feature If we can't control these two, we lost control of the contents in each branch. Therefore, the only viable strategy is 7: stagings use the same root, ideally a past release root of feature is staging (if we satisfies first point, all stagings are essentially the same!) Move feature to new staging Common request is to move a feature to a new release. The feature may be in progress or having been merged. How to do this properly? From strategy 8, we already see that repointing MR is necessarily sufficient because moving feature 2 will bring commits that were developed on 5.1-staging . For all we know, these commits can be intermittent works by feature 1. Therefore, we will be leaking feature 1 works to the 5.2-staging . The clean method is to fully revert feature 2 on 5.1-staging , reimplement it from scratch on 5.2-staging , then MR. ` Move feature to a new release staging Long term support (LTS) releases and hot fixes A release is a snapshot in time. But hardly, because there will be hot fixes — things you have to patch, say, security, that will ultimately change the content of a released release. What is the strategy for hot fixes? Hot fixes LTS and hot fixes based on Strategy 7 Coming from strategy 7, you can see that same problem will occur again if we are to merge hot fixes into my LTS, that unintended commits C0 and C1 will be included in LTS. Remedy is simple, hot fix branch must be rooted in 5.0 like all 5.x release branches! LTS and hot fixes If we had two releases, 4 & 5, we will create two parallel hot fix branches tracking each. Now, what if I found a security bug in V4, fixed it, can I apply the same fix to V5? or vice versa? From V4→5, yes; but from 5→4, no. See next section on \"Bugs\". Bugs Bugs are essentially the same as hot fixes but w/ a critical difference: we don't know bugs are critical until we discover and fix them; we know hot fixes are critical because they are usually determined by some external sources such as vendor of a library we are using, or of the operating system we are deploying into. Once bug is found and fixed, we are facing the question whether this same bug is critical enough that needs to be applied in other releases. Following the hot fix discussion, bugs found in V4 can be applied to V5 without ill feeling because V4's C0 is already part of V5. But bringing V5's bug fix into V4 will then bring C1 into V4! Therefore, bugs and hot fixes can only roll forward, but never backward — you can apply a bug fix of a older release to a newer release, but not the other way around. LTS and bug fixes CICD/QA, UAT, and life cycle of a release When does a release start, when does it end? We have said in rule that all development will always go into a staging, and the purpose of a staging is to have a chance for CICD/QA. If we follow git strategy 7, we will have a clear idea of the contents in a staging, thus whenever CICD passes a certain criteria, that particular commit can then be a release candidate. Usually the criteria is per user-acceptance-test (UAT), thus it represents what the user considers done . At that point, the staging can be further elevated into a official release. Again, release is mostly dictated by time line or a managerial decision. Dev (including QA) is responsible for passing the UAT on staging, but they don't roll out a release whenever. When we release V5, we fold the code into develop and tag it. CICD/QA, UAT, and life cycle of LTS If we released V5 and now have a hot fix, what do we do? We roll hot fix into v5-staging to test, then to a patched release if UAT passes. Note that UAT in this case may be an enhanced version of the original UAT because of the hot fixes. Patch release should also be foled to develop as an official release. When LTS reaches its end of life, the v5-lts branch is folded into develop . At that point, v5-staging will be removed. Conclusion To sum these all up: All three types of in-progress branches should root in the same commit, ideally a releas commit — feature, hot fixes, and release staging. If you create multiple release stagings, have them use the same root, too. CICD/QA monitors staging branch. Merge a release commit to develop as soon as the release is official. develop should not have commits other than releases. Enjoy.

Development Install nvm and node (tested 9.4, 12.1). npm install : to pull all dependencies. npm run build because static files will be served from /dist (defined in webpack.config ) by default.

In that case, you need to modify the json_data_server setting in movie.jsx : this . state = { json_data_server : \"data/\" , <-- change this to an absolute URL ... }; Of course, this value can be further manifested in a config so the source code has minimal change. This, for the time being, is really minor so I'm letting it be assuming all data json will be packaged together. Fundamentally, the app is also a set of static files, so serving them and data using the same mechanics seem quite logical if we own both the app and the data anyway. Design This is a SPA w/o routing. Idea is to integrate multiple data sources into a single view. Internal data is hoisted in top level component so its change will trickle down to all subcomponent which is responsible for render its content.

Data set is fairly simple once you get an API key (free for 1000 calls per day) and examine the data comparing to what is displayed on a IMDB page. ```javascript api = http://www.omdbapi.com/?apikey=c6638eb9&t=Wall%20E ``` Toolset Toolset stack It's always amazing to me how many different technologies/libraries one has to pull together in order to make an application, even a simple one like this. REACT : core React Bootstrap : map boostrap components into React, eg. use <Button which will render bootstrap buttons. Materialize CSS : \"A modern responsive front-end framework based on Material Design\" by their words. lodash : nice lib for data struct manipulation. webpack : new module builder that is making lot of buzz these days. fetch : a new way to talk to API endpoints instead of jQuery AJAX . Presentation Layout & Components Naming following <name>Box is a Component. Layout follows 3-section approach: header, content, and footer, in a vertical split. The Content is a logical group of a list of sub components and some static information (displayed in YELLOW). View layout HeaderBox : Place to put things such as navigation, logos. Stick to top. FooterBox : Place to put more navigation to external resources, static pagers such as credits. Stick to bottom. SearchBox : Search movie by title. Multiple matches will result in multiple MovieBox . MovieBox : Represent content of a single movie, thus it has movie's data. Movie title : Title is rendered as static information. No component is needed. SubtitleBox : Subtitle includes a mix of facts and opinionated info: movie rating by IMDB and other sources (Note: these are opinionated scores, mostly by voluntary voters). time length production year movie rating ( Note : since contents cover international movies, not all of them have this info). original language released ( Note : this does not cover translated versions done after its release). Description : Description is rendered as static information. No component is needed. GalleryBox : Movie poster and other images. CrewBox : Component for genre, director, starring, and writer. RatingBox : Component for opinionated ratings, eg. IMDB rating. LocationBox : Location where scenes were taken. Presented as fun facts. QuoteBox : Critic reviews. SnippetsBox : Make a fun quiz game using lines from the movie. EpisodeBox : For series, list episodes and their ratings. SearchBox Search is case insensitive. Given movie title (and this can be partial) will result in either a list of IMDB IDs, or nothing. The more precise your query is, the more likely it will return what you are looking for. There are two error conditions: No match : I have no control over the content of the search API backend. Thus not only a meaningless query such as \"lkjsljdflkj\" will result in an empty result, some seemingly useful one will result in the same no hit. For example, try an international title. Too many : Given an ambiguous query such as a two-letter st will result in a \"too many results\" error. So overall, search is an act of art. Suggestion to get you going: star or star war → no explanation needed wall : → Wall E sound → Sound of Music SearchBox sequence diagram MovieBox This represents a single movie. When given an IMDB ID, it will retrieve movie meta data from external sources such as OMDB API. If not it will load local data source file, eg. data/en-US.json . In general, it knows how to get data from different data sources and how to handle their info. MovieBox sequence diagram A key piece of this entire application is an internal data structure representing a movie's info. When dealing w/ multiple data sources, normalizing data is a MUST to make it clean, as well as to make error handler possible (just about any piece of info can be null or undefined , or having no value []{}\"\" ! But I don't want to have all those inline if-else littering inside the jsx sections), thus trying to assigning them a valid value. This is especially important to undefined because React render will fail silently w/o much meaning error stack trace. let normalized = { title : title , description : data . description || data . Plot , locations : data . locations || [], quote : data . quote || {}, snippets : data . snippets || [], gallery : data . gallery || [{ \"src\" : data . Poster , \"text\" : title }], video : data [ \"video-embed\" ] || [], episodes : data [ \"episode-list\" ] || [], year : data . Year || \"\" , runtime : data . Runtime || \"\" , director : data . Director || \"\" , released : data . Released || \"\" , genres : data . Genre || \"\" , writers : data . Writer || \"\" , actors : data . Actors || \"\" , language : data . Language || \"\" , country : data . Country || \"\" , awards : data . Awards || \"\" , ratings : data . Ratings || [], metaScore : data . Metascore || \"\" , imdbRating : parseFloat ( data . imdbRating || \"\" ), imdbVotes : parseInt ( data . imdbVotes || \"\" ), imdbID : data . imdbID , type : data . Type || \"\" , dvd : data . DVD || \"\" , boxOffice : data . BoxOffice || \"\" , production : data . Production || \"\" , rated : data . Rated || \"\" } Apparently there are many loop holes in this. The only assumption I'm making is that data.imdbID won't be null, so that we are looking at a real movie . Fair? GalleryBox There are many ways to implement a gallery box, eg. carousel. I chose to write one myself that will: display one image as main if there are multiple image, mouse over or click will switch to the next one. it circles back to the beginning of the array once at the end I haven't spent much time to get image into the same size so view doesn't shift when it displays a longer or wider image. A quick google revealed object-fit CSS. Later. SnippetsBox Snippets are fun. Instead of displaying them as static strings, I decided to make a quiz game out of it by randomly taking out a few words from the snippet, then ask user to fill them in. The game is a bit rudimentary that it has to be an exact match including symbols ' and such, which is quite annoying. However as POC, this is sufficient. Snippet game components part 1 & 2 : are what are left of the snippet line after taking out the riddle piece. riddle : randomly select a section of the snippet line as riddle. show hint will break down the riddle into a list of words, and show one at a time. Hints will be displayed, but not replacing the user input, so user still needs to type them in. EpisodeBox Episode data are rather pale — it has episode name and a rating number. So I decided to try out two different presentations: as a list, and as a chart. So far I like the list format better. Rating are sorted in descending order. Chart is using Highcharts bar . I'd like to have a better data source for this, or a way to make each episode a link to a better information.","tags":"REACT","url":"https://fengxia41103.github.io/myblog/movie%20browser.html"},{"title":"Cowardice","text":"So the country is entering an emergent mode.

I guess virus has always looked at us as jokes, a group of self-centered, self-important, ignorant organs, fooled themselves to think that they are dominating this earth. How pathetic! There is a true cowardice inside us, not because we are coward, but a strong tendency of lacking courage in face of aggression, or news of others being hurt. We used to criticize German in the WWII that neighbours watching the Jews evicted or even killed w/o doing much, we used to criticize the Western countries not coming to help the China's suffering from the Japanese evasion, we used to criticize anyone who was not donating to people in Wuhan.... however, how could they not feel that way!? when in today's event, I couldn't feel sadness imagining families who will now run out of income, or food, or TP! Honestly, I don't feel them at all.

Life itself has no magic, it's messy, lots of loose gears fitting together, with a lot of trial and error, and a lot of luck. So, there isn't magic in becoming a modern man. What is a modern man? What makes one qualified as one? I don't have answer, nor there is any better than what I will be laying out below. Living in the 21st century gives a perception that everyone is now a modern man, because we are all living in a modern society, most of us at least, and cold war is over, we haven't slaughtered in a global sense since the WWII, and more people are educated w/ science, w/ literature, w/ thinkings and philosophies and instant news and instant gratification, from food to sex → hardly one can imagine how much faster the pace of this modern life can become ← this, is as efficient, as it can get. What's the next? A pill that replaces food and drink? or one that makes you immortal? Sure. But eating a burger is hardly much time wasting than swallowing a pill, not to mention we eat burgers while doing other things, such as smart phone or work or drive. So really, the trademark of a modern life, is already here. But, do all these make us a modern man? We all agree that a kid growing to an age of 18 doesn't automatically makes him/her an adult in the eyes of their parents, teachers, friends, or even themselves. The law marks them so, but life disagrees. So the quality of a modern man is not acquired by age either. Living in today's world, watching TV, typing smart phones, say nothing about the state of the mind that make the person a modern man. On the contrary, if you watch their doings, many, I would say, fail to make the bar, and in my mind, the bar says this:\" Be able to step outside yourself and look from without, so to observe what yourself just said and did, and can still agree with them. \" This, isn't easy. The reality show of this CORVID19 is a case in point. China's patients are ramping down, and the rest of the world (this is exactly how the company divides the markets — China vs. the rest of the world, how strange!) is ramping up. Chinese are now hailing their success, while taking seats as if waiting for a thriller movie to start, together with their pop corns in hand. But truly, regardless of whether the episode has passed (which I think not). I believe all so called 拐点 are bogus, and virus has nothing to do w/ wishful thinking — we either understand their mechanics and know how to defend, or not. There is nothing in between, and there is no luck in between. This is much like physics — the rules have always been there. It was human who were slow to grasp them. So we tried sun god, Appolo, whoever driving the sun up and down, whoever makes the stars go around in such a way. But it doesn't change them a bit, they go around, based on the rules they have always been based on, however human wish to explain. So will be the viruses. So what do we do? Keep calm, don't panic, be honest, and be kind. However, did we? did they? Didn't they have the first reaction that the people from Wuhan were so super selfish by escaping the city, thus spreading the virus all over my neighbourhood? Didn't they wish to quarantine the entire city, the state, while cheering for the government's efficiency, so called 体制的优势, and even look down others whose authorities don't have that power!? Didn't they themselves become victim of a peace-time war zone, so lucky for those fans of the 抗日神剧， that they got to experience them first-hand what it was like 90 years ago, the dreamed about 民国， or end of the Qing, that every of them wished to go back to!? But the sad thing is, they went around w/ heroic stories of human sacrifices, while failed to realize what they have been cheering for, what they have been acting against, is the exact copy of the days when 麻风（Leprosy） patients were treated like evils, HIV patients were shunned as moral corrupted Satan agents, and Jews were sent to ghettos then the concentration camps because they were the tumor of modern society .... Tolerance , is only possible when one is alarmed by the similarity of these samples, by had a gut feeling of uneasiness when your own thoughts echo these truly dark deeds that had happened in the past, but didn't go away, and keep emerging over and over in different disguises and slogans. If one fails to be sensitive to these signals, one has already failed the bar to be a modern man — there is no progress, no enlightenment, when one carries all the fancy handbags, shoes, clothes, electronics, cars, what have you, while have no feel of the wrongs advocated by oneself. So, as long as the hope is still about a wishful thinking such as those bogus predictions of 拐点， of herb medicine winning the day, of how virus has moved on to other countries as if my turn of suffering is now over, they are not modern man. They are ancient man living in the past.","tags":"thoughts","url":"https://fengxia41103.github.io/myblog/sherlock.html"},{"title":"Virus is coming","text":"News of the new virus coming to the States is all over the place now, and the stock market has been dropping like a stone. Panic? I haven't heard many people talking about it, life is rather running as usual, but I think this is hanging on everyone's mind now, that we are just waiting for a phone call from school that school is shutting down, or an email from company that you are all required to work from home for the next two weeks.. then what? what about food? drink? necessities in life, gas, internet? — there are so much supports to make a modern life possible, that it's difficult to image what it will be like when everyone, shuts down ← even though I felt quite annoyed by China's shutting down Wuhan city and locked down its ten million residents on the issue of a government order, I don't see other way around this. The difference probably will be, how people fare well in this situation, not that whether we can dodge such situation entirely. Watched a movie made in the 1990, Hiroshima: Out of the Ashes . Sadly realistic, though I'm sure the reality back then was ten times, a thousand times, worse. This also reminded me the book I read which described life after the atomic bomb — we outsiders and people were not on site during those catastrophes thought of the tragedy lasting for only the duration of the hit. But for those survivors, it was only the beginning of their miseries. This same theme was echoed in Chernobyl's café , that people living in that area had no idea in that Sunday morning even when the military had been deployed on the street measuring radiation level rising to lethal grade. Then all of sudden, they were asked to pack and leave, in 4 hours! And? They were told the evacuation was for a few days, but they never, ever, returned, till today, till the end of their life even, cause the pollution of the disaster will not fade for another 250,000 years — can you imagine being uprooted like that? What about my books? my cats? my favourate so and so? Nothing was allowed to leave except yourself and one suitcase — cruel? necessary? victim of a bureaucracy? bad luck? fate?.... I don't know how those 46,000 people reconcile for the rest of their lives. I'm curious to learn what type of support they were received after the uproot. But then, I'm not sure I have the heart to hear their stories, to witness their tears, to stand shoulder to shoulder w/ them at vigil, missing their loved ones lost to the tragedy, harmed by it, and forever changed by it. Saw a joke about the virus, that North Korea, being an odd ball in today's world, announced that they had one infection, shot to death, now their infection count, 0, hahahaha... that's a style, one way to deal w/ this. This brings me back to my argument of the 拐点 , that there are endless possibilities of a virus going forward. Until we have an understanding of its course, and this can only be done through science, all others are nothing but wishful thinkings — I understand human must summarize, especially in such situation when there are overwhelmingly amount of information, some truer than others (but difficult to tell), in order to make sense so to guide his daily action. Therefore, we need to be more sensitive of the downfall of this tendency than usual, that by making summary out of ocean of info, we are also risking to lose sight of the picture, and to lean more on some than others, while these info are just random encounters to us — we are fed by some authorities and channels, while whoever has the loudest voice gets the attention, thus the preference. In case you want to brush up your hand washing technique, here is a NPR on the subject. Quite fun to watch ~~","tags":"thoughts","url":"https://fengxia41103.github.io/myblog/virus%20is%20coming.html"},{"title":"SARS","text":"Sitting at coffee shop and after a cup of coffee, my mind is always, springing back to life ~~ So it suddenly occurred to me, what happened SARS? I read all these optimistic beats in wechat, and got seriously worried about what people are deriving by shallow observation and an implied impatience to end this misery as soon as possible. Who doesn't!? But the documentary watched w/ Noah the other day, [Virus Empire: From SARS to Ebola], made me feel quite otherwise from these sentiments — the Spanish Flu virus killed only 145 people in its first ran, but two years later wiped 50 million — no kidding, no shit, no mercy. Again, like engineering work I do, sentiment counts for nothing in the face of detail, practicality, and reality — you can wish however you want, the things will work when all gears match, or collapse when a single screw is missing. That, is the life. Googled SARS, the very first hit is by WHO , of course, and I has no reason to doubt its credibility. It has a \"Situation Updates - SARS\" section listing its trackings in reverse chronicle order, and interesting enough, the last line, May 18, 2004 ← ah, talking about going back in time, history, let's see. Now, this news, is just, disturbing! WTF! China's latest SARS outbreak has been contained, but biosafety concerns remain – Update 7 18 May 2004 It has been more than three weeks since the last case was placed in isolation in China's latest SARS outbreak, prompting the World Health Organization to declare that the chain of human-to-human transmission appears to have been broken. However, WHO experts and the Chinese authorities are still trying to determine the exact cause of the outbreak. The investigation has centred primarily on the National Institute of Virology in Beijing where experiments using live and inactivated SARS coronavirus have been carried out. Two researchers at the Institute developed SARS in late March and mid-April. The outbreak was reported on April 22 and the Institute was closed a day later. Preliminary findings in the investigation have yet to identify a single infectious source or single procedural error at the Institute – and it is conceivable that an exact answer may never be determined. Neither of the researchers is known to have directly conducted experiments using live SARS coronavirus. However, investigators have serious concerns about biosafety procedures at the Institute – including how and where procedures using SARS coronavirus were carried out, and how and where SARS coronavirus samples were stored. WHO and Chinese authorities view with concern the occurrence of laboratory-associated SARS cases. WHO urges all Member States to view this latest outbreak as an opportunity to review the biosafety practices of institutions and laboratories working with SARS coronavirus. During and after the SARS outbreak of 2003, a large number of specimens were collected from possible human cases, animals and the environment. These specimens, which may contain live SARS coronavirus, are still kept in various laboratories around the world. Some of them are stored in laboratories at an inappropriate containment level. SARS coronavirus has also been propagated in reference and research laboratories, and distributed to other laboratories for research purposes. Research using live and inactivated SARS coronavirus – and other pathogens capable of causing serious illness -- is being conducted in many laboratories. WHO has issued the following laboratory safety guidelines and recommendations: • WHO biosafety guidelines for handling of SARS specimens (25 April 2003) • Summary of the discussion and recommendations of the SARS laboratory workshop of 22 October 2003 • WHO post-outbreak biosafety guidelines for handling of SARS coronavirus specimens and cultures (18 December 2003) In these guidelines, WHO strongly recommends Biosafety Level 3 (BSL 3) as the minimum containment level to work with live SARS coronavirus. WHO also urges Member States to maintain a thorough inventory of laboratories working with and/or storing live SARS coronavirus and to ensure that necessary biosafety standards are in place. WHO commends the Chinese authorities for taking swift action to contain the latest outbreak once it was recognized and reported, by way of extensive contact tracing and the quarantine and medical observation of such individuals. Once again, it has been demonstrated that SARS is a containable disease. So SARS was, speculated to have come from the National Institute of Virology in Beijing , and now we all know Wuhan happened to have a Lvl 4 Bio lab, now the whole city is locked down, and the whole world is, worked up... coincidence!? I think, yes? no? yes? no?... Btw, I'm entirely not sure about the idea of turning point (拐点) — I mean, is this even a legitimate concept in describing a viral outbreak!? I seriously doubt it, because it's very easy to perceive such a thing in a simple curve. But hey, let's look at a Sine wave, and you tell me which is the turning point!? The whole assumption of this term lies in that once it passes the peak, it will start to steadily decrease and approximating zero in the long run — but, isn't that a wishful thinking!? I don't think virus agree w/ this at all, otherwise, by mathematics all viruses will be, containable, because it is just a matter of how long this curve is — HIV takes like years, flu, 7 days (so I'm operating when Noah gets sick), and so on... But this is just pure naive. Why not a curve ever going up!? Why not a cyclical pattern like a Sine wave!? Why not a flat line for ever and ever!? What is the assumption to rule out these patterns? and how these assumptions are proved!? Again, this outbreak is a like an awesome reality show that everybody is now involved, everybody has to act and react, and it's like how human will show their true ingredients in front of a dire situation, here we are, standing naked in front of virus, and each one acting in a way to justify the situation and make peace w/ him/her-self. A majority of the Chinese, from what I read and heard, are going through a pretty clear struggle of \"yes they should be shut in their houses, otherwise they will be acting selfishly\", to \"I'm sacrificing my own little convenience for a greater good\", thus feeling elevated self-pride, to \"enough is enough, I'm done w/ my duty, and now let me out and play, and if you stop me, eat my ass\"... Fascinating, isn't it? I think shutting down the city was a sound decision. Creating panic by not being transparent was a bad decision. Acting patriotically is great on individual basis, but a terrible deed to be broadcasted and even promoted on government's end. I'm glad that modern infrastructure is able to support these many people being locked in a cage (actually, to think about it, it's not much difference living in the city on a common day vs. in lock down days — your radius of movement is just those few blocks, and entertainments are all at your finger tips as long as virus doesn't attack your router or your ISP). So the perception of anxiety is really from self-pity, sympathy, and boredom once it lasts for too long — the same logic when you wait in line at bank for over 10 min, you grow impatience, and even angry, but the reality is, that 10 min doesn't make a dime of difference for 99.99999% of the people (especially if you still need to go bank line for their service ~~ if your time is that precious, trust me, bank waits for you, not the other way around). It's just a psychological thing. Anyway. I feel sorry for people who are going through this. I constantly think this is a man made, disaster, not that its origin is man made (that is going to be a conspiracy theory for many years to come), but the way we handle it, and the way we live through it — like war, not that all die and no one lives through it — millions did survive. But, who wants to go back and relive those days, again!?","tags":"thoughts","url":"https://fengxia41103.github.io/myblog/sars.html"},{"title":"Burden of proof","text":"Had a chat w/ a friend yesterday after he showed a snippet of his chat history, rather more accurately, of his argument history, w/ someone in his circle about the ongoing corona virus outbreak. The argument goes something like this: Yao: The traditional Chinese medicine is useless. B: What is your job? (Implying, are you a doc?) Yao: I'm a nobody, certainly not a medical personnel. B: Then you have no qualification to make such a claim. Yao: This is absurd. Why can't I have an opinion even if I had no medical training? B: Cause you don't know what you are talking about. So it goes on and on and on.... This is interesting, and actually quite common pattern that I have witnessed over and over in chats, especially among Chinese. I sense there is a logic flaw in this pattern, but haven't given it much thought what this flaw is. But a word suddenly came to me — 举证 倒置 ( reverse onus ), meaning to shift the burden of proof to the party who is being challenged → but, in a common sense, I would expect the challenger to provide the evidence to support the challenge. After all, I thought I was right, it's you, the challenger, who is disagreeing w/ me. So why should I bother to prove myself correct, again!? Wouldn't it even be super biased even if I do !? ← that's where it smells funny, isn't it! — I was told at some point that this is the foundation of Chinese law, which essentially assumes you guilty, and it is up to the defendant to prove him/herself innocent; on the contrary, the US law assumes you innocent, and it is up to the challenger (the plaintiff) to provide evidence that you are guilty (that is his/her position, isn't it!?). A reverse onus clause is a provision within a statute that shifts the burden of proof onto the individual specified to disprove an element of the information. Typically, this provision concerns a shift in burden onto a defendant in either a criminal offence or tort claim. Can't find much of this term beyond the legal application. So googled a bit more, and found that in philosophy, this is called burden of proof : When two parties are in a discussion and one makes a claim that the other disputes, the one who makes the claim typically has a burden of proof to justify or substantiate that claim especially when it challenges a perceived status quo. So in both terms, applying to such debate pattern, it means the challenger, the B in this case, is making a challenge to Y's claim that the \"traditional Chinese medicine is useless\", thus it's him/her obligation to provide evidence/proof for the challenge. However, apparently something didn't go right, when B immediately questioned whether Y has medical training, thus if Y fails to prove his credibility w/ proper domain knowledge (and this is a very shaky ask since, first of all, there is no agreement of definition of this qualification, second, approval of satisfaction of meeting the qualification lies now in the hand of the challenger! This is the most questionable aspect of this pattern!) leading down the path that you claim itself is questionable if you don't have adequate training. What went wrong!? .... hmmm.. what's going on here? Two things are mixing up in this debate now, both, well, by my evaluation, are fallacies on B's part — the argument from ignorance , and Ad hominem . argument from ignorance First, the argument from ignorance . Argument from ignorance (from Latin: argumentum ad ignorantiam), also known as appeal to ignorance (in which ignorance represents \"a lack of contrary evidence\"), is a fallacy in informal logic. It asserts that a proposition is true because it has not yet been proven false or a proposition is false because it has not yet been proven true. This represents a type of false dichotomy in that it excludes the possibility that there may have been an insufficient investigation to prove that the proposition is either true or false. It also does not allow for the possibility that the answer is unknowable, only knowable in the future, or neither completely true nor completely false. In debates, appeals to ignorance are sometimes used in an attempt to shift the burden of proof. A bit hard to read and digest. So let me use a couple common patterns you would hear from a Chinese medicine lover: false positive : I took a Chinese medicine and now my symptoms are completely gone. The medicine cured my symptoms. absence of evidence : There is no evidence of Chinese medicine causing harm, and therefore, it must be unharmful (or even helpful). I bet these sound familiar to your ears. But then, wouldn't these also apply to Y's claim that the medicine is useless!? I mean, he can't conclude it's useless because it didn't work in one case (the false positive), or that didn't work because I can't iterate an example when it worked (absence of evidence → he may not be knowledge enough of cases when it worked! thus bringing the question of his professional training as a challenge)!? Sounds so, doesn't it! Meaning both parties are offenders of this fallacy by shifting the burden of proof to the other party. But, is it so? If this is the case, then whoever speaks first (thus stating his/her opinion) is liable to provide evidence (I think they should), but will be automatically in a position of playing defense, and since this is an opinion vs. opinion, no sufficient proof can be provided if the other party has taken the position to reject this first claim! On top of this, there is the difficulty of proving a negative . As in this case Y's claiming that the medicine is useless (a negative) requires him to proof it never worked, which apparently, is not true (as before the modern medicine, these traditional ones had to play a part in healing people, whether it worked by chance or by practice, thus must have successful cases to support its being useful). A negative claim is a colloquialism for an affirmative claim that asserts the non-existence or exclusion of something.[10] The difference with a positive claim is that it takes only a single example to demonstrate such a positive assertion (\"there is a chair in this room,\" requires pointing to a single chair), while the inability to give examples demonstrates that the speaker has not yet found or noticed examples rather than demonstrates that no examples exist (the negative claim that a species is extinct may be disproved by a single surviving example or proven with omniscience). Ad hominem Doesn't a Latin just add, weight, to the credibility of what I'm going to say!?... hahaha... don't be fooled by it, just that don't be fooled by anything just because it is printed in a capital letter or on paper. Keep up your curiosity and hope you can still follow my lines so far. Ad hominem : refers to a fallacious argumentative strategy whereby genuine discussion of the topic at hand is avoided by instead attacking the character, motive, or other attribute of the person making the argument, or persons associated with the argument, rather than attacking the substance of the argument itself. Here we see the exact strategy (a fallacy) that B has deployed in this argument, by questioning Y's medical training — this is the most prevalent pattern you will observe in Chinese, both the online verbal assaults between a fan club and their foes, or historically how they tarnish someone during the Cultural Revolution era — once they prove you are a bad person (only in a moral sense, and the moral standard, of course, if held by the winner, usually the one who has the biggest fist or the loudest voice), they conclude that everything of you is now nonworthy! summary So now by examining the debate, there are two problems: On Y's part, he has to seek a different route to prove the negative. I don't know how and what it is, but there must be a way to do so. Otherwise, the negatives will be un-defeatible! On B's part, he attacked Y's credential instead of his claim, which is Ad hominem . Now, I'm interested in know, why there are so many argument fallacies in these common daily exchange of opinions? and how could people, who are not a student of philosophy, be able to guard themselves against them? Is there really a pattern that we can express the opinions freely, while not falling into these traps? And further, don't be an offender myself? Hmm......","tags":"thoughts","url":"https://fengxia41103.github.io/myblog/burden%20of%20proof.html"},{"title":"Heroes","text":"I have stated a thought on heroes in a previous article . However, after browsing the Wechat and saw all the posts of videos and articles on cities sending medical teams to Hubei or Wuhan on a heroic trip as if sending troops to the frontline, I have been thinking twice about this word — heroes. What are they? Are they commoners, who just got unlucky, caught by a moment of history, that his/her saying turned out to be a reality, thus they are now hailed as a prophet → a smaller figure of God, but a greater figure of human? Saw the news of Dr. Li's death yesterday was heartbreaking. I felt I wanted to say something, something nice about this person, something, showing off the bright side of me, that I care, that I'm angry at the reality, that I have a tender heart towards his tragedy .... but you see, everything I'm laying out here, starts with an \"I\". The news was all over the platform for exactly one day. One day! → Wechat is indeed a mirror of the modern Chinese mentality: short memory, short attention span, even for heroes ← Li never dreamed of his fate ending like this, not even when he sounded alarm , which at the time was nothing more than a personal opinion that was a fable voice among million of other loud shouts online — honestly, who cares!? who cared!? He was not a hero, and I truly wish he isn't one now, either, because being one is not fun — you don't choose to become one, you are made to become one. Why do people hail a hero? Do they really respect them? Admire them? Want to become them? So many would say, of course. But not really. Let's be honest w/ ourselves. Do you want to be a hero? Like Dr. Li? If given the opportunity of rolling back in time and swap him out w/ you, will you!? I won't, not if I know it's death waiting for me at the other end, in what, 20 days!? By setting up a statue of him, width:100%;all of us can now hide in the shadow of his figure, as if we are in line with his thinking and his doing, but is only to avoid facing our own cowardice, facing the reality of his actually not-so-inevitable fate, and facing to challenge the status quo, that, if perpetuated, will one day make one of us, another hero, in this same fashion ← we all know it is going to happen, just don't know who is going to win that lottery. We hail hero as if a tribe is chanting a song to their sacrifice, and lavishly slapping a crown of honor in their name only to justify our own guilt. What a shame! We need that shadow to cover us all, the larger, the better. To think of it, I don't want to be hero; I don't want anyone I know to become a hero; I don't want to run into a hero in my daily routine as they were becoming so many by being mass produced by a systematic method. No! I want to live in a place and time that commoners live their selfish lives and bicker over their daily nuances as their most agonizing experience, feel a broken heart from a breakup, struggle with daily chores or a terrible boss/job, live unhappily as these tiny little things annoy the hell out of them... but not any historical moment in book, whether from the past or from the future, that is said to witness the grandness of time, of achievement, of progress, of turning point, of achieving the unachievable, of proving us once more overcoming a surmount peril... no, none of these! Because grand era calls for great sacrifices, the one who actually moved the needle never knew s/he was making the history &mash they were caught by it, thus is a tragedy; the one who were the sacrifices, had been proven over and over and over again, would never bring rain, or peace, or God's favor, as planned. They are less than a tragedy; they are wasted by ignorance, by arrogance, by bureaucracy, by propaganda, by anything except your own will. What would I do if I were to send a group of people going to war, or to Wuhan? No camera. No flower. No crowd. Family and friends only, if they want to say farewell. I will watch them go by, if can be, one by one, as slow as it permits, and try to print down in my brain as much as I can, their faces, their voices, who they shaked hands, whom they hugged the longest time... Yes, bring a camera for that matter, so to remember all these — it is not a witness of glory, but a witness of incompetence and of shame, and I will watch over and over and over again, in private, only alone, so I could now cry, as hard as I can, as I owe them not only tears, but so much that I will never be able to compensate, to reconcile.","tags":"thoughts","url":"https://fengxia41103.github.io/myblog/heroes.html"},{"title":"Coronavirus","text":"The entire episode of 2020 Coronavirus is an ugly reality show. The poor Dr. Li died, and it's really sad, and ugly, an ugly truth that a hero was not born to be one; rather, they were becoming one by pure accident because they stepped forward, unknowingly, becoming out of line , standing out among the crowd, at the wrong time when a wave of collapse was to sweep through.... Li didn't foresee the scale of this epidemic; he is not a God. I don't believe anyone did, including the scolded Wuhan mayor who \"should have taken this more seriously\" — nonsense!! Li, practically speaking, is a hero not because of his prediction, but because of a mass sentiments brewing in the background who are so fed up by the official bureaucracy and its child-like reaction , that they need one spokeman, an icon, an image, to shout their minds in a safe distance — and when this hero is in past tense, so the more convenient. In the end, praising someone to be a hero is nothing but another move of cowardice, reminding me the line by Lyudmila Yevtushenko in the movie Battle for Sevastopol : \"I am 25 years old and I have killed 309 fascist invaders by now. Don't you think, gentlemen, that you have been hiding behind my back for too long?\" We, myself, and billion others, are only hiding behind hero's back. Not only so. To justify our feeble attempt, we, on the one hand, make an altar for our hero, putting their photos up high, as a sign of respect; on the other, we turn to the cause of the misery, not to scold its maker and feel disgusted by it, but instead, searching a justification in the pile of debris — that's when a glass bead is said to be as shining as a diamond, and is as worthy as one, too.","tags":"thoughts","url":"https://fengxia41103.github.io/myblog/coronavirus.html"},{"title":"Bucharest","text":"Luck to have this business trip and jumped on it at the last minute. Even luckier that I switched seat on the way here at the last moment, literally, when I found out I were going to seat next to someone I didn't want to entertain, and it worked out quite nicely ~~ Didn't know what to expect, except that I'm very much curious of the country and wanted to check it out. And the most impressive thing I found, people!! The people are just simply, beautiful, I mean, cosmetically, by their looks!! It's rather stunning that so many guys have grown big mustache, young and old, and boy, don't they have a style!! So many of them walking in that fancy mall next our office look like Beckham!! No kidding. And don't even get me started on girls — they are simply, gorgeous! Every one of them is like 6ft tall, long straight legs, beautiful beautiful hair, and the face! Oh, my, God! I took a random bus from Downtown yesterday after walking for so long and got really tired. So hopped on Route 335 which took me all the way to this giant mega mall, which is the perfect spot for people watching. And let me tell you, you walk around in the mall, and once a while, I mean, like every 30 seconds, you get a girl walking towards you or one you see in a distance, and honestly, my heart just skipped a beat !!! No kidding!! They are incredibly, goddess like!! And many many many of them have a really cool way to dress. Talking about 文艺青年， I bumped into a random street yesterday, and everyone I ran into, had this cool style, guys and girls, and the type of style looked, so natural on them, that I started to realize that this isn't really a style, per se, for them, but just their ordinary way of dressing — not fancy, because the whole country in general, is pretty poor, but because they possess such a tall body and cute face, that this style simply works. And buildings. I have never been other part of Europe, so have no reference. I have to say, the big block buildings, whether it's a Roman style, or Communist concrete squares, are just magnificent! The scale, the way it conveys its message, and the facades!!! I can't imagine how they can produce, and be willing to decorate all buildings, whether it's a palace, or a church, or just a residential place, w/ soooooo many facades!!!! So many!!! It's simply incredible how much extra work doing this must have added, all for, appealing the eyes!!! Bravo!! Really. I always say that you need to live a in beautiful place and surrounded by beautiful people and things, because it's like a training to your eyes and your mind — the look, the way, all become a part of yourself, even when you write code, not to mention, when you dress, when you buy clothes, when you look for a wife ~~ and this city has plenty beauty to offer, overwhelmingly so. I love it! Then, regardless so many nice looking buildings around, many many many of them, I'm talking about like streets and streets and streets of them, are in such a poor condition, that I didn't see a single soul living there! Most of the street level units are definitely not occupied at all — broken windows, boarded doors, graffeti everywhere!! I don't know how to describe this feeling when you were talking in them — it's like the entire city was in foreclosure, in a massive massive scale! It's simply mind boggling to witness how such a beautiful country/city are like this, when their beautiful women probably live in this, when they have such a potential, and if given a chance, they deserve so much more than what they have!! I don't know why so, I don't know whether a change is coming, or possible? I suppose everything is about politics, and there must be a reason these places are so not maintained. Nonetheless, I wish this country, and their people, a bright future, a wealthy economy, a comfortable life, so to match their good looking citizens. Really, sincerely. Went to check out the train station yesterday. It got me curious after the young guys in the team said that they would receive packages from home when they were in college, and every week !!!! According to them, there is no cafeteria, no place to cook, and the dorms are sooo darn cheap that they had to live off their mom's cooking sent by the train or bus via the conductors, every single week !! This felt literally, like a long military supply line, in peace time, for college kids!! How fascinating!! I wanted to check it out, and was genuinely expecting a large group of young looking college kids being there to pick up their stuff. But well, not exactly a large busy train terminals, more like the same size and look of Boston's commuter rails, almost the same size as the South Station, I would say. And get this, the only few trains I saw either departing or were waiting, had only 4 carriages!! It's really really short! and the platform? Was long!! Like designed for 30+ carriages, but the only thing running? 4. Hahaha.... interesting!? I don't know why, and I didn't really see any mass move of picking up packages kind of deal. Maybe it's Sunday? I don't know. I just found it rather unsustainable, right, that you, as a young hungry college person, would have to live off a long supply line from home, every week, or what? Starve to death? Man, that's something, isn't it! Then walking around from the train station, bumped right into a local grocery farmer's market, and picked up the best meal I had in Bucharest from an open BBQ stall — no one there speaks a word of english! Luckily a guy waiting in line was able to speak some, and he helped me to get my order in. It took me a bit hand wavings to order my wine (and Romanian word for it sounds like win !! Pretty close.). Sitting in this, plastic tents across to the BBQ grills, among a few tables of old local guys, the food felt incredibly delicious, and excellent!! For 25 Lei (the local currency of about 4:1 to USD), this is a treat ~~~ Later, two old guys walked in the tent, and couldn't find a seat to sit. So I waved them to join my table. There I was, sitting w/ two guys, whom I felt like walking off a Romanian movies — I don't know why, every single old man I saw here make me to think that he is a train conductor!!! hahaha... I guess that's the most frequent appeared roles in those Romanian WWII movies, you know, a white haired train conductor who is also an underground fighter.... it's just a very interesting feeling sitting there, watching them talking, they ignored me, and I didn't understand a word what they said.... actually, the guy sitting across me looked like a college professor in US, very cool looking I would say, for his age... sigh, if only I could get old looking like that... let's wish for it ~~","tags":"thoughts","url":"https://fengxia41103.github.io/myblog/bucharest.html"},{"title":"Beautiful voice","text":"What a beautiful song, and beautiful voices!

However hard it is, I need to do that, for you are a kite who should fly high, high high away. Your browser does not support the video tag. /* instead of the last line you could also add the flash player*/ It is a strange feeling. Waiting for the shuttle bus, and bumped into a new group of interns on their first day — young, fresh, lively, full of curiosity, expectation, and maybe hope. The sun shined through a girls hair, looking like threads w/ waving in the wind, bright, color of life. Woke up suddenly this morning. Last day of 2019, last day of staying w/ Dad, going home again. I missed you, very very much. Waking w/ a mind of you, don't remember now what you were doing in my dream, but it was you, and only you, could wake me like that. Wrote you a letter, maybe I will paste it here later. Sitting on the taxi coming over, music played a tune that, together with the car zipping through this city and the morning traffic, with the sun, the cold air, the strange silence in my heart, fit, like a movie scene. I almost cried, but it's ok, I felt you, felt myself leaving you, and that feeling ah, took all myself, away. I wished I could make my thoughts, all these thoughts of you, into a movie, someday, that I will play this music at this moment, that I'm letting it go, finally, letting it go, I can't hold on to you any longer, if indeed you were a kite, now I am cutting the string... fly, fly, my love, fly, but remember, I'm here, and when you are tired, when you are hurt, come back, I'm here, I'll make you laugh, will heal your wound, and you can fly out again.

That's exactly how I felt when I was doing that ~~ But then, it isn't a privilege a king has, right, I mean, you could just get a stool, and sit by a curb in a city, and watch people going by like that also.. But there is sth about airport, you can see how much effort a woman puts in — the dress, the shoes, the accessories, the air she puts on, essentially, the image she is trying to leave to all these strangers around her, interesting! This makes me wonder, that being a super model must be extremely, uncomfortable — after all, I think nobody in his/her common sense will/should comfortable walking in front of some eyes whose sole purpose is to watch him/her walking by, and on top of all these, the models have to wear, well, nearly nothing, sometimes, and that must take quite some guts to do so, and don't feel bad about him/her-self! I don't know, maybe that's why super models all have low self-esteem, and little self-confidence? So, no one is like to be watched, or judged, even though, everyone knows, we are being judged, being scrutinized, being compared, being watched, being always a person in others' eyes, isn't this an irony!? I like the ones who have nothing to pretend, but wearing the same stuff that you can tell belongs to him/her, and sometimes even a bit out of scene that they drag on a few things which don't belong to the glass windows, granite floors, attendants in uniforms, but then, they were just minding their own business, trying to figure out their ways, in this confusing place — it is indeed a confusing place, everytime I travel, I have to feel, anxious, feel uneasy, feel, uncertain. Maybe it's just the crowd that makes me, nervous. Or, maybe, it's just the feeling of leaving, leaving a place, again, that makes me, a bit, sentimental. I finally figured out, about travels — I don't think I will like it at all, not when it lasts over, say, a month ← there are a lot to take care of if you are hopping from city to city — transportation, lodging, food, maybe a few places you overhear and want to visit now, or a thing you saw in a store that you want to carry w/ you, but then, thinking about how many stops you still have, and the luggage you have to drag along, that you let it go in the end — I think only when travels are all arranged, that you will find it, enjoyable, maybe. But then, doesn't it defeat the purpose of travel altogether!? I think so. It is the uncertainty, the get away, that makes a travel, interesting, not a fixed schedule, a known agenda, a sure plan. But hopping on the road at a random will is a bit, demanding. I liked it, not because it was fun, but I had a place in mind, which I have to go, and see. To me, it's not a travel, a trip, but rather, is the only way, to settle, with myself.","tags":"thoughts","url":"https://fengxia41103.github.io/myblog/airport.html"},{"title":"Late night, city","text":"When was the last time I was sitting by a window watching a city going to sleep? Was it 2012 when I took Noah to Japan for the first time, that I was sitting there, watching the city sleep, watching the city wake up? Then, I was writing emails to Noah's mom, hoping the words will get to her. But then, they never get responses, so the story ended, w/ a sad ending, as expected. Now, I'm sitting at a window again, watching the city lights going out here and there, less noise on the street, less cars going by, and families of the building next become dark as ppl are also turning off lights at home to go to sleep — so here I am, ready to fly again tomorrow, but sitting here, watching, writing, thinking. I tried to feel you these days, but honestly, after spending time in your city, I started to feel, less now of the memories — I still wish you could be next to me, someday, but I can't feel what is like anymore, just a thought, less emotional now, at least for now, it is so. Sitting at a square nearby in the evening and watched people square dance. Fascinating. Especially there was this woman, can't see her face, all dressed up, in a really elegant way, just standing there, still, and her (I guess) boyfriend who has a beer belly, was leading a group of enthusiasts, dance to a loud tune. Can't really say he dances well; but she looks quite striking from behind, especially in the middle of these loudness, dim lights, and happy hours. There was a large circle, probably 50 people or even more, some dressed in what I would guess 彝族 costumes, moving in one direction w/ rhythmic kicks, beats, and some singings. Watching them going by as if they were gathering around a bonfire at their village, I couldn't help feeling touched by the rough spirits they possessed, however unpolished it may be, it was down to earth, plain, and touching. Looking at their faces and attires, I can't tell what they do during day, or whether they are really 彝族, or they were just having a good time. Was it a dating theme, that they were checking each other out? Or just a chance to grab a stranger's hands, or being nudged to each other w/o feeling embarrassed or annoyed? was it, their form of a, hug? Maybe so, maybe so. Whatever it is, it is a human need, that everyone wants to feel close to someone, wants to jump and kick and sweat, wants to sing and dance, wants to beat to a beat, wants to feel, real, alive — there it goes, a middle age guy was just invited by his friend to join the dance circle, immediately he was mixing into the same move like everybody else! How interesting! Apparently he is not new to this, but then, when he was just standing next to me, I would never tell! So I watched, watched, not that the music was pleasing, but there were people in it, and like a place, people, give it, a soul. Went back to the boutique coffee shop tonight after a full dinner, feeling I wanted to pay it another visit before leaving town tomorrow. However, it's was rather a disappointing experience — so there were these two women ahead of me, who got their fancy coffee also, and they started doing some kind of astrology-kind show while I was waiting for mine — one apparently was a main speaker, whose topic of the night was number 7, and she just started talking talking, \"people whose number 7 is detail oriented, curious, and lucky.....\" I turned around to check her out, since she was quite fluent, I thought she might be reading something, but no, she was just talking to her phone! So it got me quite annoyed, that her head actually has this kind of stuff coming out naturally.... and the worst part, is the other woman smoked while I was served my coffee, so not only I dont like smoke, but that it masked my coffee taste.. sigh. I wanted to say something to them, but then, well, I'd better be a stranger, and let them do what they do, cause I really don't want to ask further their topic, or their interests in coming to this shop — if you were here for coffee, I'm sure you didn't appreciate the air that used to be mixed w/ coffee bean smell and chocolate, but now, there was nothing but a cigarette smell. What a bad idea! Walked to the bookstore I found. Quite a nice place. Yes there were also young girls and guys taking photos (girls are taking poses, while one guy is shining lights using his phone, and another w/ a big ass lens and camera). Pretty bogus, isn't it!? It's ok. They need this setting, so to prove how cool they are, how cultural they are — however one doesn't like read books at all, books printed on paper, sitting on shelves, still spell out a status no other shining goodies can compete — same as the rudimentary music the square dances had, books, as plain as they are, touches a person, a mysterious power, isn't it? I don't know you will ever be here, in this store, or taking that coffee. I'm sure you have seen much better ones. But it's ok. These are just places, moments, thoughts, that make me think of you, even though you were not here — when I felt sad, felt moved, felt happy, felt forgotten, felt alone, I always wished, you would know.","tags":"thoughts","url":"https://fengxia41103.github.io/myblog/late%20night%20city.html"},{"title":"Mask, and random clips","text":"I wonder, whether human feels deep inside an urge, to hide behind a mask, some sort of shield , so to feel, safe, feel privileged among peers, feel self-confident? If you notice, the premium spot of any coffee shop, is always the big glass window facing outside, while you can sip your coffee, or just sit there idling, while people watching, and while, maybe, be watched by people going by. Why so? Why do we want to hide behind a glass shield? From the inside, it feels that you are outside this world looking in; but standing outside, don't you also become a fish in a tank, quite pathetic in a box feeling good about yourself? I don't know, but I find it to be very much true, to myself, as well as to many many others ← we like to sit by the window, to watch people, and to be watched, and the drink, the price tag, the environment, all become something standing behind me, so to make me feel, above the ones outside — and even so, that me having the luxury to sit down, to relax, to kill time, while people walking by, well, are, walking, are occupied physically, so that adds another layer of icing on the peer victory, doesn't it!? How interesting! Then, along this line, all of sudden you start to find a lot of masks. Another common one besides glass window: sunglass — wearing sunglass is always more than functional — you feel, somehow, safe, behind these shades, even though they hide nothing but some eyes, while 99% of your body is exposed, but you think you are different, invisible — in a sense, the eyes don't have direct contact, thus others can't just peek into your soul, but well, how many people really read others' eyes? or even pay attention to!? Then, if you wear sunglass inside a Starbucks, that's like double shields, isn't it? Bonus! Walked quite a bit after dinner along a, river? creek?, which led me all the way to this fancy shopping mall called Kunming Square. I got tired walking after a few stores, then just leaning aginst rail on the 2nd floor, and watching people for a while. To my disppointement, girls in this city aren't really stylish, nor attractive — they do have a style, sort of Japanese, pretty cute, but they lack, the move, which I can't describe what it is — they wear a cute clothes, but don't feel comfortable in it, just a feeling. You, on the other hand, has a style, that is very, cool... well, everything about you is cool anyway ~~ Sitting in MUJI to take a breath, I started to look at people wondering the store — have you done that before? If not, I strongly encourage you try it next time, just watch, watch them scan shelves, as if deep in thoughts. What is it, I wonder!? I think everyone, myself included, is just looking for something in the store that is, affordable, catching the eyes (secondary, really), so s/he is convincing him/her-self that \"Yes we can buy this one, It's cute, and reasonably priced.... \" But honestly, I don't feel anything there is reasonably priced, not even the Uniqlo across the isle! ← sadly, I can't even affort Uniqlo these days anymore.. but then, why do people shop so to convince themselves in this way!? Just about 90% of the stuff in the store I have no clue what they should be — I mean, I know what they do, but why are they priced as such? Style itself doesn't justify, in most cases → it justifies a shirt or a dress, but it doesn't, simply doesn't, justify a dust pan, or a storage box!! I'm sorry, I'm not getting it... but then, apparently this is shopping all about — we seldomly have a particularly thing in mind to buy, we just wonder around, scan and scan and scan (and I find processing that much information quite tiring actually!), and trying to convine yourself \"that one is not bad.. this one is good\", and so on. So while sitting there and watching these, I wonder, the only reason we do so, is to make yourself fit in, to be seen as someone who knows these stuff, whose life is filled w/, or associated w/, this type of stuff. It isn't just a status symbol, but rather, is a psychological treatment, to make ourselves believe, our lives are somehow overlapping w/ the lives these stores are projecting. Watching these people in the store actually reminds me a video clip I saw once, that the first scene is a disco night club where all sort of people were dancing to the loud music, body moves, heads shake, spirits high; then, the 2nd scene, th exact same clip, but no music anymore, just people — they moved, then became, rather awkward, so stopped at the end, dispersed.... Watching these people in Muji, or in Mall in general, reminds me this scene — they actually look quite, strange, each w/ a sort of serious look on their faces, deep in thoughts, appearing to be focused, but to me, deep inside, all I said to myself was, \"fxxxk it, this is fxxxking expansive, ridiculous, who the hell buys this stuff, what a rip off....\" Sigh, am I just an old fxxxk now? I start to lose interest and the fun of window shopping, which I used to LOVE! Sad sad sad. But honestly, try it yourself next time, stand outside yourself, or just watch other people doing that, you will see what I mean — so shopping, in these fancy places, is just another mask we put on — we try to transform ourselves into this pretty setting, grabbing something sort of expansive, but not quite killing ourselves, and that, feels good ~~ You know what is real life, and when you see all the girls in the neighbourhood in the open, almost in herds!? That's when I walked into this filthy, smelly, back alley open grocery market this evening, and saw quite a few young women buying groceries — they shouldn't be doing this, really, by the look and by the dress — they should have been living a princess life, loved and treasured by someone, kept away from these chores, shielded from the unsightful side of life. But then, this is real, this is a cruel side of life... cruel. Bumped into a small book store in the middle of this artificial pedestrian biz district. I usually don't like such settings at all. This one is, ok, because they sell some old books, which I found interesting, and the best part of it is, there was nearly no people there! and no sound, no music, just open windows, golden leaves falling once a while caught by a gush of breeze, shelves of books, B&W photos of authors & thinkers on the wall along the top of shelves, whom I hardly know any except Bernard Russel, but I liked looking at them — well, it isn't that much different from many other boutique bookstores I have been. But I liked this one, not because it was cool or unique, just a feeling, a mood, perhaps, that I'm tired now, I want to sit on that little stool, just sit there, half squat, and breathe. 来, 歇歇脚，就是这样，就是这样，就是这样.","tags":"thoughts","url":"https://fengxia41103.github.io/myblog/mask.html"},{"title":"Be nice","text":"Can we be nice? Can we be nice to, strangers? Can we be nice strangers? Coming downstairs to grab a bottom water from a nearby convenient store. There was a little girl w/ her mom, probably 8 years old, walking in front of me, and she went out the build door first, then held it open for two other girls behind them, then me. I thanks her for being so kind. But, they walked behind me in the same direction to the store, and the mom just wasn't happy at all, \"Aren't u stupid!? Why did you do that!? They got hands, too, you know!? Why did you do that!?.... \" So it went on and on and on... what's wrong w/ these people!? I couldn't take it anymore. I turned around, thanks the girl again, and said to the mom \"She did a good thing, you know? You should give her a compliment.\" I also wanted to refute her of her idea of \"they also get hands\" line — well, technically, just about everyone except a few unfortunates have hands, legs, (brain? cough cough...), but it isn't a reason that we should be kind by holding door for the person behind, is it!? I don't get it, really. I actually thought China has improved quite a bit this time from what I witnessed. For one, cars are now forced to yield to pedestrians! That is really nice! But then, once a while, I can still feel the strange look when I'm being nice to a stranger, or myself being a nice stranger. Why? If the girl is to grow up under her mom's ideas, well well, I'm pretty sure she won't be a nice person as she is right now, and, I would even speculate that her mom, by her comments on this event, isn't nice at all, and is not deserved to receive a kind gesture either... well, this is a bit too harsh. Let me take this back. I disagree her comments on her daughter's kind gesture, that's all. Went to a mall today. Oh My God, do u know how big it is!? It's enormous!! I guess it's like 10 football fields combined, isles and isles of stuff, a lot of stuff, and a lot of the same stuff... it's just massive, and super tiring! People literally ride bikes in it, or on the segway! Walking from end to end is like 2 miles long at least, and each floor has like 16 of them!! Then there are 5 floors, nearly all filled!! Oh mine, I have never seen such scale before, simply mind boggling! Searched for the canvas bags I want, but didn't find any, too bad. It's not in fashion, I suppose. Got a old looking oil paper umbrella that I have always dreamed about!!! Awesome!! Though it has some drawings on it (two styles, one w/ a dragon and a phoenix, one w/ a white crane), it's ok. I joked the one dragon-phoenix one is either for a king or a 太监, and the crane, though means long life, makes me feel like a wish to die, haha. So I got a dragon-phoenix one. Now, let's pray for some rain ~~ Got super frustrated over work tonight. Shifting branches is creating a nightmare, but that's technical and I can handle that. But what pisses me off is that no one is giving me a straight answer — I emailed my opinion and raised concerns, and sometimes just a straight yes/no question. Guess what!? They continued on what they were doing, as if my concern had no effect, and for an email to question a merged request \"Did I miss some information on this?\" I got is \"we will discuss\". Fxxx that. I want a straight answer, not \"we will discuss\", so I can have info to do my job properly. This is very screwy. I won't bother till all shits hit the fans, and I'm back in the office again, that I think I will have some serious, unpleasant conversation w/ some folks regarding this project, and probably to ask them to remove me from this project entirely ← I'm getting really fed up now.","tags":"thoughts","url":"https://fengxia41103.github.io/myblog/be%20nice.html"},{"title":"To Be Discovered","text":"Does everyone has talent? With popularity of the smart phone, all of sudden, everyone is now a photographer, generating tons of photos, and some of them are actually quite pleasing. Why do they post them in wechat? To get attention? compliment? or, just that, they think they have a hidden talent, thus waiting to be discovered? We have heard the cliche that 千里马常有，而伯乐不常有. Once upon a time I was thinking the same thing of myself. But now, I wonder, whether it's truly so? Thinking of you this morning, while reading the blogs I wrote over this year. I wish I could share them w/ you somehow, and wonder how you would feel reading them. But then, I had to remind myself that girls are usually a lot more practical than guys at the same moment, that the decisions they make are actually quite advanced, just that guys didn't understand. If looking at them as a bystander, I have to agree w/ the girls — and also, that the guys in the same scene were usually so immature and clueless that it is rather pathetic. But, does it also apply to myself? Is it why I felt so stuck at the emotion in those blogs, while the reality has been that I was just clueless and immature, thus making it even more right for you to 断舍 离? (but honestly, I dislike this word at all! not only because it hurt me, but that it felt rather bogus and like an execuse — if one were to 断，it doesn't mean s/he would have to leave离, or give in. 断is not to continue on the same path as it were, but this person could still be in your life). Anyway. Ran into a teeny tiny coffee shop yesterday. What an interesting setup! It can seat, 3 ppl? Dim lights, not because they wanted the mood, but the space is so small and caved in, that it simply has little natural lights. The space was jammed w/ all kinds of handwritten notes mixed w/ English, mostly about the business itself, introduction of coffee beans, and a cool stereo setup that played some rather strange music after I asked them to play some music. The music made the space a bit, time traveling, I would say. It was soo dim that hardly any of my photos came out well. But it's ok. The owner is a really cool guy — just about everything he has, from a handmade apron to his tiny water kettle, measure cups, brew gears, grinders, some small arts here and there on his home made shelf and walls, a stack of old books half the height of the only window in the room, piles of beans in its linen bags on a pallet, two canvas bags on top — one has his diving gears, and another is a travel duffle bag, a tennis bag, a guitar, and music and chocolate and coffee bean smells in the air, and a woman who claimed herself to be his wife (but she looks unfamiliar with this setting, rather like a visitor, like myself).... impressive. This makes me wonder, whether the purpose of travel, or the fruit of travel, is to discover these places, these people? But I don't know. Rather, I would agree w/ 陈涤's comment, though it felt a bit like a universal truth, that travel to a place is to reconcile — to reconcile w/ yourself, w/ this world, w/ this life, w/ the person you love/hate, w/ the matter you care/want-to-ignore, w/ your own past and your inevitable next day. If you happen to be in a place like this coffee shop, maybe it is fateful, also, that such things make you stay, to take a break, to relax, to enjoy, and to discover beauty again. I liked the coffee, not because it was charming, but it left a taste lingering for a while — it was bitter, but settling, makes me think of you — you may make me sad, but you make me, real.","tags":"thoughts","url":"https://fengxia41103.github.io/myblog/to%20be%20discovered.html"},{"title":"What is love","text":"What is it? I have written so much about this word, and have been thinking so hard about what it is, but not until a few days ago, in the evening, by the sunset, watching geese and ducks going home, w/ a mountains far far away, no sound but the sound of ordinary country life, when the old guy next door walking to his old lady, pulled out his hand w/ some sunflower seeds, she reached out, w/ a big smile, took them, and they stood side by side, just like, w/ all the wrinkles testifying their identity and their tough life. Yet, they smiled, they chatted, they were next to each other, in an arm's length, everyday, every evening — to them, this is not love, it's life itself — you don't label it w/ such exotic word, you simply live it. I asked the lady what she calls her Mr., \"阿哥（gu er）\", she smiled, a bigger smile, on her face, when she was saying the words, 阿哥, so sweet, so, sweet. \"What does he call you?\" I was expecting 阿妹. She smiled again, a shy smile, at age 72, can't you be sweeter than, this!? \"He doesn't call me anything. He calls me by name... we call each other by names\", so she said. But here he was, pulling out a small gift he probably just picked up from somewhere, or just found from his pocket, he gives them to her, as if it were a given, and that, is what love is — it's plain, warm, and touching.","tags":"thoughts","url":"https://fengxia41103.github.io/myblog/what%20is%20love.html"},{"title":"Musicians","text":"Never thought there are so many musicians in this tiny little city. But honestly, the first couple tunes got me — so genuine, touching, original. I like music, but I don't think music means the same to me as to this person — the music came from his inside, he felt it when he played, he was the music, and the music gave peace to him. Met your uncle again tonight. He is a really cool guy. I was very much surprised that he gave his diary (this is my understanding) to this young guy whom he was taking in as hist very first student. That's quite, bold, I would say. I'm curious what he has written in it. But on the other hand, he showed quite well himself in this move and in the little poem he wrote — I felt he is in some kind of mood, don't know what it is, that he decided to take in a student, but also felt a bit awkwardness, I guess, thus saying that hoping he would be able to be a good teacher for three days — is this because he is not confident of himself, that he is subject to a change constantly? or that he is always doing and saying such things in such occasion in order to be a well rounded person? I don't know him enough to tell. Nonetheless, it was nice to have a chat w/ him, a legend I only learned from you, and while chatting, I constantly looked for a trace to feel, fearful , as you have told me once, that you feel afraid of him sometimes. But I can't see much of it, maybe some, not much — he is ok, he has seen much things, done much things, I feel maybe the age is catching up w/ him also, that he is not as confident as he was before anymore, and he started to reflect him life, seeking what is really important, what is just vain. This is just my guess, but a feeling I had while looking at him — unlike your grandpa, whose eyes sparked w/ a youth, wit, and fearlessness, your uncle's had something uncertain in it. Watching him playing guitar is quite nice. However, I can't help wondering whether he is still feeling, happy, by playing. Is he? He appeared to be high, to be happy, to be in the mood, but only in a few moments I felt he was in it. In other times, I felt he was trying, but the word trying exactly made me wonder that deep inside, he is not as happy and excited as he shows. I really don't know him much at all, so this is just rootless speculation. Anyway, I find him a fine person to be with, maybe having some habits and lingos picked up from his life in Beijing, so to be viewed as a sign of coolness. Behind all these, he is a thoughtful person, maybe even an angry person — I don't feel a mind of peace in his play, nor a sense of losing-yourself in the moment, but an endeavor, an effort, and that, makes me feel a bit sad about him, actually. Mr. Zhuang, the musician , on the other hand, is just incredibly, musical — his play is just, incredible! I can't say how it touches it, but it will, trust me, it will. Like human sadness, a genuine feeling is contiguous, is universal, and when you see it, you feel it, like a dagger piercing your heart — pain, sharp, real. That's his music, that's his person, that's his songs — pain, sharp, real. I can imagine his limitation which probably hindered his success. But like everyone else, the weakness is also his strength — exactly because such, personality/traits, that his music has the power to get into you — is it echoing the same feelings inside me, that I'm relating myself to him, thus making his music powerful? Likely, though I don't want to admit. Had a early morning chat w/ her after all the guests had left last night. I almost had the moment to tell her why I'm here, but I held back. I need a person to speak to, but telling her will inevitably complicate things, maybe even shocking to her, I'm afraid. I only planned a trip to be here, so that I could see a place you were at, a little place you might be someday. Yet, fate, truly, fate, surprised me to a million degrees this time. The moment I stepped into the courtyard that night, I didn't even know who she is. But in the last few days I met all the people you had mentioned to me before, especially grandpa — I never know, never expected I would ever meet him in person (same is true to your uncle also), but what an odds! Not only I saw him, but I sat next to him, listened to him, saw the place/room you were probably putting up the 窗花 before, and probably will soon for the new year, (and his photo, the moment he showed me that, I felt I have seen it before, and I probably have, can't recall it for sure, but you may have showed me this at some point, oh mine mine mine, memory, memory, I felt I was losing my mind, I didn't know what to think anymore) — yes, I'm here, as close to you as I never dreamed; yet, you are like a dream to me now, once waking up, there is only a slim sense of memory, however sweet it was, it's no where to be found anymore..... 汤 took some photos of me, and posted them. I don't know whether you see them, whether you would resent me being here, or thinking that I had planned all these just to jam myself again into your life. My dear, please trust me, I didn't, I would never — I came here, because I wanted to send your Birthday bless from here, from a place that meant something to you, that's all. I wanted to see this place, wanted to be a place that one day, it will see your footsteps again, that you might hear people talking there was a guy from America who traveled far far away to find this place, and he was a nice person — I wished that you will raise your head from the wechat, listened to the conversation, and wondered who this person might be. That's all I wished for, though I got too much more this time, way too much more. But my dear, I am here, I was here, for, I miss you, so much.","tags":"thoughts","url":"https://fengxia41103.github.io/myblog/musicians.html"},{"title":"Funeral","text":"From a photo book, \"五彩凉山\", 2005 by 韩达华， found in 楠院，会理 Human emotion, are the same. Regardless gender, race, poverty, wealth, where you are from, what you have been, what you are, emotions, are the same — when you are happy, you laugh; when you are sad, you cry. I can't help crying over this picture. Picked it up off the book shelf in 楠院, out of nowhere, here it is, a picture I truely feel the emotion, that when you loved ones are leaving, how can't you not feeling sad!? how can't you not feeling loneliness!? how can't you, not cry!? I have always felt that there is something about human's sadness, that it's such a powerful, contiguous feeling, that if you are truly a person that has not yet died inside, you will feel it, you will, as if the event is happening to yourself, that it is really not something external, strange to you, but part of you, part of your life. Strange? No. Precious. Only by being able to feel the others', that I think it makes one person a true person — only w/ the emotion, however it is, it tells myself that, yes, I can still feel, I can still love. I can't be w/ you anymore. It's ok. Sitting in this court yard, bathing in this winter warmth, I'm feeling the closest to you, to where you have been, to where you might be, someday. Yet, I know I'm leaving this place, and leaving all the good days behind. I don't know I will ever step into this town, into this city, into this area. But my dear, believe me, I left a lot here, left them in the air, in the sun ray, in the echos of the geeses, in the profile of the mountains, in the breeze that brushes over the leaves, in the pond w/ the little fish, in the fire and smoke at night, in the pebbles I stepped on, in the dust I cleaned and wishing, that someday, when you are here, they might tell you, that one day, there was a person, who travelled far far far away to here, cleaned up this place as if he were expecting a guest. Yes, it was me, and I did all these, because, I so wished, you would be here, as a guest, one day.","tags":"thoughts","url":"https://fengxia41103.github.io/myblog/funeral.html"},{"title":"Run into","text":"What an interesting trip so far! The host wants to take me to the old town, which I initially thought would be a rather boring trip since I don't really have much interest in the tourist stuff this time. Yet, guess whom we ran into!? Your uncle. What an odds! She is a famous person, apparently, in this little town, that just about everywhere we went, there was someone who was nodding to her, coming to her to chat, and smiled at her. And she had to stop often to catch up w/ her old friends and so on. Yet, completly unexpected, we ran into him by the foot of the old city gate. Now watching the tiny entrance to this new what I would call a private club, I suddenly realized who he is, because the name of it rings a bell — I think you mentioned to me before. Yes, so here he is, sitting across to me, quite an interesting, and different person, than I pictured — he is very, real. I don't think he is intimidating at all. Maybe he is. Maybe it's just because we had such a short overlap, that all the politeness was enough to get by for such a short time, and by touring us the little space he is making, there was also enough topics to talk about, and enough opportunity to make it pleasant. The space is quite, nice, small, cozy, full of, his thoughts. I like it. Not because it is quite an exquisite place, but that he appears to be a very thoughtful person. Unlike the successful ego-centric people I have come to know and disgusted in China, he is quite, real — he is full of his own thoughts, and I have to say I agree w/ most of them, not because they are in sync with mine, but that I respect the process behind getting these thoughts — unlike a superficial millionaire, his mind is actively seeking to think over these thoughts, to come to a term w/ himself. So it doesn't really matter what it is, as long as it is original, genuine, and sincere, which I think his words, are. I tried hard to find a trace on his face of arrogance, of superiority, some, not much. Then, his look reminds me very much of, you — maybe it is the family look you have inherited, the good looking profile, and sharpness behind bright eyes, the eloquence of expression which only comes from the self, not another common cliche copied from pop talks and books. Yes, that is also, you. You may not yet think this way, but I bet you will, someday, maybe sitting here in this same court yard, sipping coffee (I think you will take coffee over tea ← my prediction ~~), bathing the sun, reflecting the days you have had. Maybe then, you may recall a person, who has passed your life. Will you then feel that I have been here? I have also taken the coffee, had the chat, the wall, the tiles, the white washed rooms, the large windows inviting abundant sunshine into the room, the one lonely soul who has come all these way to breathe this air, to see this town (but honestly, never expected I would meet any of the people I have met so far), just to be close, to you. I don't know you ever will. Maybe it's better that way. Just like a passing star, I ran across the sky, not to disturb or bother, but only to leave a trace in the sky, in life, far far far away, don't know ever it will pass again, don't know ever you have ever caught the light, don't know ever you will ever know I have been here... But yes, my dearest sunshine, I came, I'm here, I want to see you, even only there is a wall brick you have touched, I put my hands on it, I tell myself, here, there is you, as beautiful as a creator can ever make, as wonderful as a being can ever become, as delicate as the 三角梅 that was growing there, as real, as close, as warm. I tried million times, to move on, to forget, to let go. The evening breeze, the village noise in the background, the faint smell of smoke and food, the mountains w/ its gray outlines in the distance, the black tiles and white walls that looks both serene and old, none of these, makes it easier — I dreamed you sitting on the small stool next to me, listenning to my tune, or reading this one day, if only.... I'll leave this fate now. I tried, I did. Happy birthday again. Be happy, sweet dreams.

Yet, sitting there among all the old men who were playing Mahjiong or pokers, I felt, old, felt, irrelevant, felt, sad. I wanted to write something, I did, but the words didn't carry how I felt. I smiled, chatted w/ the old woman who was attending the tables, had a good time listening to her life and her stories, and yet, I felt, void, inside. Was it because of the shade that there was no sun but only a clear day? was it because the lights were getting dim towards the end of day when I sat down? was it because I waited too long for my noodle to come, thus getting frustrated? or, was it because, this is a city of you, and yet, I couldn't imagine how it would ever be like sitting here, w/ you aside? Will you like this setting? this type of life? Will you join me, if I get this old and do what these people do? or, will you just let me sit here, alone, as I was doing then? Will you feel anything if I told you I'm here, just to be close to you? I don't know where this place, I liked it, liked the wall arts (which is quite amazing!), like the people who spent their entire day strolling up and down the street, or just sitting here sipping their tea and watching a game others play — I don't know what they get out of it by watching, but they enjoy, they don't even mind standing there for a long time, just standing there, watching, how interesting! Will you like this? I think you will, when you are tired of walking, of pursuing the things that are vain and empty, of running your brain 24 hours a day on some difficult problems, of being stressed by ignorant or arrogant people and their illogical decision, of being anyone but yourself, as if you are drifting, alone, among thousands of other fall leaves, falling, and beautiful. Maybe. Maybe, one day, you will be sitting here, in this alley, at this table, on this chair. Maybe, you will be chatting w/ this woman who is still here, and she mentions years back there was a guy from Beijing, sitting here, chatting w/ her, saying goodbye when he left, wishing to see her again, and, that would put a smile on her face — though, she doesn't know, I was there, only to feel, this city, this life, this place, that in my imagination, is what you used to be — hearing kids shouting and laughing behind the their campus walls just by the alley, mixed w/ a few bare light bulbs on each table for the light, so, it is night, so, I am here, in this mega city, in this corner of the city, in this grayness of a winter evening, missing you. Tomorrow, I'll be on the road again, a long long bus ride which is almost the same length from the States to China. I don't know how well I will fare. But no matter. This is a place I want to see, a place I want to be, on this day, no matter how far it is, how hard the trip will be, I'll be there. It's funny that twice in my life I made a trip to this part of the country — unexpected, fateful. So it is.","tags":"thoughts","url":"https://fengxia41103.github.io/myblog/tea%20alley.html"},{"title":"Revisit","text":"For the first time in this trip that I can feel the time is finally, all mine, that I can now plan for things I wanted to do, and see people I wanted to see. Revisiting seems to be the theme of this trip — seeing old friends whom I haven't talked to face to face for years, some I have been thinking to say something to but don't know when or ever. Finally, I saw them all, talked to them all, visited places I always felt I should in case I'm gone the next day. Less regrets, more peace of mind, like paying back a debt, though the debt is only on one's emotion, nonetheless it is there, often emerges into my mind, calling me to settle it, someday, and that someday has finally, realized. The feeling after seeing all of them is rather, mixed. To some I can feel the closeness, that our paths though have come apart, our minds are still close; to some I feel the distance — our lives have all moved on, and the context we are living in are so different now that there is hardly anything to talk except relating the good old days, but not much we can all see laying ahead of us. It will only be fewer and fewer overlaps from now on, sad, isn't it? Walking in the hotel room at Wanda suddenly reminds me the times Noah was w/ me. I don't even remember now how many days we stayed here, nor he went downstairs to the swimming pool or not. Just the settings in the room is identical as what I remembered, making even think that this is the same room number we had. How old was he? 3? 4? He was little! I watched kids on the street who are about that age, how cute are they! and how small are they!! I can't recall such conclusion when he was that old, I'm sure he could only have been more cute, more adorable than all the ones I saw, and yet, I only recall how stressful the days were — I don't know whether I'm still depressed, maybe, I'm pessimistic these days for sure, not because I'm angry at my own life, but that I'm too annoyed by the BS floating around, the lies, the say-one-thing-but-do-another people. Too many of them, too many. Taiyuan is indeed a homey city. It looks pretty bad, but it feels full of ordinary people, ordinary life. Walking by a small street grocery market last night, really sad looking stalls and materials. Yet, customers don't seem to mind, they bargain, they purchase, they sell, they live their lives. You know, one thing I start to find different in this trip is that I become understanding of many things in China which I used to view as annoyance — not only I see, but I feel, that lives here are quite different, that people live differently, and many live, poorly, but they don't have a choice, they have to get by 24 hours a day just like me, so when I see them on the street, by such small market, I used to see disgust, poverty, misery, now I see courage, bravery, spirit ! Life is hard. The one who can still hold his head high deserves respect, don't you think? Flying out today to Chengdu, the city that will get me closer to, your home town. Like a petty thief who walks on a street w/ a stolen treasure in his pocket, I'm moving closer and closer to the place you lived once with growing anxiety and excitement. I don't know where you are about anymore, nor knowing whether you are even willing to be bothered by all these writings. I don't dare now to reach for a word or a sound from you, and I don't wish to let you see me again since I'm becoming old and ugly. But my dear, I can't yet cut the link in my heart, so I have to find another way to make the tie, w/ you, if not a future, then the past, a past I will go as far as I could, to find you.","tags":"thoughts","url":"https://fengxia41103.github.io/myblog/revisit.html"},{"title":"Indirection","text":"I wonder whether the Chinese people have been used to reading, indirectly — so I was sitting on a cab going to the train station this morning, and the driver had a music playing w/ a title \"30% of love and 70% of lie\" (what a title, btw!) It's rather unexpected and I asked him to play the song for me, nothing special, just another those pop song that drivers and ppl who do labor works like to hear, but the title caught my interest. So for a long time since last time I took a picture of it and posted in my wechat, w/ some comments of love that whatever you do or think about love, just don't lie, really, love is such a pure and beautiful thing, is such a rare occasion in life, to put a lie into it is just, wrong. But guess what!? Overwhelmingly the responses I received is all about that inquiry whether I'm now back in China — at the beginning I felt rather annoyed by these, that it wasn't my intention to use such a way to announce my arrival/departure (as a matter of fact, I have been in Shanghai w/ mom for over 10 days now, caught a terrible cold and cough all these time, finally feeling better, thus having such a thought when seeing the song title), and we are about to leave Shanghai for Beijing as her annual migration route (and to think of this, this is rather, reversed, don't u think — that birds migrate from cold areas to somewhere warm, and hers is the other way around, well, so her!), so this so called a moment is certainly not an arrival for me. But then, it got me thinking — why? why so? why do they all catch the meaning as if I'm using this picture and comment to make such an impression that I'm subtly telling everybody that here I am, I'm back again!? I think they are just so used to interpret a meaning out of anything, as if every word heard carries a hidden message, and they do and say and act in the same fashion also — words don't carry a face value, and they bury their true intention deep hoping that they will be discovered/understood! But why!? Isn't this the root cause of misunderstanding? When I was writing it I had no intention of any sort of what they thought it was, and yet, the response was uniform. So even for someone like me who doesn't share their train of thought, their logic or reasoning, inevitably, they could only react using the way they know ← isn't this because the society they live in is full of such things!? I have discussed this much in euphemism , but my conclusion is the same after two years, that such communication pattern is not only pointless, but is outwright harmful — we are already having too much trouble making oneself understood, understanding others, being able to reach an agreement w/ both parties knowing exactly what the deal is, and here, everyone, out of their life habit, is only able to read a line and respond by finding the indirect meaning of a line ← I do give them credit by associating this w/ me being now in China and giving me a warm greeting. But honestly, my dear friends, that is not my point. I'm nobody, unimportant, needing no attention, but wanting to share something I found funny, some thoughts that gave me an urge to write, and that's all it is — life is hard, don't make it more complex than it needs to be. Let's all try to be frank, straightforward, simple, direct, speaking things you truly feel, preaching things you truly believe, giving things you truly wish to, and appreciating things you truly love. Yes, love, the one thing that is full of lies in life, can at least be kept in purity in our mind, in our heart. No matter how messy the life has made mine or yours, try, not to lie. Shall we?","tags":"thoughts","url":"https://fengxia41103.github.io/myblog/indirection.html"},{"title":"Square dance","text":"You wouldn't believe where I am writing this right now! I'm sitting at this square by the subway station on my way back to my place after yet another full day visiting my Dad and another relative, and here are like hundreds of people square dancing, with the loud, rythmatic music and cold air, and subway train running by the high rise bridge with its own sound, fascinating experience! I used to look down on these square dancers, thinking that they are pretty loser by being entertained by such poor taste in public space. However, I was having a different feeling this time. As a matter of fact, I'm having a different feeling about a lot of things this time in Shanghai — at the beginning I contributed it to the terrible cold I caught which made me really dizzy together w/ jet lag. But I think there is another reason — not that I'm getting older, but that after watching my Dad and others slipping into the valley of their life, I start to accept uncertainty of life, the poor reward it gives you, and respect whoever could still hold his/her head high after a touch life, like these square dancers who are enjoying themselves without much bothered by bystanders and their opinions — they just turn on the loud speakers, inventing a step that matches the music, twist the body, arms, legs, jumping up and down, sometimes lost a beat or two, but nonetheless, they are quite, happy. Also, I think there is another thing about them which just occurred to me — why this activity makes them, happy? I wonder whether Chinese, of these groups of Chinese, only feel safe when they find themselves belong to a group? Like a herd of lamb, they have to have a social role that is part of a group so that they feel, even though they may not admit, settled. I wonder that. I don't know, but that's a strong feeling when watching these people over there. Does this explain why there are such a strong tendency for Chinese people to be fooled in a mass scale, by politicians, by lairs, or by technologists who sell their pills dressed in buzz words? I feel so. But then, human are social animals. I'm probably an odd ball in term that I do play well w/ social norms, when I choose so, just that I'm always feeling like an outsiders peeking into a glass tank of reptiles.... you know, this is really weird, that an airplane just passed above, but its engine sound is almost drowned by the loud speakers nearby, so that, what used to be annoyance for any American residents whose house is below the air trail, has no effect here whatsoever, because you simply can't hear! → isn't this a positive side effect or what!... here comes another airplane, again, I'm watching the green lights approaching, actually not slowly, but rather quickly, and yet, you can barely notices its existence because you can't hear it. Fascinating, isn't it!? Visited 大妈妈 this afternoon. Haven't seen her for, 10 years!?... has been a long long time. She is 97, and what a woman! She is still young at heart — she was making jokes, smiling, and even made a face to the camera! She is just, funny! I can't help wondering how she was like when she was young — was she pretty? was she cute? No doubt she must be really smart and sharp. What a lively and funny girl she must have been! Can't imagine it has been 24 years since my college, and I still remember sitting at her table having meal together, and she was then, as she is now, an old, tiny lady who was always smiling and talking this and that.. Yet, she hasn't changed a bit, though she has lost as much as everyone else over these years, and I only over heard from 大姐姐 that her life has been a rough one — but she was smiling, smiling, making fun w/ you, making fun w/ life, what a spirit! What a human being! I admire that, cause I won't ever be as strong as she is; I doubt many can be. Finally after these many days I started to feel my brain again ← the past few days have been a real daydream for me that I was walking, talking, doing things, but my brain was just, dead — I was so tired, tired from travel, from jet lag, from the cold and coughs... though the cough is still here, but has been much better today, and for the first time since landing in Shanghai, I start to feel that my brain is working, so that I'm now writing this, because thoughts start to flow again, and my heart starts to feel things again, something happy, something sad, someone forgotten, someone recalled, someone I wish I could see again, someone I wish I could love again, someone I could forever, be aside...

Starting w/ simple reading of different thinkers, I'm hoping I will be able to develop a connection between popular propaganda to its philosophical origin ← not that these propaganda were rooted in philosophy, but they have been dressing themselves up to sound philosophical by echoing thinkers' thoughts, thus making people believe they are deep — the propaganda is still BS, the thinker's thoughts are indeed, deep. So it is an act of camouflage. Siddhartha Gautama (Buddha) He was neither a messiah nor a prophet, and he did not act as a medium between God and Man. His ideas were arrived at through reasoning not divine revelation, and it is this that marks Buddhism out as a philosophy as much as a religion. His quest was philosophical — to discover truths — and he maintained that these truths are available to all of us through the power of reason. The four noble truths 5 : Suffering is an inherent part of existence from birth, through sickness and old age, to death → the truth of suffering (Dukkha). The cause of suffering is desire : craving for sensual pleasures and attachment to worldly possessions and power → the truth of the origin of suffering (Samudaya). Suffering an be ended by detaching oneself from craving and attachment → the truth of the ending of suffering (Nirodha). The Eightfold Path (right action right intention, right livelihood, right effort, right concentration, right speech, right understanding, and right mindfullness) is the means to eliminate desire and overcome the ego → the truth of the path to the ending of suffering (Magga). Sensual pleasures and luxury we indulge in to relieve suffering is rarely satisfying, and that when it is, the effects are transitory... the experience of extreme asceticism (austerity and abstinence) equally dissatisfying → there must be a middle way between self-indulgence and self-mortification. Nothing in the universe is self-caused, for everything is the result of some previous action, and each of us is only a transitory part of this eternal process — ultimately impermanent and without substance. So in reality, there is no \"self\" that is not part of the greater whole — or the \"not-self\" — and suffering results from our failure to recognize this. This does not mean that we should deny our existence or personal identity, rather that we should understand them for what they are — transient and insubstantial. Grasping the concept of being a constituent part of an eternal \"not-self\", rather than clinging to the notion of being a unique \"self\", is the key to losing that attachments, and finding a release from suffering. Nirvana, the ultimate goal of life on Earth is to be the ending of the cycle of suffering (birth, death, and rebirth) into which we are born. 6 Confucius The superior man does what is proper to the station in which he is; he does not desire to go beyond this. He seeks constants in a world of changing, and for his this meant as search for moral values that could enable rulers to govern justly. 3 Faithfulness and sincerity are shown in traditional rituals and ceremonies → these qualities in these settings allow virtue to become visible → virtue is then made manifest in the world → virtue can then be seen by others → others are transformed by virtue → faithfulness and sincerity hold the power of transformation . Before him, the world had been explained by mythology and religion, and power and moral authority were generally accepted to be god-given. According to Analects , we humans are the agents that Heaven has chosen to embody its will and to unite the world w/ moral order ← this part is the same as traditional view. However, 德(virtue) is not something Heaven-sent for the ruling classes, but something that can be cultivated — and cultivated by anyone. To reconcile the fact that society is a rigid class system w/ this 德 that all men can receive, he argues that virtuous man is not simply one who stands at the top of the social hierarchy, but one who understands his place within that hierarchy and embraces it to the full. How to act virtuously: 忠孝礼术 ← who sincerely observes these values are 君子. 忠 (faithfulness) is the guiding principle, 5 relationships, in order: sovereign — subject: rulers should be benevolent, and subjects loyal. father — son: parent is to be loving, and a child obedient. husband — wife: husbands are to be good and fair, and wives understanding. elder brother — younger brother: an elder sibling is to be gentle, and younger siblings respectful. friend — friend: older friends are to be considerate, and younger friends reverential. Such hierarchy reflects is significant because it reflects the fact that each person should know his station in society as a whole, as well his place in the family and the clan. How to manifest that one knows his place in society? → 孝 (filial piety) → it's more than just respect one's parents or elders. It reinforces the relationship of inferior to superior, which was the central to his thinking. 礼 (ritual propriety) is the outward signs of an inner 德, eg. ceremonies of marriage, funerals, and sacrifices to the etiquette of receiving guests. **It is only a sign of 德 when performed with sincerity. Sincerity becomes apparent. From being apparent, it becomes manifest. From being manifest, it becomes brilliant. Brilliant, it affects others. Affecting others, they are changed by it. Changed by it, they are transformed. Only he who is possessed of the most complete sincerity that can exist under Heaven, can transform. 4 One can learn to become a superior man by first recognizing what one does not know (echoing Socrates that his wisdom la in accepting that he knew nothing!), and then by watching other people ← if they show virtue, try to become their equal; if they are inferior, be their guide. The Golden Rule of \"do as you would be done by\" appears as a negative in Confucius — \"what you do not desire for yourself, do not do to others\" — Confucius does not prescribe what to do, only what not to do , emphasizing restraints rather than action. This implies modesty and humility — values traditionally held in high regard in Chinese society. Fostering these values is a form of loyalty ot oneself and another kind of sincerity. Heraclitus You can never step into the same river twice 2 . The road up and the road down are the one and the same. Everything is flux. It is the balance of opposites, such as day and night and hot and cold that leads to the unity of the universe, or the idea everything is part of a single fundamental process or substance — the central tenet of monism . Tension is generated between these pairs of opposites → everything must be in a permanent state of flux, or change — day changes into night, which in turn changes back again to day. Parmenides All is one. He employs deductive reasoning in an attempt to uncover the true physical nature of the world. From the premise that something exists (\"It is\"), Parmenides deduces that it cannot also not exist (\"It is not\"), as this would involve a logical contradiction → a state of nothing existing is impossible — there can be no void. Everything that is real must be eternal and unchanging, and must have an indivisible unity — \"all is one\". He shows by his process reasoning that our perception of the world if faulty and full of contradictions → we can never rely on the experience that is delivered to us by our senses. Protagoras (a Sophist 1 ) Many things prevent knowledge, including the obscurity of the subject and the brevity of human life. Man is the measure of all things. It is spring day in Athens → A visitor from Sweden says the weather is warm ; a visitor from Egypt says the weather is cold → Both people are speaking the truth . → The truth depends on prospective and is therefore relative. → Man is the measure of all things. Belief is subjective, and it is the man holding the view or opinion that is the measure of its worth... This relativism also applies to moral values, such as what is right and what is wrong. To Protagoras, nothing is inherently good in itself. Something is ethical, or right, only because a person or society judges it to be so. Also, it shifted focus of philosophy away from an understanding of the nature of the universe to an examination of human behavior. Greek sophia : widsom ↩ However, the river itself is always described as one fixed and unchanging thing. ↩ Confucius's teachings make a lot of sense when viewed in its historical background that it was the period of the Warring States — thus how to rule properly and how to bring peace back to life is an urge issue to solve. ↩ However, I think this reasoning is inherently flawed. By stating \"the most\", it implies that there could only be one man fits such role, thus automatically ruling out all could become 君子. Only one. ↩ I like this, a clean layout of reasoning — definition of problem (suffering), analysis (cause of suffering), solution (how to end suffering), roadmap of execution of solution (eightfold path). Brilliant! ↩ Wow, so the idea of rebirth is actually a sign that you are going to suffer, again! How this is the opposite of popular beliefs! ↩","tags":"thoughts","url":"https://fengxia41103.github.io/myblog/philosophy.html"},{"title":"YMCA","text":"I start to like coming to this YMCA lobby for work in the afternoon. Coming here a bit earlier than Noah's pickup time, and I can sit here just breathe the atmosphere, watching people coming in and out in their gym clothes, listenning to a light music in the background, tempted by the White Oak coffee right across to my table, putting feet up on the bench, with a high ceiling of, I don't know, 20 fee or more, and knowing that at any minute I can go to see Noah, or the kids will just come out to get their snacks here w/ their counselor... all these thoughts, make me, happy, relaxed happy. It was cloudy in the morning. But the temperature has been rising over the day, and now there is sun, though it's getting close to be a sunset now, so the Sun feels rather, relaxed also, that it beams its heat here and there, but also dancing w/ this music, here and there, no agenda, no purpose. Then, I thought of you. You know, you have always been giving me this feeling that you should have a life just this — happy, warm, relaxed, surrounded by things and people you love/care, just wondering here and there, no agenda. I think you will like this place. I can almost hear what you will say if you were here. Well, maybe not. I used to knowing you so well that I could tell what you would say. But not anymore. I don't know what you would say, but still, I think you will like it — the high ceiling, the concrete floor, the coffee shop w/ no customer, the people walking by, the kids in the lobby, xmas decorations, wood frames that brings warmth, the bench I'm sitting on, and the life, filled w/ holiday airs, maybe the music could be better, like playing the list I have collected over the years since you introduced me this app since we first met, but still, it's nice, and I wish you were here, to experience all these. I don't know. Will there be a day that someday, you will be sitting here, and thinking of me, thinking what I would have said or written? You probably never would, nor guess that I have written all these to you. It's ok. Everytime I went to the Reader's Corner for books, I was always wondering how the owner of those books would feel that now they are lying in this shop, picked up by strangers like me — so many books had handwritings on the front page saying \"Dear who and who, I hope you will like this book... Love, who and who\". Will the giver be disappointed if s/he knew that the person this book was given to has not dumped it to a second hand book shop for almost nothing (and too often I heard \"I'm moving\" \"I'm cleaning the closet\")? But when it was still a gift, maybe even in a wrap, it carried so much thoughts, so much expectations, so much, likes, loves... it's sad to think this way, isn't it? But still, I'm writing down these because they came to me, the moment I was closing the car door, feeling the sun's warmth on the head, you, came to my mind — always, always, when there is a breeze, when there is a blue sky, when there is clouds floating like a group of cottons, when there is a tune, when there is clinkings of cups and utensils from a coffee shop... always, always, always, I wish all these that make me happy, belong to you. I miss you very much.","tags":"thoughts","url":"https://fengxia41103.github.io/myblog/ymca.html"},{"title":"Strange things of Javascript","text":"God, isn't Angular confusing! and I really think it is because of its shaky underline language — Javascript, is itself, confusing. Well, even by just looking at its name, how many people have thought that it is a script derived from Java!? Oh well well, here are some notes I take while studying Angular(JS, sometimes), and .js . Btw, there is another article about all the confusion of ES<a number> denotation that can clarify those naming/version hell. scope Scope is always the most fundamental concept I read of a language, and for all I know, I'm expecting something like a global and a local , that a local is always private to its enclosed curly brackets or any nearest declaration chunk — if it is declared in a function, it is available in a function, not outside; if it is declared in a for loop, well, it is only useful inside the for loop, not outside. But there comes this country boy Javascript, and for the first time I realized there are actually 3 scopes: global, function, and block . It turned out that anything declared w/ a var xyz can not have a block scope ! What does this mean, var x = 10 ; // Here x is 10 { var x = 2 ; // Here x is 2 } // Here x is 2 So the 2nd declaration of var x=2 is not creating a new private variable that is only useful inside the curly bracket 1 . On the contrary, it re declare the former var x=10 , but now overwriting its (I guess the reference) w/ a value of 2. Isn't this strange! So it turned out that Before ES2015 JavaScript did not have Block Scope. ref Well well well, so before the year of 2015, how many poor javascript coders have tripped on this!? and how many poor written code has been generated? and why the hell it sets such a trap to begin w/!? So the correct way is: var x = 10 ; // Here x is 10 { let x = 2 ; <== using the `let` // Here x is 2 } // Here x is 10 This doesn't seem very bad if you are enclosing a lot of them into functions. But still, try this (really, this is a nasty bug!): var i = 5 ; for ( var i = 0 ; i < 10 ; i ++ ) { // some statements } // Here i is 10 Things like this, makes it very difficult for me to like Javascript. hoisting WTF. After being in the trade for 20+ years, this is the very first time I heard something like this: Hoisting is JavaScript's default behavior of moving declarations to the top. ref This seems quite fine since it's trying to be smart. But then, here comes the rub: JavaScript only hoists declarations, not initializations. What that means? Two examples below: Example 1: var x = 5 ; // Initialize x var y = 7 ; // Initialize y console . log ( \"x is \" + x + \" and y is \" + y ); Example 2: var x = 5 ; // Initialize x console . log ( \"x is \" + x + \" and y is \" + y ); var y = 7 ; // Initialize y Two logs generate different results: - example 1: x is 5 and y is 7 - example 2: x is 5 and y is undefined As a matter of fact, example 2 is equivalent to this: var x = 5 ; // Initialize x var y ; // declaration console . log ( \"x is \" + x + \" and y is \" + y ); var y = 7 ; // Initialize y I think the problem of this confusion roots in the decision that JS allows the use of y even before it has been declared (as seen in the original example 2 code above)! In any other language, it will do one of the two things: variable will be declared implicitly and given a value of null/undefined, sth like that ← this is always a bad idea on the coder's part 2 . compiler will just balk w/ an error ← preferred. Btw, the new let and const are not hoisted. Thus, if you just declare a let feng; , too bad, it stays where it is in its line number. True versus Truthy, !!me In Javascript, the evaluation of a variable to be True or False is a tricky thing. There are two aspects you need to be aware: strict vs. not-so-strict The strict versions are === or !== , which will only equal if both the value and the type are the same. Otherwise, say you use == , you are depending on Javascript's engine implementation, which, well, is not necessarily what you want, because something is Truthy is not the same that it is True . truthy What is truthy? That the variable is not evaluated to a Boolean (True or False), but is considers sort of true (or _sort_of_false): falsey : Empty string: \"\" 0 null undefined NaN truthy : Object: {} Array: [] Not empty string: \"anything\" Number other than zero: 3.14 Date: new Date(); So if truthy will be a positive logic, but this counter-intuitive when you would expect an empty {} or [] to be falsey. You can take one step further to convert whatever into a Boolean by using double exclamation marks: !!myVar , and you will get a true or false . No ambiguity, thus if True or if False . But if you define the curly as a function, the var inside will have a function scope , and it is only visible to the function itself, not outside the function. ↩ We do use this a lot in python in which we don't have to declare a variable explicitly. But then, it is a solid decision in Python, and I don't recall ever need to be aware a trap like what this hoisting idea is producing. ↩","tags":"dev","url":"https://fengxia41103.github.io/myblog/strange%20things%20of%20javascript.html"},{"title":"Is it fate?","text":"Upcoming trip in six days now. For some reason I'm feeling anxious of this trip since a few weeks ago — a feeling of both excitement and worry. Unlike the 2016 trip to 深圳, before which I had a feeling before the trip that \"something is going to happen\", and I meant something that is big , and it did, I met her. This time the feeling is more of an uncertainty because I don't know what is going to happen, not much of self-confidence that \"yes I will be ok\", but that if something happens, I don't know how I will come through, maybe good, maybe bad. Had a talk w/ Li Jian over Friday's lunch, about fate. Of course we were just joking about whether there is such that we meant to see each other at lunch time to have lunch, then I joked that I must not the one in his pre-life to put a cover over his body when he was lying on a beach — a derivative of the 鸡汤 story that a girl was found on the beach, naked, the first man walked by and didn't do anything, the second man did something, don't remember what it is now, then came along the third guy who went over and put his coat over her body — then after cycles of rebirth, the girl became the third guy's wife in this life, to repay his kindness on the beach. Familiar story line. Always this gets to the moral of the story that it is fate/destiny for the two people to be together in marriage — inevitable, meant to be, w/ a noble reason behind it, always. But then, it just occurred to me, this logic plays in this direction, but what about the other point of view — the guy in this case, is he ready to receive such arrangement!? We all know too well that in love there isn't a promise that if I love you, you will definitely love me back. Well well, then in this cycle of repayment of love/kindness/whatever, who says the guy is ready, or even happy, to receive the girl's give-back!? Nobody! As a matter of fact, I can even argue that the not-to-receive is more likely to occur than the expected fateful arrangement. Think about it. If the guy is such a kind person, he must have done quite a few good deeds in that life cycle, which then means that all of them will seek a route to repay his kindness, do they spread out in such a way so that only one occurs in his life cycles afterwards? but even so, what if he continues to be a good person so to generate more good deeds? This certainly will become a compound math, which after a few cycles/generations, will become a quite large number!! So when the girl shows up in his life, ready to be his wife, there is likely a queue lining up w/ similar cases, thus she has to wait for her turn, which God knows how long the queue is, what if her life runs out before her turn is up? does she lose her spot in the line if she dies and tries again in the next life cycle? That sounds pretty, depressing. Let's assume that she saves her spot, there still isn't any guarantee that the guy will love her, or even like her, well, of course we can argue that this entire process is all about her paying the deeds, not him giving her anything, thus it doesn't matter how bumpy the road of her giving-back is, actually, the bumpier, the better because, like the trip to the West, all challenges turn into proof of her determination, thus a hallmark of the fateful ! Fascinating, isn't it!? But now I can see a flaw in all these, and feminist will love what I discovered — the fateful story was created to beautify love, making it a quite touching story because the relationship you two forms extends way beyond this life. However, by having the woman lying on the beach, it has put woman in the passive position for the rest of her rebirth cycles → she has to wait in the guy's pay-me-back queue, take chance of him favouring her so to give her a change, and jump through hoops and hurdles in between to demonstrate her will and purity of intention — all these, are unfairly put upon the woman, because she received an act of kindness!! Further, the moral of such story implies that life becomes an accounting book of good deeds and bad deeds, that you will have to settle/balance somehow, in some generation, sooner or later. In the western world, you settle w/ God at your death, say, donate all your properties to church so to be saved (book is reset to 0). Here in this oriental version, you setting w/ that kind person by becoming his wife or something, but this is shakier than setting w/ God because, in theory, there is only one God, so the identity is clear, and logic behind this God is quite clear, too, like written in a book which people study and teach and learn , but settling w/ some guy/girl which you have no memory whatsoever, only a fuzzy feeling that maybe you know him/her!? Man, that doesn't sound a sure thing at all!!! But, isn't fate supposed to be, well, sure!? So by making up a story like such to describe the effect of fate, it completely miss the point by making the effect rather uncertain, thus defeating its own preach. Maybe I'm overthinking again, but this mental exercise is quite, amusing. I wonder whether many other so called legends should be scrutinized in such a way as well, just to see whether it has an inconsistent logic that breaks itself. That will be fun actually. Anyway. So much for the fate. At least, I think you shouldn't use that lying-on-beach story anymore, because it is quite wrong. But me meeting her back then, yes, it is fateful, because I can't ever forget, however many lives I will be through, live, and die.","tags":"thoughts","url":"https://fengxia41103.github.io/myblog/is%20it%20fate.html"},{"title":"Software engineer","text":"Had a chat w/ a young engineer on the team about career, technology, what to study/learn. Whiling writing my responses, many thoughts came to me, so I'm pasting the email here since I believe they are very relevant in these topics, and they are truthfully represent what I think about them. data structure, project Euler I don't recommend you study data structure or OS on paper at all. There are three data structures you need to know, and they cover 90% of all cases you will ever encounter in your career — array, link list, and hash table. In Python's term, they are list -> array, no equivalent -> link list, and dictionary -> hash table. Pick a language you feel comfortable w/, and whatever the term they use to describe these 3 data structures, read about them. There is no better way to study them other than finding a real problem to solve using these. I recommend you to try Project Euler . They are pure mathematical problems, and forces you to use these data structure creatively for your computation because they only have two criterias: get the right answer compute the answer in < 1 minute You will be surprised (and impressed) how to solve these problems. For example, finding the 1 million-th prime number... Once you get a few problems solved (starting from problem 1), I can assure you you will start to see things in arrays and hash tables. a word on link list You don't see link list much in today's SW job, and you will be wondering why I recommend it. If you ever do embedded system, or OS for that matter, anything low level, you see link list EVERYWHERE. It's the concept that matter -- how data can be chained (nothing fancy, just a pointer to the NEXT, and another to PREV). This same concept, however, will map into anything needs scaling up/down — pagination on UI, a task queue, a sequential workflow. So without reading their code, you can already grasp the concept how they could have implemented it. Now, the reason I recommend this is, is because of the data model relationships (see below section \"relationships\"). data modeling, philosophy, life What you have said in email, actually, is not data structure, but data modeling. Data structure is too low level; very few people need to deal w/ that kind of idea. If you want to write your own SQL database, yes, you need data structure; if you want to use Postgresql, or Java/Python/Ruby to solve a biz problem, you need data modeling. There is no golden rule for data modeling, just like there isn't a good/bad architecture — they are just subjective opinions. The quality of such subjective opinion, however, reflects the person's philosophy, which then came from his/her education, life experience, whether was in love or dumped, missed breakfast that morning or not.. and so on. I'm not joking; data modeling is the arts side of software engineering, you can't learn it, you have to practice it. How to practice it? Implement an idea as web based application. Any idea, any web framework, doesn't matter, because the first thing you will be forced to do is data modeling. two models There are only two things in data modeling — model, and their relationship. And in models, there are two types in my opinion — Sth maps to something real (physical product, for example, a model called LenovoSwitch , or conceptual,for example, vlan ). For these, attributes are already defined — you need to study them, learn, and use them. For example, you can't invent an attribute called \"color\" for model \"Vlan\", but there must be a field called \"id\" because each vlan must have an ID! Sth you invented because you say so, for example, in Netbox there is model \"site\", well, who says my definition of \"site\" is correct? and who says it needs a name ? 长安街上有很多sites have no name, but a number! How about that!? You see, this is where your philosophy stuffy comes in — designing data model is completely your world view against others. The problem/key is open-mindness — if you design the site to be a string, then you need to aware that when you save \"number\" to it, numbers would have to be converted, which makes it difficult to validate, say, some naming convention. Alternatively, you can design two attributes -- name , and id .... see, if you are a good thinker, you will perceive these possibilities in design, and will have to make a lot of choices. But this is what I call \"conscious decisions\" — this is completly different from those 我从来没想到过的scenario. So for a good data modeler, deep thinking is key. However, you will be very unhappy, because, after all, no philosopher was a happy person. You know the phrase that \"devils are in the details\". Well, what kind of person will be happy dealing w/ devils!? three relationships Easy, 3 types only: 1->N: foreign key 1-1: strong bind, eg. you can only have one biological father. N->N: matrix Any model you designed will have one of these three relationships, and the choice you make determines the quality of your design. Period. In Netbox, if I design Site and Rack to be \"1-1\", I'm screwed. But whenever you feel confident, or want to restrict the possibility, you should 1:1 as much as possible. The more of this you have, the narrow the scope is, the better quality your code will be, because boundaries are clear. \"N-N\" is a cheap one, catch all. If you don't know what relationship it should have, give it N-N; but this is lazy work by the designer. It's a strong signal that you don't understand the problem well yet. \"1-N\" is 90% of all cases, because I believe that is how human brain works — we look at things in a tree mode. You must have seen Chinese biz love to show off their \"deep thinking\" in mind map, or terms like 分层，分等，分级，金字塔结构... what they are really saying is, 1-N, but of course, they don't understand this part. Tree can grow in size quickly, and what they really are is, yes, link list! Therefore, link list is the implementation of tree. In your model, once you formulate these relationships, the limitation becomes very obvious — you will never agree to a sale whose customer wants N sites in 1 rack, because your model doesn't allow this! Therefore, it amazes me many SW engr allows the boss to ask for anything — it's not that I disagree w/ him being the boss, it's that I'm defending my world view — How can I just nodd w/o a fight? And because these relationships define the limitations, it becomes an art (but also the fun). Therefore, the experience, the deep thinking, the books you read, will dictate your world view, and that will reflect in your choice in design. There isn't a single book you must read; you should read any book you want, but think, think, think. The more biased you are, meaning the stronger an opinion you will have on the issue, the better, because you won't have your own opinion unless you have given it a lot of thoughts, will you!? Writing essay of life, of news, of a movie, or a music, is actually a good way to learn this, not writing code. I started writing essays in MBA. The beginning was painful; but it became a habit, and I highly recommend it. what to learn Don't be fooled by buzz words — AI, big data, whatever. These things come and go. Business needs to talk about them so they appear to be relevant. But don't let them define you. Javascript is becoming more and more powerful. Learn Angular or React to write 1 or 2 hobby applications. I think JS has a strong future/job. Don't learn Ruby. It has passed its prime. I don't hear it much anymore. Python, C#, .net, Java, Scala, R... they are all the same, popular right now, but they are just tools, and tools don't solve problem, brain solves problems. They are all fully capable, and overkill for any biz problem you will ever be hired for. The only time I ran into limitation of Python was doing a Euler problem, that Python only allows 27 decimal points(!)... so yes, if you compute size of the Galaxy, the choice of language matters; otherwise, don't bother. Pick one you enjoy writing, that fits your way of thinking/typing/sleeping/whatever, and use it often. I never learned Java, and didn't catch Go, because I looked at them, and didn't like their style at all. But I fell in love w/ Python in 1998, because it uses TAB for code, and makes the code look, nice! Think this way. If now there is a war going on in Shanghai, will you feel better w/ a bow and arrow which you can shoot in a blink of an eye, or a 东风 missile that takes probably you and another 12 ppl to operate and 6 hours to launch? I get it that the 东风 will kill thousands in one hit; but if you are walking on the street, that power doesn't help me at all if you just ran into someone hostile. career Last word on career. SW is an unhappy one. The better you become, the unhappier you will be. Biz ppl chase buzz words, thus they will require you to write in . (Well, does anyone ever care what language Google search engine was first written in?) Therefore, your \"skills\" become obsolete in a matter of 2 years. This is BS; but I don't know how to change this. Thus, you feel pushed to learn new language, new lib, new this and that, solving the same old problem, differently perhaps. But the real issue is not that previous solution didn't work; nobody ever bothered to investigate the core of the issue at the first place! I can't tell you how many times in China I was asked to make a SW that allows them manipulating data/number (of course, 中国特色，业务需要), while expecting the number on the report to actually match! ← this, again, is a philosophical problem, because they are asking 当了 婊子立牌坊. However, the world seems populated w/ such requests, such people. The do-ers will end up being at the bottom of the hierarchy, having the best knowledge and strongest skills, and lowest rewards. So, what to do? Dont rush to 创业， unless u have a rich Dad. But even then, don't, because that's not your money, you didn't earn it, thus shouldn't experiment w/ others' money. But do create. Create as often as the thought comes to you, whatever it is, using your skills to create — a website, a blog, a mobile app, a POC of some library, a script that makes our daily work easier — start to work, smart, not harder. When I first learned Python, I was tired of looking over 10+M of log files searching for an error message. Script can do it in 1 second; and it took 10 days to write one, maybe. But writing the script is fun, learning exp, and you become stronger, and 10+M or 100+M logs make no difference anymore! That's the way to work. So again, too many ppl working HARD because they don't work smart. 磨刀不误砍柴功, everybody knows the phrase, very few practices it. SW is powerful tool, and powerful concept. By using it, you will have a sharp observation of the world, a strong opinion of a problem, a know-how to actually move forward (how many entrepreneurs are just, talking!?). Remember why we go to school and pursue education? Because the only thing that belong to you, is your knowledge; everything else you have, today, are, well, removable. Your know-how, however, is yours. It is sad that engineers are viewed as commodities. But don't become one. If you don't believe anyone who knows alphabets can just write 红 楼梦, then knowing has nothing to do being a good programmer/engineer. Engineering is hard work, but solid, because at the end of all the BS, gears must match exactly, the \"if x==y\" must be true or not, no 3rd option! I like to end w/ the example of the Alpha Go. Go was viewed as Zen, and no one bothered to really figure out its engineering/mathematical patterns till Google come along. Once it's codified, human can only cry — it has never been Zen, it was viewed as Zen only because figuring it out is hard. Engineers are those ppl who have a desire to see how it works; others are just satisfied w/ that it works, but becomes victims easily because, well, they have no reference . Isn't it better to fail w/ knowing why, rather than fail w/o?","tags":"dev","url":"https://fengxia41103.github.io/myblog/software%20engineer.html"},{"title":"Misconception","text":"I'm in a constant amazement how misconcepted this world is, by me, and by many many others. Not only of this world as it is now, but the so called history, things that have happened, have passed, should have been written in stone, crystal clear, no ambiguity. Yet, when reading a book like this one , it's truly an eye opener that what I thought I have known, what everybody thinks they have known, were not so, were, perhaps, forgotten, or, were not understood in the first place. Sometimes I feel the history is playing a funny game, that by a common sense, the longer you wait, usually the more faded the memory becomes, thus the more likely what was remember became less and less accurate or reliable , like what I have argued against in this article that many of the Chinese elites are propogating the main stream idea of China's history with much distortion, which are obviously illogical because they failed in cross checks. But they were invented anyway so to fit for the needs of the uprising nationalism sentiment and of course, the needs of the ruling authority at all levels, whatever the level may be, and whatever the ruler's taste and preference may be. As the proverb says, 上有所好, there must then be providers to satisfy it. But on the other hand, there is another convention that the longer you wait before looking back, the clearer you will start to see what was truly the case, because the effect of the even had been known, had played out, and it's much easier (in theory) to formulate a causal argument which is both convincing and closer to the truth, even though I also constantly have the doubt that causal relationship is but another human invention to assist our perception, and there are, have been, and always will be, many many casual relationships that can be formed out of any two events, historical events in particular, because they can not be tested again, thus are nothing but interpretations, your words against mine, that kind of deal. Nonetheless, the more stepped back you are from the event, the more likely you are less partial about one way or the other, thus giving you a better chance to be neutral and objective, cool-headed, to cut through the mess and see the core. But doing so also requires not only knowledge and judgement, but practice, then, how would one gain practice without first making a lot of such mistakes? This ask itself is illogical, isn't it? What a catch 22! I never read the The Grapes of Wrath , and didn't know John Steinbeck . But this book is fascinating. I wish I could type it down because there are so many points I couldn't agree more. More importantly, the process that America has emerged, how people have treated newcomers , are the exact same pattern being played out in China, in a new community, in a team in a company, over and over and over, thus making me to believe that this pattern is not only common, but is speaking loud how human groups behave, predictably, unchanged. Actually everytime I came across a book like this, I can't help having an urge to go back to school and take on social studies — though I am disgusted by human's behavior I witness everyday, especially during the morning rush hours on the road, I think social study as a way to research and observe human and human group, is the much harder task to undertake than an engineering challenge ← I can learn many many of the hard science and math, but I can't get even a slim grip on human's emotion, desire, reaction, thinking. It's either that I'm just bad at it, or, they are just too damn hard! Anyway. Let me type down the first misconception of America, that people have come to this land to form a paradise on earth with everybody being a sisterhood or brotherhood, such a friendly place, friendly people, wonder idea — wrong, wrong, wrong. And I'm hoping that by reading this, you will start to question everything you think you have come to see and hear, and wonder, whether they have become a misconception: It is customary (indeed, at high-school graduation it is a requirement) for speakers to refer to America as a \"precious inheritance\" — our heritage, a gift proffered like a sandwich wrapped in plastic on a plastic try. Our ancestors, so it is implied, gatherd to the invitation of a golden land and accepted the sacrament of milk and honey. This is not so. In the beginning, we crept, scuttled, escaped, were driven out of the safe and settled corners of the earth to the fringes of a strange and hostile wilderness, a nameless and hostile continent. Some rulers granted large sections of unmapped territory, in places they did not own or even know, as cheap gifts to favorites or to potential enemies for the purpose of getting rid of them. Many others were sent here as a punishment for penal offenses. Far from welcoming us, this continent resisted us. The Indigenes fought to the best of their ability to hold on to a land they thought was theirs. The rocky soils fought back, and the bewildering forests, and the deserts. Diseases, unknown and therefore incurable, decimated the early comers, and in their energy of restlessness they fought one another. This land was no gift. The firstlings worked for it, fought for it, and died for it. They stole and cheated and double-crossed for it, and when they had taken a little piece, they way a fierce-hearted man ropes a wild mustang, they had then to gentle it and smooth it and make it habitable at all. Once they had a foothold, they had to defend their holdings against new waves of the restless and ferocious and hungry. America did not exist. Four centuries of word, of bloodshed, of loneliness and fear created this land. We built America and the process made us Americans — a new breed, rooted in all races, stained and tinted with all colors, a semming ethnic anarchy. Then in a little, little time, we became more alike than we were different — a new society; not great, but fitted by our very faults for greatness, E Pluribus Unum . The whole thing is crazy. Every single man in our emerging country was out for himself against all others — for his safety, his profit, his future. He had little care for the land; he ripped it, raped it, and in some cases destroyed it. He cut and burned the forests, fired and plowed the plains, dredged the beautiful rivers for gold, leaving a pebbled devastation. When his family grew up about him he set it against all other families. When communities arose, each one defended itself against other communities. The provinces which became states were each one a suspicious unit, with jealously held borders and duties, tolls, and penalities against strangers. The surges of the new restless, needy, and strong — grudgingly brouhg in for purposes of hard labor and cheap wages — were resisted, resented, and accepted only when a new and different wave came in. Consider how the Germans clotted for self-defense until the Irish took the resented place; how the Irish became \"Americans\" against the Poles, the Slavs against the Italians. On the West Coast the Chinese ceased to be enemies only when the Japanese arrived, and they in the face of the invasions of Hindus, Filipinos, and Mexicans. Nor were the dislikes saved exclusively for foreigners. When dust and economics rooted up the poor dirt farmers of Oklahoma and pushed them westward, they were met with perhaps even more suspicion and resentment than the other waves.","tags":"thoughts","url":"https://fengxia41103.github.io/myblog/misconception.html"},{"title":"Noah says","text":"This is to keep track what Noah says these days, some smart remarks. But first of all, let me vent what this kid is like, this morning, that was totally pissing me off!! — so I was cleaning his glasses the last minute before leaving for school bus. There is this missing piece off one of the legs, looked like the plastic has been burned off by fire. So I asked what happened to it, he replied: \"I chewed it off.\" \"But why!?\" \" I had this sudden desire to chew it. \" Said calmly and unshamefully. WTF! So here goes the first line of his I'm writing down. So him. Commenting on the new badminton coach he had in class. \"This guy is all about power.\" \"Oh so he was a power player. That's good.\" \"Not really. Sometimes power has to bow to wisdom. \" — very philosophical, isn't it!? 8:30 pm. Out of nowhere, after his Mom left for gym, he said to me, \"爸，我决定了，等你有了517, 我和你住\" \"Why?\" \"Because I think it will be difficult living with her.\" \"Why?\" \"So she bought snack without looking at the label, and it turned out to be wasabi flavored, and I was the first one eating it, and I didn't have water then...\" hahaha!! Poor little guy!! But I asked him whether he has other reasons for this decision, and he said, \"第二， she gets up late, so there is increasing chance I'll be late for schoolbus.\" \"Anything else?\" \"Yes. I'm actually feeling scared by myself at home, though everytime I said I will be ok.\" \"You mean when she goes to gym and leaves you at home?\" \"Yes\" \"Then tell her so next time.\" \"ok\" \"I leave you for gym when you come with me in the office also.\" \"But that's daytime.\"..... \"Of course. You can come live with me anytime. I'll get you a key... wait, I'll introduce you to the concierge, so she will know you, and you can just come whenever you want.\" 10:00 pm. Math, struggling w/ the concept of \"20% off\", which he subtracted $0.2 . Why so? \"So how much is 20%?\" \"It's 20 over 100\" \"So how much will that be?\" \"0.2, 20 cents\". Speechless, isn't it! \"Noah, remember to think before you ask.\" Pretty common conversation between. I don't recall what the topic was. Anyway. Listen to this. \"爸， 我在新加坡的时候就有think.\" Very firm tone. \"Really!? How?\" \"你记得吗？那个时候我想要touch一个bird poop\" \"我不记得了...然后呢？\" \"然后你说了No\" \"Yeah, that sounds right!\" \"但是那个时候我就有think\" \"How!?\" this is interesting \"真的 真的！那个时候我就在think, 那个bird poop看起来是dry, 所以我就很想要 touch它\"...... speechless, isn't it!? What an example he gave to testify that he actually, thinks ~~ Noah figured out how to put his math answer back into the equation to verify, \"哇塞，我做的这么对！！\" He was genuinely surprised by himself, haha, what a fun to watch him grow in moment like this. A beautiful early summer evening. After a long stressful day evacuating the contractor and his tools, having a barbecue w/ Noah outside the kitchen. He was talking w/ his mom about virus vs. bacteria. Mom was asking about \"do you know which virus, and the only virus, cured by human so far?\" (it was Hypatitis-C). Noah studied his science vigilantly in the week and the topic was about virus & bacteria, so he was confident in the discussion. However, he didn't have this piece. So instead he realized his gap, and said \"Do you know what I cured?... Dad's loneliness.\" ← because in that afternoon, he was my companion to 517 to clean up the mess left by the contractor, and on the way home I said thank you to him for being my companion. How funny!! On our way home from 517, I was commenting on Noah's hair and asked him \"what is his secret\". Guess what he said? He was very serious and also in a good mood, responded that \"I will give you one advice, is to use woman product.\" \"Why woman product?\" \"因为她们总 是想要look good, so you must use woman product\" \"所以你用她们的 product, 你也会look good\" \"是啊，and I use 妈的shampoo\" \"是吧， 但 是那都得等很久，像什么15分钟，我没那个耐心，那你怎么办的？\" \"I will meditate\" \"meditate?\" \"yeah\" \"what if it's still too long?\" \"那我就 put on more shampoo\"... hahahaha.... this is the very first time Noah seriously gives me his advice, and you can tell he is really believing in his own discovery in this one! This one heard from his mom. She caught him taking a loooooong time in shower, and asked him what's taking him so long. \"你的shower 有 很多头发堵了，我在给你de堵\".... what a, Chinglish? On our way back from 517. There was a shower in some areas ahead of us. So by the time we were on the road, it was wet. All of sudden, Noah said \"yi2\" \"what\" \"彩色，虹\", you know, in a mumbling kinda of way, that he heard the word spoken by us, but doesn't really know how to say it properly. Very cute! At dinner table, Noah started a thread, \"爸，你知道，葡萄美酒夜光 杯，是啥么？\"\"知道啊，这个叫唐诗。你咋知道的？\" So it turned out he saw it on mom's phone the other night, and he thought it's extremely funny, because, \"美酒，no wine!\" he claimed, and started laughing hard, by himself.... errr....pretty speechless ~~ Had a wechat call w/ 陈思，I figure it would be good to connect him with some social friends at his age, and help him to establish some confidence. After an hour of talk, I asked \"so 陈思家有只兔子 是吧？\"\"对，她家有只兔子，还有很多鱼，她还有很多鸟....她还养了个姐 \".. hahaha... well, so I was overhearing their conversation, that the girl introduced her older sister, and Noah brought up the Telling Noah we will have 豆腐骨头西红柿汤. He suddenly raised his head, looked at with an expression of awe, \"等一下，你是说，今天的 豆腐有骨头?\"..... hahaha ~~ The kid is always super precise ! Was at dinner at his mom's place over 2020 xmas. He was having something in the breakfast, and his mom commented that this is something he has been longing to have, thus he is now 如原以偿. He immediately countered, \"No! 我没有常想(这个东西）I didn't always think of it\".. oh well, what can I say? At lunch chatting w/ Noah about the small room I'm thinking to decorate. \"我觉得那个屋子可以用来打游戏\"，\"I agree! 它又小，又黑， 还有门\".. huh!? hahaha, and he bursted into a laugh himself also. Both of us realized what he meant → so he could shut himself inside and play as much as he wants. Hahahaha. After dinner, showing Noah the old album I brought back from Suzhou. There was picture of Dad when he was probably late 20s, and he didn't recognize him. Then on the next page, another of his, probably early 40s, and Noah pointed it out, \"这是也爷爷!\" \"Not bad. How do u know?\" \"Because 他在 sporting 他现在的 look\"... hahaha! Saturday morning, asked Noah to help w/ breakfast — cutting an apple, and a grapefruit. I guessed I said \"orange\" when I handed the grapefruit to him. So he peeled it, the way he always wanted to do.. I held my tongue this time, \"let him do this, and it should be fine\".. then, I put some on his plates, knowing grapefruit isn't his thing. But, behold! He took a bite, and gave me a looking of eating a poison! \"爸！！！你为什么说这是 orange! 这是grapefruit!\" \"我说了！\"\"你没有!!\"\"咋了吧!?\" I asked. \" 如果这是grapefruit, 我刚才cut的时侯会更严肃点!!\"\"what do mean by严 肃点!?\"... so it turned out, by peeling his way, he left some those soft skins, which, according to him, is bitter, and his 更严 肃点 is to remove more, if not all of, those skins... hahaha!! 更 严肃点~~~ Trying to solicit him taking interest in Chinese. So I let him watch the romance of the three kingdom by 横山光辉, w/ English subtitle. So it calls \"字\" as style name . So I was trying to teach him what a 字 means in a name, then, he pointed at the screen, \"萌的!!!\" (the sound), and it is showing 曹操， \"style name: Mengde\".... hahahaha!!! Noah noah noah, what am I gonna do w/ your Chinese!? 11/15/2022 Sitting in Starbuck and he just finished his math homeworks. Asking him to throw away a leftover box to trash. Guess what!? He turned around w/ a stack of triangometry problem sheets in hand, and immediately he started working on it!? ... is this the same guy I know!? Unbelievable! and he looked quite happy working on the sheets. What a surprise! I asked him why, and he said he just wants to do more.. and 2nd trip to the same trash can he picked up yet another stack! hahaha... we joked about some kid throwing away his/her math homeworks that way so to avoid working on it and had a good laugh out of this. Wonderful time! 2/23/2023 On our way to his swimming. \"Did you eat something?\" \"yeah I had salmon\" \"哦， 是吧，家里有salmon啊!!\" \"现在没了\" ... hahaha... such an American way of understanding Chinese. No Chinese native would have interpreted the line on such a face value, but he did.. it was just halirious! I think this will be a great item for some foreigner's TOEFL test someday. 5/29/2024 Sitting at a high table McDonald's after his swim training at night. I said, \"I'm thinking to get a 大house, you know, with a big yard...你觉得这主意怎么样?\" He shook his head. \" 不好吗？\" Shaking head.. \"为啥?\" \"你一take eyes off,它就跑了 \"... huh? I couldn't understand what he was saying.. \"huh? 为啥它 就跑了?\" \"你看，你不是说大hao4 (s)zi1 么，你不看它它就跑了\".. then I suddenly realized, he meant 大house as 大耗子.

When I had them, usually on the way to work, or was busy cooking, I thought I would have them down a moment later. But when I get to the office, immediately I got sidetracked into audition of Jira, emails, meetings, meetings, meeting of meetings... this pattern is just becoming too much a bore to my taste. I wonder how those great author had been able to write what they wrote, while they themselves must have had all the ordinary worries of life, good days, bad days, a moment of light, and a long period of darkness? how did they do that? Is overcoming these nuances the true struggle to deliver those master pieces? Did these nuances actually make the author, I mean, in the way that it hardens his/her will, sharpens his/her observation and feeling, lets him to see through the superficial window dressing of life, of the matter he was writing about, and forces him to experience the things that hurts so badly, thus touching not only himself, but his reader? I think so. The real tough thing of living is the life itself, and the fact that when hardship hits, it doesn't guarantee to end your life, but only guarantees to makes you unhappy. And while breathing, you have to sustain and survive the unhappiness, trying to get up again in the morning, doing whatever the job and the family is calling for, feeding yourself 3 times a day, dealing w/ water bills, leaking toilet, miss charged back account, broken down car, traffic, sitting through meetings which you have little to say but was dragged in as a head count and relevant person (how ridiculous!), kids suspended by school or the YMCA because he \"laid his hand on another kid\" even though, according to his own account, he was fed up by a kid bullying another kid, thus punched the bullying one in the stomach ← and I gave him credit for doing so, because for the first time in our relationship I start to see a silhouette of what he will be, and I like him to be that way — being a person who doesn't fear to step forward for things he deems wrong (excellent job Noah!)... and if you have lived through all these, are in the midst of all these, and still have a mind and a thought watching out for the world around you — the autumn leaves turning color, the breeze w/ a slight drizzle, the mellow sound of guitar when the air is moist, the night I was thinking of you, wishing to speak to you of these things, of the mind when I still have it, of your days, your dream, your wish, your happiness and sadness, then you should write, write them down, write them out, write them as they come, as they go, as they hide from you, appears on one day, disappears on another, but still lingering around — yes, write them down, write them down. They are memories, they are more than memories, they are the only material that makes you a worth living life, not because you have achieved much, but because you have endured much, but has not yet given it up, not yet lost the spark you were born with, and still have a sense of, feeling, of love, of tenderness, of agitation and anger, of a lot of sighs, and of some smiles in between, of even laughs — all these, like marks man etches on a rock wall or a wood stick to track time, are the tracks of, you. So, I'll write, more, if I can, whenever I was thinking of you, whenever I take a deep of breath of a fresh air, whenever I take another picture I think it's nice, whenever I have something I want to show you, to talk to you... whenever, I still know, you are there.","tags":"thoughts","url":"https://fengxia41103.github.io/myblog/no%20time.html"},{"title":"Where","text":"I had a dream, so real, that I had you in my arms, and I buried my head in your hair, kissed it, smelled it... oh how much I love you, my dear, how much I miss you.

For the first time in my life, I couldn't tell what was real and what is a dream. For quite a moment I was sitting there on the couch, not knowing what to believe, not knowing how to feel, because it was so real, but it was only a dream. Where are you? Are you safe? Are you having a good time? ... if only I could know where you are now, and how you are doing. You know, I looked up your hometown yesterday.

For how much I yearn to make another link w/ you, w/ your life. If fate is like two threads, I wish ours will interwind again, tie a knot, and never open. So for the wish of this year, I wish, I could see your place, find your footsteps, hear the sound you have heard, breathe the air you have breathed, live the city you have lived, taking pictures as I go, not for memory's sake, but to show you, someday, some way, or to show God when I see him, that, I miss you very much, I love you so dearly that I keep dreaming, a life, that you and I are nearby.","tags":"thoughts","url":"https://fengxia41103.github.io/myblog/where.html"},{"title":"Unpeaceful mind","text":"Though it is a Friday, actually just another Friday in life, in 2019, weather is nice, went to the gym, didn't have much sleep last night since Noah and I had a rough night, but my body felt fine, not tired.. but for some strange reason, my mind, is very disturbed. I sense this strange timing this morning, that wherever I went, I ran into some good looking girl or woman, and happened to be, that we will across each other walking towards the same direction, but w/ them always just a few steps behind me... to me, it is just a very strange feeling that someone walk behind me like that, as if I were being observed. I kept telling myself, don't be such a self-centered person, who really cares about you anyway? Yet, it's just part of me since I was little, that I constantly sense, or imagine, that their attention was on me... well, what else to look at anyway, when there is just someone walking in front of you, and not like walking on the 5th Avenue that you get a lot to check out. Here we are, walking towards office from parking lot, or from bld 7 to bld 8 crossing the 奈何桥, no one but the two of us... it was just, uneasy. Very often, first thing in the morning, you will start to notice a pattern for the day, keeps happening wherever you go, whatever you do. On some days the pattern is good, so you would have a good day; then on others, man, just embrace yourself, and survive. Why so!? I'm not a fatalist at all. But why so, why this pattern, why can I sense it while it seems that others simply don't notice them at all? Are they really just a reflection of your mind on that day, that when you were happy or in a good mood, the sky would be blue regardless what the weather really was!? or, they are indeed external to me, existing independently. Though my mood would influence my perception of the blue sky, it can only tint it, not change it? or can it change it altogether? I don't know. But this morning I have this strange feeling that something is off. Noah is really struggling w/ his homework — the kid spent 2 hours working on one single math problem out of a lesson's practice, which has 7 problems on a double side A4! ← and he didn't even get that problem right! wt heck!.... then, he didn't get to bed till 1 o'clock in the morning!!!!.... isn't this crazy or what!... what's up w/ him? I tried all kinds of persuasion, father-and-son chat, punishment, encouragement, even played checker last night after dinner just to relax the mood and give the kid a break... none worked. Disappointing, indeed. I don't know what else I could help this kid to understand that study is like his swim training, is like the theme of the hare & tortoise story → perseverance. He might have been born w/ a brain of a hare. But his race against his peers have just been another hare's race, also — he got distracted left and right, and he is not far behind all the tortoises. I hate how Chinese parents use the analogy of a race to describe how kids are competing each other even when they were first born, so called 输在起跑线上, I thought that's completely BS, and I had felt lucky for Noah that I could give him an environment in which he would not be put in such a position to endure such nonsense. Oh well, so I have failed miserably. Not only he didn't appreciate the privilege, but he failed to take advantage of the head start, and refuses to grow up. I can't say it is very disappointing, because I have to remind myself that it is unfair to him to impose my expectation upon him. But I have to say, he is letting me down, he is letting himself down. I really don't care whether he wins the race at all, because I really don't care how all the other kids are doing comparing to him. Yet, he is not doing well. Not at all. He is becoming a worse person than before, and I don't know how to stop him from becoming so. Maybe the truth of my uneasy mind this morning, is that, I'm disappointed of myself. Not only I have lost the battle of marriage, of happiness, but now have lost the battle of parenthood, of making a happy kid and a smart son. So that's what really is, a LOSER, written in capital, indeed.","tags":"thoughts","url":"https://fengxia41103.github.io/myblog/unpeaceful%20mind.html"},{"title":"S.T.E.M","text":"Finally, I learned what is S.T.E.M — S cience, T echnology, E ngineering, M ath, and here is a slashdot opinion on why we still need an English major. I can't agree more. I believe we are living in an era in which science, technology, development, progress are being hailed as the new gospel. As if they bring no burden but only solve the existing problem, we treat them as a free lunch while each one of us are well versed that there is no free lunch, of any kind, ever. Instead, they are wonderful but not magical; they solve things while creating new issues — it's the natural course of progress, of course, but they shouldn't be set in an altar. On the contrary, I think we need more debates on its responsibility and its role in the society . Education, another buzz word that is forever on any adult's mind regarding their children and their awesome future , is becoming another window dressing that can be used to promote and propogate these trends (or, should I just call them, fads!?) so that they are deemed holly, thus immune from attacks, criticism, or even doubt. But if one takes one step back to look at what is occupying the mind of the media, thus the crowds, one has to wonder that on the one hand why the society is so diverse, thus becoming impossible to manage, and on the other, so synchronized, that herd effect is seen everywhere, all the time, in every country, some better, some worse, but just the same. Why!? When I first went to BU, the slogan of its \"arts and science\" seemed rather strange to my ears — grantedly I was all about STEM back then, arts, huh, who needs arts? I was never able to understand much of the arts, though honestly I tried. So to me back then the idea of arts w/ science is like marrying arts up to a prince, or down marry of a prince to Dianna, not from the same league, but w/ some love in the scene, sure. But more and more I start to appreciate the power, the beauty, the necessity of arts. I forced myself to read Dr. Zhivago since I liked that movie very much, just to have a starting point of reading novel. I am still struggling w/ arts, though I have long been in love with music, many kinds, really, almost like women — there is always someone you find appealing, interesting, tempting, even beautiful, among any crowd — so is music, on a given day, there might be a tune on your mind, and can vibrate a chord in your heart, and make you cry. Yes, we need arts, we need English major, we need writers, need poets, need these people not only because their creation touches us, but they often have such a deep perception of human, of the society, of the era, that when captured in word, in painting, in movie, in tune, becomes crystalized, preserved for ages, don't get old, don't become obsolete, hardly even become irrelevant or weak, because it's the human core they have penetrated, have the eyes and ears to see and hear, have skill to describe, have the desire to share, have the courage to face. STEM and English majors, are sense, and sensibility.","tags":"thoughts","url":"https://fengxia41103.github.io/myblog/stem.html"},{"title":"Jira","text":"Jira is, tough. I have been searching a solution to make my Jira life easy. The problems I want to fix are: Loading browser is too slow ← how many times I just want to get a view of the comment or description so to refresh my memory. Navigating from one ticket to another is to open a new tab, but that just clutter my browser. Very soon I don't remember which tab is for which ticket, so ended up openning the same jira over and over. To switch its status is again, to load page, click some kind of dropdown, then click to select → 3 clicks. No, I already know what status I want it to be, so I want to simplify this. #3 also applies to reassign a ticket to someone — there are usually only a handful ppl you deal w/ on a daily basis during development. Instead of waiting for the spinning wheel to come up the name, just memorize the user's name, and assign. This is actually the very first reason got me to look into an alternative solution than using a browser — create ticket is very tedious! I dislike filling that form very much. Again, usually I already know the value I want to use, so a cheat was to clone an existing one. But then, finding an adequate existing one is time consuming also. So again, to simplify this is a big win. Filters. Too many times there are this view, that view — I want to see all my stories, or all my bugs, or just high priority bugs, or just the ones created today, or all bugs associated w/ the theme I'm working on because I need to coordinate developers on the work.... the list goes on and on, and I know, there is the filter, which is nothing but a web version of the JQL query. So why the hassle of creating a whole bunch of filters, then the browser takes a long time to load, and that filter gives you a long list of fields you can display! But hell, I only care a few fields which the team uses, so even to hunt down the fields that is useful to me is time consuming. I want to use the JQL and a list of fields that has valuable info, no more, no less. So the journey goes w/ a weekend try starting w/ org-jira , which looked very promising! I thought it would also be a good way to learn org-mode. But hell, the org-mode itself is really slow! Just a small org file of my bugs make the entire emacs choking to death. WTF! Long story short. Here is the go-jira , incredibly fast, and useful! It's a command line ( download here ), just copy it to /usr/local/bin and type jira help : ╰─➤ jira help usage: jira [ <flags> ] <command> [ <args> ... ] Jira Command Line Interface Global flags: --help Show context-sensitive help ( also try --help-long and --help-man ) . -v, --verbose ...

It uses YAML template to handle all the data posting back to the Jira server. Thus, you are dealing w/ a list of yaml files to tweak what data fields you want to use in an action. But two most useful ones are: table and create . table template This is the primary table template to display a list of things, the same idea in jira browser when you on a list view. Since this is to display on a terminal, nothing fancy is required, just straightforward string to compose a table look. The key to success is to: know what fields are available some knowledge of this strange hugo syntax . It's quite like Jinja2, the concept is the same, just different syntax. One thing I find useful is its functions , so you can do a bit of extra in the template. But overall, writing template is not pleasant, but it's a one-time deal, so it's ok. What it looks like is pretty slick! → ╰─➤ jira cp - bug - mine 1 ↵ | OL - 3228 | QA_1910 : User management section incorrectly r ... | B | In T | fxia1 | M | 19 days | OL - 3482 | Nav area font is not high contrast enough | B | Sele | fxia1 | M | 4 days | OL - 3453 | Storage HA failed notification - contact info ... | B | Sele | fxia1 | M | 6 days | OL - 3342 | QA_1910_chat box icon is not visible in login ... | B | Sele | fxia1 | M | 14 days | OL - 3327 | QA_1910 : Shut Down failed for application inst ... | B | In P | fxia1 | H | 14 days | OL - 3326 | QA_1910 : Chat support box is grey 'ed out | B | In P | fxia1 | H | 14 days | OL - 3241 | QA_1910 : Lenovo EULA in create account page s ... | B | In P | fxia1 | H | 19 days | OL - 3560 | QA_1910_Empty extra cell in Network Reosurces | B | Back | fxia1 | M | a day | OL - 3552 | QA_1910 - Cloud controller version is displaye ... | B | Back | fxia1 | H | a day | OL - 3551 | QA_1910 - User guide page is not loaded with ... | B | Back | fxia1 | M | a day | OL - 3549 | QA_1910_Shows cloudistics fav icon for a second | B | Back | fxia1 | M | a day | OL - 3548 | QA_1910_Lenovo cloud market place filter by l ... | B | Back | fxia1 | M | a day | OL - 3546 | QA_1910_change filter by label color | B | Back | fxia1 | M | a day | OL - 3545 | QA_1910 : The Lenovo logo from main login page ... | B | Back | fxia1 | M | a day | OL - 3544 | QA_1910 : The links to User guide and Legal In ... | B | Back | fxia1 | M | a day | OL - 3532 | QA_1910 - Chat box chat information is displa ... | B | Back | fxia1 | M | a day | OL - 3530 | QA_1910_Texts are not visible in calendar pop ... | B | Back | fxia1 | M | a day | OL - 3328 | QA_1910 : Error message received while performi ... | B | Back | fxia1 | H | 14 days | OL - 3270 | QA_1910 : Trouble downloading multiple templat ... | B | Back | fxia1 | H | 15 days | OL - 3214 | QA_1910 : Can filter info storage having only ... | B | Back | fxia1 | M | 20 days | OL - 3205 | QA_1910 : Invalid port range error message dis ... | B | Back | fxia1 | H | 20 days | OL - 3204 | QA_1910 : An error appears in top right corner ... | B | Back | fxia1 | M | 20 days | OL - 3201 | QA_1910 : Unable to restart windows Instance | B | Back | fxia1 | H | 20 days | OL - 3198 | QA_1910 : No text appears in the white borders ... | B | Back | fxia1 | M | 20 days | OL - 3183 | QA_1910 : Inconsistent behavior when assign a V ... | B | Back | fxia1 | M | 21 days | OL - 3182 | QA_1910 : The window that pops out when user ad ... | B | Back | fxia1 | L | 21 days | OL - 3117 | QA_1910_ 'verify phone number page' lenovo Log ... | B | Back | fxia1 | M | 27 days create template This is to display a YAML file for you to fill in the blanks. This is where you can plugin all kinds of hardcoded values to save time. It's pretty self-explanatory, so take a look . I don't know much about the hugo yet, so most of the contents here are just basics. jira server, username In config.yml , just define these: endpoint : https://jira1.labs.company.com:8443 user : fxia1 It will prompt you for password when it tries to connect. Somehow it saves (cookie?) so that once you have authenticated, your CLI works without asking the password again for a while (good a whole day in my situation). I haven't found an option where I can save the pwd, like .authinfo . Small inconvenience. custom commands This is really a life-saver, unbelievably powerful! You just define a JQL, and it becomes just another command! Example: custom-commands : - name : mine help : Display issues assigned to me script : >- {{jira}} list --template table --query \" assignee=currentUser() AND status not in (DONE,CANCELED) ORDER BY issuetype ASC, status DESC, created DESC, key DESC \" This says to use the table template for display, and the query string is the just whatever you want to speak to jira server. Also by using the >- to handle yaml multiline string , we can type the query in any nice indented format you like, and it will be converted into a single string by removing all the newlines in between w/ a single white space! Slick, isn't it!? With this, you can really just learn the JQL and fly w/ your knowledge. The entire jira server is up for your grab at this point. Of course you can just copy & paste your filter's SQL query string from Jira brower to here! To give you an idea what it can do, here are the filters I'm using: cp-story: All CP stories cp-bug: All CP bugs cp-story-mine: My CP stories cp-bug-mine: My CP bugs cp-mine: Everything of CP that is assigned to me cp-done: CP done items cp-unassigned: CP unassigned items If I'm really interested the look, I can give it different --template <whatever> to customize that experience. But as of today, I really want to a consistent view, the same view, for all the tables, so I save on context switching looking at different look for each filter (which I found very annoying, and no value add in term of information, whatsoever). editor Set in config.yml . I think it uses whatever the default editor is. I tried nano and for now, using emacsclient will simply reuse the existing emacs session and opens a new buffer! → makes editing YAML so much more pleasant. And it is definitely better than typing in browser's small text box! commands These are the ones I use the most: command description jira mine list everything assigned me jira today-mine everything created today an assigned to me jira any shortcut you defined jira comment OL-1234 make a comment jira view OL-1234 view a ticket jira create -p OL create a ticket for project \"OL\" jira view OL-1234 -t debug check what fields are available/useful jira transitions available transition values jira transition \" \" OL- move along the workflow jira take OL- assign it to myself jira give OL- give it to him/her jira done OL- mark it DONE So far, soooooooooooooooooooooooo good ~~~~~","tags":"dev","url":"https://fengxia41103.github.io/myblog/jira.html"},{"title":"Linux Terminator cheatsheet","text":"Key Description Ctrl+Shift+X Toggle between showing all terminals and only showing the current one.

First of all, don't use xrandr --outout <whatever> --scale 0.5x0.5 . This will only decrease the resolution, which makes the screen/font blurry! Instead, there are two things you need to do: Add these to .Xresources (if file doesn't exist, create one). Play w/ the Xft.dpi value ← the smaller the value, the smaller the font will be (you can check by evoking i3wm's menu bar WIN+d ). No idea what the other values are. Then logout and log back in, you will be super happy! ```shell Xft.dpi: 200 Xft.autohint: 0 Xft.lcdfilter: lcddefault Xft.hintstyle: hintfull Xft.hinting: 1 Xft.antialias: 1 Xft.rgba: rgb ``` Use xdpyinfo to check screen resolution 1 : On X1 gen 8, it's shown 2560x1440 pixels (677x381 millimeters) . Set dpi=180 gives the same exp/size as what was on gen 4 without any tweaking. On Flex pro, it gives 3840 x 2160 , use dpi=200 is good; 180 is too small.

Now go to myblog/template/feng/static , and run bower install . zsh Follow this blog , and you will get a cool looking shell: git clone https://github.com/robbyrussell/oh-my-zsh.git ~/.oh-my-zsh cp ~/.oh-my-zsh/templates/zshrc.zsh-template ~/.zshrc change theme in .zshrc to ZSH_THEME=\"agnoster\" Set zsh as the default shell: chsh -s /bin/zsh git clone https://github.com/zsh-users/zsh-syntax-highlighting.git \"$HOME/.zsh-syntax-highlighting\" --depth 1 echo \"source $HOME/.zsh-syntax-highlighting/zsh-syntax-highlighting.zsh\" >> \"$HOME/.zshrc\" If you want to revert back to bash: chsh -s /bin/bash . sshfs Use this to mount another machine's file system into your local. This is a great way to share the same code between your localhost and vms. apt install sshfs Uncomment user_allow_other in /etc/fuse.conf . to mount: sshfs -o allow_other fengxia@192.168.1.112:/home/fengxia/workspace ./tmp ← mount remove workspace/ to your local ./tmp . i3 Under ~/.config , find two folder named i3/ and i3status . Copy i3.conf to i3/config , and i3status.confg to i3status/i3status.conf . pandoc Use Pandoc 2.7.3 . The v1.9 in Ubuntu 18.04 didn't work for compiling RA PDF . Read this article for more details of my Pandoc notes. pip install pandoc-fignos apt install pandoc-citeproc texlive-full optional: install mermaid-filter : npm install -g mermaid-filter system tweak In /etc/sysctl.conf , then sysctl -p to reload: increase watcher limit, needed for webpack hot reloading: fs.inotify.max_user_watches=524288 set swappiness to 10: vm.swappiness=10 Reboot, of course, will work, too. clear swap script Create a /usr/local/sbin/swap2ram.sh per this Ubuntu's FAQ, and paste these lines: #!/bin/sh mem = $( LC_ALL = C free | awk '/Mem:/ {print $4}' ) swap = $( LC_ALL = C free | awk '/Swap:/ {print $3}' ) if [ $mem -lt $swap ] ; then echo \"ERROR: not enough RAM to write swap back, nothing done\" > & 2 exit 1 fi swapoff -a && swapon -a Then chmod +x and execute it. It takes a while and has no stdout prints of any kind. You can watch glances that swap % is going down while RAM % is going up, and eventually swap % will be 0!! enterprise stuff Working in an enterprise means that you need a few tools, eg. emails, to work w/ everybody else (which == Microsoft, actually, sigh). for Cisco's Anyconnect vpn: here for emails: mbsync & davmail , or thunderbird . But honestly, setting up Davmail is a lot better, and you can have Thunderbird acting as just an email agent off davmail anyway. for Skype business/Lync: use pidgin . fix a broken upgrade It was a strange experience that by doing do-release-upgrade to 20.04, my X1 didn't have network manager and wicd after! This made it impossible for me to use the wifi. Tried dhclient , iwconfig and so on, no avail. So in the end I learned something quite powerful — by booting into the USB live system, you can swap a few things so that now the OS is running off your installed folder, thus you can do apt-get using the live image (I think it's running in memory) while it will use disk files from your installation! Boot a Ubuntu live CD in \"Try without installing\". Make sure you are connected to the internet. In terminal type: shell sudo mount --bind /dev /<chrootlocation>/dev sudo mount --bind /proc /<chrootlocation>/proc sudo mount --bind /sys /<chrootlocation>/sys sudo cp /etc/resolv.conf /<chrootlocation>/etc/resolv.conf sudo chroot /<chrootlocation> You will need to replace <chrootlocation> with the appropriate location of your Ubuntu install, typically the label of the partition it's installed on. The partition must also be mounted so that you can access it. 3. Edit your /etc/resolve.conf and add at least one nameserver: shell nameserver 8.8.8.8 # Google Public DNS 4. Now you can do the apt update and so on. 5. Exit chroot by simply doing exit in terminal. 6. If you are done, just reboot now .

This discussion/thought had started in 2014 when I was in 太原 and was chatting w/ 谢部 at a Starbucks downstairs near her office. Out of my own experience w/ this type of devices — a 红 米 given by my uncle, then later a new one I bought myself, w/o any previous experience in the States before I went (I insisted using a cheap flip phone back then), thus was forcing myself to use a smart phone with nothing but practical purpose — to communicate w/ family and colleague and customer, to navigate the places completely strange to me, and so on → thus, I consider this experience to be quite fresh and genuine because it has no prefix, nor bias. Besides, considering myself to be a tech person, I didn't expect there would have been much a barrier to adopt the new trend, and enjoy it. But, my opinion was, and still is, that: It is not smart at all. As a matter of fact, the touch screen is quite annoying, and very un-user-friendly! And it is a fad for the time being, but is not the future, because it has an assumption, which I believe is untrue. not smart It's called smart phone simply for marketing reason. In my eyes it is nothing but a computer in disguise, even the first time I heard and saw such thing. I don't understand why people are sooo hailing its invention as if this was a shocking discovery that no one but Jobs had conceived and made it reality. Quite to the contrary. Everything on this device has been invented, implemented, marketed, and failed, on a personal laptop, before. I recall back in probably 2000 or even earlier that Norman Lee was saying he wanted to buy a $2000 laptop w/ touch screen because it would help his Ph.D research presentation w/ colleagues. Myself had also looked at a non-brand-name laptop before buying the Sony one which offered touch screen — which essentially is just a way to tell the mouse where it should be instead of using a touchpad. I was not aware of GPS inside a device. But it's not a far fetch to think they must have existed in such small format in some portal device already — I bet REI must have carried such hiking gadget if I had looked. Hell, I remember there were Casio watch boasting to have compass built in! And for the communication modules — wifi, bluetooth, you name it, they have all been there as a card in desktop, or a smaller card in laptop, or, in the smart phone's case, an even smaller fashion. And there will always be SoC if one is willing to pay the $$. So hardware wise, this is a commercial success instead of an engineering achievement, in my view. Once you realize this is a computer, well, then it is just as smart as any software engineer can make it, no more, no less. As of today, all the things a user does on this phone bears such a distinct mark of a computer user — click, tap, type in a command in some fancy looking search box — this is just as uninteresting as one can be ! Not to mention how awkward software now has to adapt to an army of different resolution, screen size, browser engine.... this is ridiculous! Next time when you think it is smart, you should really make it more accurate that this is a phone programmed by some poor smart software engineer who had ironed out the quirks and put in a gazzilions of try.. except statements so that the code path your usage will traverse is like a tiny proportion comparing to what s/he has done, thus it appears to be super smart, super stable, super thoughtful. When people have been unwilling to adopt a laptop as an everyday toy, they are eagerly embracing the same device only dressed in a different costume. This, says a lot about human and human psyche. poor user interface I really don't like touch screen, at all. The number one annoyance is that people seem not to realize in 99% of the time, the one single control you want to click/tap is occupying like 5% of the screen or less! How many times you have tried to click on that close window cross icon which is not nearly as large as your finger (yeah, finger tip, by its wording, can be just a tiny dot to the infinite smallness, isn't it! This is insane.) Then you have to take a deep breath, focus your mind momentarily, stead your hand, poke, and w/ a bit of luck, to get that icon. How many times you are on the phone, and it touches your cheek, and when you look down to either search for the keypad or mute button, man, it is a screen you don't expect! and you have to leave the phone off your ear so you can see , and trying to fix it, while your mind is going into panic mode because now you might be missing whatever is on the phone the other end is saying! This is ridiculous to the Nth degree! And btw, holding a large square next to your ear looks really strange, especially on woman! I can't believe why women will tolerate such, and some even are proud of their devices. Honestly, this is the opposite of what I understand what a woman will like — don't they like soft, airy, light things!? This device is nothing but the complete opposite of these. How many times half of your screen is taken by the keypad, so when you are typing a long message, especially in paragraph, it becomes very annoying if you want to look back what you just said. Even worse, the WeChat input box is, what, 2 lines of input space!? and people are still spending hours typing into that! This is just utterly disgusting! Really! Sometimes I think, maybe unfairly, but truthful to myself, that whoever designed such input style is just stupid, or is just giving all the users a GIANT MIDDLE FINGER. And for the users who still like it, man, they are just stupid. Period. More on typing. I just read a slashdot that thumb typing is now achieving a good typing speed as if on a real keyboard . Yeah, you can call this a text book example of human adaption to environment. But in my mind, the speed isn't the issue; the error rate is. Just how many times you have been typing away when your mind is flowing, and you had to erase words, wrong letters, over and over again, because, well, that keypad is too small for your elegant finger(tip) that is fat and unprecise ! Typing on these phones always remind me that if I were so good at aiming at that little square which occupies like a tiny bit of the screen, I could have become a real pianist! This, again, is just, ridiculous! it will go away The smart phone won the battle against other smart devices back in 2007 time frame not because it had superior technology ← at the time, two other competitors who also offered user network connections, which is the foundation of everything we rave about a smart phone and its apps, were GPS and regular wifi. GPS was very much applicable to user who spends a lot of time in car; and regular wifi has been there long before the smart phone, and places like MIT not only had an incredible campus network, but students had hacked together the concept of city wifi by volunteering their computers as router so to connect from one hop to the next! So, the only reason phone became the winner is that, people must have a phone out of living necessity — you have to have a phone to call somebody to conduct business and life. That's all it is. If internet calling could have been as cheap and quality as we have today (it was limited both by the infrastructure bandwidth and compression algorithm), regular laptop could have stood a real chance. Anyway. Then, there is an argument that even with the wearing smart devices, it will still require a \"brain\" — a command center that is to coordinate them ← however, to me this is just another sign of the current thinking how computer and program work today. However, it is more likely that individually these distributed computing unit, borrowing the term service , will expose a certain API that can be utilized by whoever wants to use the service, and each handles its own service within — very much like the idea of central government vs. decentralized governing, many of the things can be done by decentralized fashion while there will be certain activities only possible or cost-effective if centrally managed... as a matter of fact, I believe the more computer evolves, the more its interaction with each other will mirror the human society with its benefits and challenges, and certainly the problems which the human society has yet to find a solution. Like how society evolves also, it will naturally start w/ a central command center (kings, lords, leaders), but will inevitably driving towards a distributed governing model, then hit some scenarios that can not be handled individually, thus inviting swinging towards the opposite direction, and then back and forth with endless debates, as what we see in politics, ideologies, today. conclusion There you have it. Smart phone is an interesting device. However, up till today I have yet to find it essential, and far from being impossible to live without. The strongest argument will be about social media, but even on that I have stated a different opinion in this article . Therefore, I really consider myself to be an opponent against all these smart devices in general — in the same vein that I'm suspicious of the word \"intelligent this or that\". There isn't anything magical about them; there are only hours of frustration, abstract modeling, strong assumption of usage, more test and code paths than any one user can possibly exceed, and unbelievable peer pressure that when your friends are using this app, that phone, you (think) you must have it, too. Instead of viewing them as a technology achievement, it is more interesting as a social experiment which reveals and manifest human's inner desire, fear, anxiety, and like.","tags":"thoughts","url":"https://fengxia41103.github.io/myblog/smart%20phone.html"},{"title":"What we know is untrue","text":"Dutch resistence fighter hearing the news of the WWII victory The more we read, the more I think, the more I start to realize how many of things I know, are untrue. This, is disturbing. Reading the America and Americans by John Steinbeck, I was rarely touched by a book because it spells so many points which I feel, I think, and agree. This is a great book with great insights, and are honest about the past and the present (as of 1966). Indeed, so many things we have learned, thought to be the case, are not so. America and Americans are full of paradox — the early settlers lived with full intent not to mix with anyone who is unlike themselves, by religion, by race, by land of origin, by whatever the moral compass they held dear . Yet, this country becomes the most diversified mixing pots of everything, normal and eccentric, ordinary and extraordinary, mediocre and polarized. Fascinating. So here I'm going to document things of the untrue: woman lives longer than man, polygamy Women, by nature's choice, is to bear children, which put a tremendous tax on her body. Also, rearing the young is not an easy task, which women played a dominating role historically, which also didn't help to stretch her life long. Thus, until recent medical advance, women have had a shorter life span than men! Never thought of this. Doesn't this also explain polygamy, that as a natural tendency of balancing risk, just the same that the poorer a family is, the more kids they have, because of a poor survival rate? Also, that can explain why men was marrying women younger than he was — again, another measure against the commonality of her short life. Well, I'm taking John's statement blindly. I'll be interested in seeing some evidence/research on this topic whether this is true. Nonetheless, this is quite an interesting possibility. how to raise a child I have been puzzled by the unarguable recognition that we should leave a better world for our children because they are born to deserve it. I have even argued in this article that this way of putting children as the crown jewel of an adult's life and the society's most important asset has created a strong incentive for the mass shooters to choose school as his (well, so far I have only heard men doing this) target so to maximize his damage. I know this is a difficult challenge because, not only myself is a parent and I have grown to accept this view, but the alternative will be natural selection, in which case who can say me or Noah will be a survivor? Then what? However, it's also a common knowledge that two generation ago, children were born in batches, and they were viewed as, children — we recognize every pitfall his/her ignorance can cause, and guard against them fiercely by parental punishment, peer pressure, school discipline, social norm, and law. But now, they are revered as semi-God, and they were given the task to realize our unfulfilled dream as if they are magician ← this is a great bet, indeed! We cast a net broadly, and once a while we get a lucky hit, and it doesn't have to be your kid. But we parents all bet, and hope for being the power ball winner, because it does happen, all the time. What do you call this, craziness? or, love? I never thought hope, being also in Pandora's box, can actually just another evil, not a savor God give to human out of sympathy of all others released from that box.","tags":"thoughts","url":"https://fengxia41103.github.io/myblog/what%20we%20know%20is%20untrue.html"},{"title":"Middleschool","text":"Watching Noah to do homework these days is like watching paint dry — a true challenge of patience, and the result is often very disastrous. His mom decides to work with him , but by my observation, it's more or a less a shouting contest, and Noah showed a strong sign of rebellion. It makes me both happy because I know he is going into his teens and is on the track of his development, and mad because his rebellious attitude, to his mom in particular, has been there since young, and I worry whether he is also doing so at school, which then will not abide well w/ others... and, is this why he is having difficulty to make friends? I have been deliberately skipping to walk him to bus last few days cause I wanted to give him his own room to meet and chat w/ his bus friends. But I also know that before long I won't be part of his routine and life anymore even if I want to join — the option window is closing, and it's a sure defeat whether I like it or not. Isn't the word defeat the theme of my life these days? — everything is slipping away, youth, hair, energy, ambition, my son, my belief in love, hope in life, passion in another human being... sad, isn't it!? The only thing I'm still having is curiosity, but even that is becoming an issue because the more I read and think and write here, the oftener I'm finding myself to be annoyed by shallow thoughts, superficial comments, BS views, single-minded opinions, groundless preference and belief (if you can call that a belief, which I think the word is being abused to describe something much weaker than a real belief), pride, and prejudice.... indeed, even by sitting here and watching office people now lining up in front of the Starbucks, I can't help wondering whether this becomes an office ritual or an excuse to step away from desk and chat... maybe both. At least here it doesn't bear the overblown role of being a social status icon — drinking Starbucks is a necessity now in China to be viewed as a youth, especially if you have an office life of some sort. But not to ignore that it does have its practical function when your daily commute involves hours of standing in a crowded subway, and waking up in early hours and sleep in late either because you need time to rewind, or just out of habit to be on social media till late at night — either way, the young age affords you the level of energy and resillience to not feel the effect, for a while, until it all catch up w/ you during a day of your low tide, or just like me, when you are getting old. I digged up the old photo of myself when I was also in 6th grade, just as Noah's age and status. Surprisingly I thought I looked a lot older and maturer than what the reality really was ← here I was, squatting in the front row as a 三好学生, yet I looked just like Noah today, probably not even so — honestly I think Noah possesses a more mature feeling than I was. How interesting! So I guess Noah isn't too, childish, after all, as I have imagined, and this may also mean that he will be just fine, and will be better than I am. The other night I told him I hated when my parents compared me to some other kids, and then, Noah cried. I have never seen him so upset. Then he said \"if you don't like that, why are you comparing me to others?\" Hard question. I noticed it that there isn't an alternative if I want to get a sense how he is doing, I mean, what is the reference here!? At that moment, I told him that he can either tell me more himself so I can get the information, which essentially is to use himself, him of yesterday, as the reference, or it leaves me no choice but to find an external reference, which is another kid.. but deep down I also know this is a paradox, a logic that is self-contradicting, and is unfair to him.... But, what should I do? I don't know. Maybe I should just buckle up, ride w/ him, however he is going to become, and pray.","tags":"thoughts","url":"https://fengxia41103.github.io/myblog/middleschool.html"},{"title":"Snapshot anything w/ Selenium","text":"In my previous notes on analyzing Angular 1.x code , I have stuck at how to create snapshots of rendered components for my documentation purpose. In the manual data file .json , I allowed an entry to plug in snapshot file taken by human testers. As an example, the code below shows a block documenting: module: mwc.mapping its components as a LIST, and each has a key screenshot that is a path to the snapshot file. { \"components\" : [ { \"source file\" : \"../app/topology/components/mappings.component.ts\" , \"name\" : \"mwc-mappings\" , \"screenshot\" : \"./screenshots/mwc-mappings.png\" , \"used by\" : null , \"using\" : [ \"mwc-create-flash-pool-button\" , \"mwc-flash-pool-actions-button\" , \"mwc-create-migration-zone-button\" , \"mwc-migration-zone-actions-button\" ], \"class\" : \"MappingsComponent\" } ], \"module\" : \"mwc.mappings\" }, Well, this gets me going to create the example doc , but to have human hunting down screenshots always give me a fishy feeling — you know how deeply I do not trust human to be exhaustive and deterministic — on a good day or w/ a capable person, yes, you get a pretty satisfactory result, but even then, it's no guarantee his/her next day's delivery will be the same. Not to mention, executing a task such as \"finding all the HTML tag matching this pattern, and take a screenshot of it, and save it here, and update the file here...\" is tedious, boring, and no fun ← I would hate to do something like this, not even for once, certainly not for 10th time or daily. Computer can do this, a lot better, quicker. After all, the component has been written and computer is rendering it for human to look at, then why can't computer just capture the look of it automatically? Of course it can. The idea is this: Use Selenium to launch a browser. Use XPATH to select the element(s) you want. Enumerate through the element, determine where to save the file — file path, file name convention. element.snapshot(file_path) will write to file_path onto the file system. Window on the right hand side is monitoring folder on the file system for screenshots. It starts w/ an empty directory. Window on the top left is the terminal where you will see printout from the script when it finds the interested element and takes its snapshot, eg. smile: mwc-support-mode-modal . Window on the bottom left is the browser window launched by Selenium which gives you an idea how the computer is working. The browser is shown only for demo purpose. It can be turned into headless mode. context One thing of taking snapshot is to provide a context to viewer — in which page/panel/container this component is being used. Believe or not, some components I'm dealing w/ is nothing but a small green dot (see below)! Therefore, it will be pretty useless if I'm just giving you an image of itself. Example of an element becoming much more meaningful when given a context than only by itself. On the other hand, by taking the snapshot of a higher level element and use a RED square to highlight your target, you have a context of its usage. The trick is to use the ancestor axes in XPATH. Say we are to search any HTML tag starts with feng : target_xpath = \"*[starts-with(local-name(), 'feng-')]\" , then I want to find its context matching the same HTML tag pattern: ancestor_xpath = \"ancestor::%s[position()=1]\" % target_xpath . snapshot in a context Taking snapshot to illustrate a context thus taking two steps: Take a snapshot of the context element, eg. an ancestor, and save the file. Open this file, and using Python Image Library to draw a rectangle using the location and size of your target element. Example of a code snippet is shown below. Note that you must adjust the element c location based on the ancestor's because once we took a snapshot of the ancestor, its origin becomes the new (0,0) . # looking for the first ancestor matching the xpath ancestor_xpath = \"ancestor:: %s [position()=1]\" % context ancestors = c . find_elements_by_xpath ( ancestor_xpath ) if ancestors : parent = ancestors [ 0 ] # take snapshot of the ancestor if not self . _take_snapshot ( parent , filename ): continue # draw a red rectangle around this component with Image . open ( filename ) as im : draw = ImageDraw . Draw ( im ) x1 = int ( c . location [ \"x\" ]) - int ( parent . location [ \"x\" ]) y1 = int ( c . location [ \"y\" ]) - int ( parent . location [ \"y\" ]) x2 = x1 + int ( c . size [ \"width\" ]) y2 = y1 + int ( c . size [ \"height\" ]) draw . rectangle ( [( x1 , y1 ), ( x2 , y2 )], outline = \"red\" , width = 3 ) del draw im . save ( filename ) else : self . _take_snapshot ( c , filename ) dropdown menu Dropdown is tricky. You don't see the dropdown menu unless user clicks. However, like the green dot example above, it's not meaningful you only show the trigger because many times it's only an icon (not even a button w/ text!). So depending on how dropdown is being implemented in your code, you have to think of a way to open the dropdown, and take a snapshot of it together w/ its trigger : An example of dropdown menu whose trigger is only a small icon. Thus by programmatically open the dropdown, we can take a snapshot of the menu and the trigger together, giving it a context. modal dialog An example of modal dialog half-rendered when we don't wait for its visibility. Modals are evil! There are many challenges: We need to identify it's trigger pattern ← what can trigger a modal to appear. In many cases the modal trigger code is already attached to DOM, but is invisible. So XPATH can pick them up, but element.click() will fail. Instead, use the brute force way to click: driver.execute_script(\"arguments[0].click();\", element) . Modal dialog takes time to become present in DOM and visible . You have to wait for both. Waiting only for presence will give a snapshot that the modal is half gray-ed out because it is still in the process of rendering ← this is the difference between a human and a computer — computer can take the snapshot much quicker than human can even though the element is not yet _humanly visible (but is already perfectly valid because it has attached to DOM!). Modal is often used to prompt user for an action with common option of do sth or cancel . In our snapshot effort, I don't want to change anything in the application, but only for the loop of a modal. Thus, we should trigger it to appear, and always click the CANCEL ! We deliberately ignore Modal's context because a popup usually takes over the entire screen asset (w/ a gray-ed out background over the original page), thus is viewed as a stand-alone entity anyway. And another good news — modal can not be nested. Thus, we are only dealing one at a time (if we religiously clicked the CANCEL each time!). code Script is here . installation chrome driver apt search chromedriver , then install the one you found: on Ubuntu 16.04: apt install chromedriver on Ubuntu 18.04: apt install chromium-chromedriver firefox webdriver (aka. geckodriver) export GV = v0.25.0 wget \"https://github.com/mozilla/geckodriver/releases/download/ $GV /geckodriver- $GV -linux64.tar.gz\" tar xvzf geckodriver- $GV -linux64.tar.gz chmod +x geckodriver sudo cp geckodriver /usr/local/bin/","tags":"dev","url":"https://fengxia41103.github.io/myblog/snapshot%20selenium.html"},{"title":"Emotional AI","text":"While at gym, the thought just came to me, that all the talks about AI have been about how it will obsolete human and jobs, how much acceleration it travels in term of cracking the challenges we throw at it/them, therefore how much we will be behind once the AI train passes us — louder, louder, louder.. and it's, gone! and we will never catch up again, ever. Then the world will be dominated by AI and its creations (robots?), and human, likely will become slaves, or like in the Matrix, some sort of utilitarian object, fertilizer, maybe. Then, the talks inevitably lead to gaps that AI can not yet do, and even argue that they will never able to. Two common threads — language, and emotion. Language that there are too much subtlety in our conversation (and the Chinese especially think they are the master of such, in their eyes, arts, in my eyes, annoyance, see my elaboration on irresponsible response ), that AI/computer is yet to understand that much depth — Siri and its siblings are essentially a converter with the Google search engine standing behind as the backend ← they convert audio into a string, POST to the search engine, and read back the results. Then, the culprit of human dignity always ends on emotion — AI/computer is viewed as an autistic kid, the rain man, they are super smart, good at math, but they have no emotion. Too bad, therefore, they can't become human, they will never match human, because emotion is the crown jewel of human activity such as music, art, reading a book, falling in love, dream, hope, imagination (the book I was reading in Ray's ICU was about how human can develop intelligence, and the root argument is that emotion is the enabler for a human to develop those cold-blood capabilities — logic, critical thinking, and so on.) Since human emotion are too complex to be modeled, therefore AI can't yet, and unlikely ever will, develop such, what should we call it, skill? trait?... anyway, so they won't never have emotion, thus human still wins (at least it will be a 1:1 replacement). But . Not only in my AI , I have described two ways to measure a duck: they quack in the same way a duck does → open mouth, vibrate vocal chord in frequency ABC, inhale, and so on and on..., or they make a sound, however they generate them, but it came out like a quack. If you can't tell the result, does the process to get there matter? But also, I think there is another gap in this discussion that so far no one has ever touched up — if AI acquires human emotion (let's just take to the extreme, not even human like, but human identical!), what will they be!? This, becomes interesting. 1 unreliable The No.1 advantage of computer isn't even its processing power — it's its predictability! It can crunch the number as fast as it will. It will still be competely useless if the same inputs generate different results every single run! So, what will emotion do to it? I think everyone can answer this pretty easily. Every one of us is a human, and we are emotional. By being emotional, we have good days and bad days. Asking a colleague or a manager to review your work is a hit or miss if this person is, say, super emotional (well, the extreme case of an emotional person will be some insanity, isn't it!?). That's exactly why we take the pain to codify the thoughts into computer program, into some software controlled mechanics, so that its move, its decision making, and its results, are predictable . Therefore, will an emotional AI still be, as powerful and almighty as we are now imagining? It will be powerful in the sense of its sheer processing power. But it can't be a good thing at all, because it's like giving Trump the nuclear weapon launch code and he can send them off anytime he wants — on a bad morning he might just do it! So it will like living w/ a emotional God, or, to ask anyone who is still hanging on in an unhappy marriage, it's just, misery. philosophy Now, when a group of these emotional AIs get together, do they form a community just like we do? do they then also bump into each other like neighbours living in a crowded compound? Even better, do they then develop the same confusion and frustration, thus producing philosophy? What about happiness? that's a kind of emotion, isn't it? and Love? Oh mine, that must be a slipper slop that no one has the answer. So this world of emotional AI can go on and on, and the more you think of it, the more you will imagine that they will behave, live, co-live, very much like what we are doing, in a different scales and different styles, maybe, but the fundamental questions, the philosophical questions, that human have been developing since Socrates and onwards, will inevitably become the same challenge for them... hmmm, I will be curious to see whether their super brain can create some super philosophy or philosophers, what will that be like? Anyway. I don't think emotion is the last line of defense of human against these machines. On the contrary, following this train of thought, it's more of a poison pill that you want the AI to actively swallow, so you blunt their No.1 value proposition — predictability, bring them down the same level of emotional turmoils we are experience, and lead them into the infinite thinking process of philosophy and, even religion... what a fun! I'll be using the word AI and computer interchangeably. ↩","tags":"thoughts","url":"https://fengxia41103.github.io/myblog/emotional%20ai.html"},{"title":"Rebranding","text":"Rebranding is a common task.

Exclusion has a default list to exclude all binary formats, eg. .png . Open the file as text file, search line by line whether interested pattern in found. If found, log down the file full path, line number, and original line text. Identify reference , which is defined as /<.....> — this covers reference to a URL or an external file.

The goal is to create a lookup/catalogue between code and visual because everyone on the team, including UI devs, can only engage a discussion using the visual (the rendered look) — so far, I haven't been able to develop the capability to see how it will look like by just staring at code. This issue gets compounded when components are calling each other — some pages are calling all kinds of components, and these components are in turn used in all sorts of parent pages. This presents an issue how to knows its effect when, say, I'm taking a task to change this component? Without such a cross reference, I'm completely in the dark. Think about this, if component A is used in 3 places, we should have 3 test cases just to be sure it doesn't break the visual. This leads me to a google search and I think the term for what I'm thinking is visual regression . I'm surprised to see how new this concept appears to be by looking at how young a few mentioned libraries/services are. Maybe I'm just behind the curve. Nonetheless, here I am, and I'm catching up, fast. jest-image-snapshot mentions of saving snapshot in some dir — maybe I can use this to get a snapshot of component. But it's saving them for future comparison purpose, which I'm not ready yet to embark this level of testing. So keep the notes here for now. My way is extremely hacky because I'm going to parse .ts file using Python regex. So embrace yourself. how to find module definition Module is the core grouping method in Angular: export .... module('module.name') export .... angular.module('module.name') Pretty straightforward, two variations. how to find component definition Component is messy. Just how many ways one can define a component? export const A: IComponentOptions class A implements ng.IOnInit class A implements angular.IOnInit export class A , just a plain class export const A = { component hierarchy Strategy of getting component call chain is to parse HTML file. This relies on a certain naming convention, eg. all your tags are prefixed with feng- so that HTHM parser will pick up any tags with this prefix, and identify inside which HTML tree this is being used, thus formulating a hierarchy. utility Script is maintained here . pip install click lxml to create .md : python code_analysis.py build-doc --manual-data webapp.json --dump-md-to webapp.md --template-header header.md This will parse webapp.json as an input, and merge w/ machine scanned version created by walk the code tree for all .ts and .html files. The merged data set will be written back to webapp.json , and create a Pandoc version of webapp.md ready for conversion to .html and other formats. to find missing screenshots: check-screenshots --data <data>.json example doc Once you piece these together, you can get a really impressive doc by producing a Pandoc .md . Also, you can dump data into .json or .yml for machine parsing and to incorporate manual generated data such as screenshot (as of writing 9/4/2019, we are relying on human to take screenshot by painfully finding the component rendered in a browser).

A few mixed thoughts have been lingering around my mind for quite some. But they are rather elusive — they come and go, and on the moment when I felt them, I was always busy with something else. Then by the time I sat down to write, I couldn't think of them anymore. So let me try them again. This is a topic I have long been writing, that I think the internet is in trouble. What's the value of the Internet these days? I used to think, and I think most people will take it as the No. 1 value of the Internet, is that it has made information ( not knowledge, and leave alone truth, fact, reality, those kind of words ) readily available at your finger tip. But then, we do have to ask, what is the use of information? The answer will be, it depends — certainly an information of the a sale going on in a McDonald's next door will not help you in any way when your son is sick and you need to figure out how to get him to a Doctor. I mean, measured by a particular moment, the value of information is depending on the prioritized need at that moment — you might still find the sale useful cause you also think of your lunch or a snack for your son on the way to the hospital. However, it is less useful because seeing a Doctor has higher priority. It's on this usefulness of information that people would think of the Internet as a tool. But I think there are two issues here. First, assuming that the information is 100% accurate and whole — meaning it is true to the extent anyone on this earth can possibly perceive to include, and what is included is as correct as anyone on this earth can possibly validate. Even so, the degree of the usefulness varies tremendously from case to case. Let me try to rank the causes of such variation: How the question is formulated. I'm a firm believer of garbage in, garbage out. I often say that Google may have everything you will ever want to know. How much yo*u are getting out it is solely depending on your question → the more pinpointed your question is, the more likely you will find search results helpful to answer your question. How well is the information relating to your question. An easy example will be those double-meaning words — the speaker may not even be aware of its ambiguity while the question is asked. Then, how could the Internet respond well? How well can the receiver use the feedbacks. This is completely a personal trait, and is what makes one a good/bad engineer/student/person, and so on. It's the point #2 that I want to elaborate further, and is what I mean by the degradation of the Internet's value. Reading over the articles circulating in the friendship circle has long taught us that it will be a nonsense to believe everything the Internet presents to us. One can argue that objetive info such as a selling price of a product you searched from Google or Amazon is reliable, while a personal relationship of a movie star with whom and whom is nothing but gossips. But, how do you know? In other words, what makes that price info not a gossip (if we let these words, \"info\" and \"gossip\", bear the distinction of a \"accurate/truthful info\" vs. \"untruthful/inaccurate info\")? By a sheer logic, I would not think there is such a measure/criteria at all one can utilize to identify one from another (well, one could also argue that each person is himself the measure, which is also true in a day-to-day sense), because there is nothing objective about the target (these info) and the act (to distinguish them). Everything in this discussion is purely, subjective. And once we agree that they are in the subjective sphere, all bets are off — I can say whatever I want, and you can hear whatever you like — it's a fair game for all, and unfair for all, too. Then, what's the value of the Internet anymore than other information channels we have — your eyes, ears, newspapers, TVs, pamphlets, bibles or any other book, lecture by your professor or by your parents, a tale, a piece of history — Internet is just another channel, grantedly much more efficient, and also much more free because it does not obey geo boundary, thus is transcending not only geo bounds, but social bounds, custom bounds, ideological bounds → and why so!? how so!? Why can't, say, an internationally distributed newspaper, achieve the same effect (let's leave out censorship out to simplify the discussion)? One difference I can think of is that those medias are produced by a single entity, the owner company of that media, while whatever is circulating on the Internet is taken to be generated by an unknown entity, a group of unknown entities. But apparently, these anonymous authors didn't make the material any more credible than those known authors. As a matter of fact, the contrary is becoming true, that people are more and more believing those official channels (and the worst example is to quote government releases as the ultimate source of truth) more than a piece you pick up on the Internet. So, the democracy feature of the Internet's information flow is actually working against itself by making it less and less valuable as an information source! Efficiency. Yes, the Internet still holds this edge due to its underline technology, which, by my own argument , meets one of the three criteria to determine whether technology is an improvement over the old ways of doing things. But the efficiency itself is neutral ← it accelerate the distribution of good and bad in an equally fashion, with the equal power, and by nature will make no distinction whatsoever, and even if it can do such thing, we don't want it to, either — because the fundamental question isn't whether it can or can not, but by what measure it makes such judgement!? Isn't this nature of assisting both the good and bad causing the confusion what we are experiencing in the social medias? Yes, but only part of it. Here is another issue. If you have used ebay and has followed its growth, you would see the pattern that small players get crowded out of this space gradually and surely because they simply do not have the same level of resources to play against big players. On the Internet, if its business is a channel to propogate bits, its authors would eventually follow this pattern to concentrate onto a few (and they are still measured in millions at least) power houses — it's a shout game, and whoever owns the largest microphone and the biggest antenna, win. Receivers will be drowned in this game by the flood of information his/her brain needs to process before that subjective measure can make a choice ← if we take the brain capacity as finite ( capacity/daily = number of bits processed by secons * waking hours * 3600 ), then the producer can surely saturate this capacity, thus making it useless, meaning it will either stop to function totally, or seeing the error rate shoot up. We are already witness this phenomenon in the Facebook debate. I believe this is also how propaganda works in general. Like a Truman's world, how can you tell it's constructed when your info inputs are all constructed !? and to this extent, does it matter whether you live in a matrix ? This ia very pessimistic view. This pattern isn't new, and is being played out again and again and again. I start to wonder whether there is a name for such pattern, and what its solution is in a social context? If looking up how people discussed the effect of, newspaper, or the radio, and the TV, I'm sure I'll find these exact same arguments, just swapping out the words to Internet, viola, don't they sound familiar!? So I take those as an example, it does give us a peace of mind — that the human society didn't collapse, war was not caused by having radio or TV, marriage didn't become happier or unhappier, life in general did become more diverse and dimensional, more entertaining, and these stimulation translated to more creative mind (in both good and bad), which, I still believe, is the ultimate good thing → so far, the only thing limitless is the outcome of human mind. What if it comes up something, good!? Peace.","tags":"thoughts","url":"https://fengxia41103.github.io/myblog/internet.html"},{"title":"Nagasaki","text":"Your browser does not support the video tag. /* instead of the last line you could also add the flash player*/ What a fine early Autumn day, nice weather, nice temperature, nice breeze. Noah's first day to the middle school. His bus left at 7:36, so the day all started early, which feels, great, that I have done the gym and have checked my emails, and now can write down some thoughts before noon. Like it, except for the mosquito who just bited me, but unfortunately it landed on the seat next to mine, and SQUASH, it's now, dead ← does monk kill mosquitoes? I mean, do they consider them a form of life also, so that by their religious code that they shouldn't harm them either? or, they classify mosquitoes as a different kind, like 妖魔鬼怪 in 西游记, that can be killed at will? Talking about 西游记， this is what brought me to write this article ← Noah and I were riding back from Reader's Corner (btw, I picked up a book, Russel's why I am not a Christian , flipped through a few pages while waiting for our take out yesterday, very interesting!), I think we were discussing what to eat, and he said he was not hungry. \"But you didn't eat much for lunch either.\" I said. \"So? I'm not hungry.\" He replied. \"你这是要成仙啊!\" I commented. \"What is 仙？\" He asked \"They don't need food, they can just live, like 孙悟空。\" I tried to relate this concept to something he knows. Then all of sudden, it got me thinking — 孙悟空 is a rock, then why does he still eat, say 蟠桃!? and even more importantly, where do these food go!!!!? I mean, does he have a digestion system? and what about the, waste!!? Toilet won't help, right!? does he even have those parts, and the hole? Never thought of this. We know he had a feast on 蟠桃大会， but it was never discussed whether he processed these foods in the same/similar way as we do (which I believe majority of the audiences all think so!), and whether there are anything left at the end of this process, and how he got them out of his body !? Fascinating, isn't it!? I have argued in another article about how devils are truly in details, that the romance of the three kingdom never explained/described how their massive armies were arranging to handle human waste. Then here it is again, the all powerful monkey king was always eager for those magical goodies, 蟠桃，仙丹，人参果, but never had the need to either pee or poop! → I guess you can argue that he is super human, thus handle these foods differently, or that these foods converts 100% into energy of some sort, thus will not generate waste... but then, the 2nd one is shaky, because in the novel this guy ate all sort of things, especially when he was still only a mafia boss in his own territory → so he was eating all kinds of ordinary food. And even, let's say, he has upgraded his status to have now access to these magical foods, it's up him to judge whether this food is 100% energy, or only 80% — I'm now thinking how 猪猪 smells my food sometimes and will not even touch it, and I was always wondering how he knew this meat/milk is fine, but the other isn't. So I suspect the same challenge is faced by Mr.孙， how does he know!? Well, I know novels are fictional, and just any novel has ignored this part of human life completely, thus it's just a convention I guess. But a lot of time when I was reading novels, I found the author trying very hard to describe details with an intention to bring viewers into the scene as if it were soooooo real! Yet they all choose not to address this one single super important part of living — there are plenty description of feast, of hunger, of struggle for food, of survival on scraps, but characters, especially the super heroes, simply do not go to bathroom! But then, reading the book Nagasaki , the reality flies right into your face — messy, ugly, painful, full of choices that ended w/ terrible outcome, decisions that were bad or even fatal, good intentions went nowhere, begging for help received no response... I, like many many others, have been left with impression that the two nuclear bombs ever dropped on real human — Nagasaki and Hiroshima, ended the war and saved lives (usually we deem them to be American lives). Then we feel relieved and literally, moved on — moved on with our thoughts, with our discussions, with our interests. I have never given it much thought to realize that even when the war was over, the life did not. For all the survivors of the war, of course the survivors of Nagasaki, the war was over six days later, but life didn't. When we were all cheering to draw a period on history and ready to flip the page, the misery of these people have just started. Reading a book like this is, real, because when the details are being considered, described, you see the struggle of everyday life. The same sentiments are played when you lose someone dear, like Lei to me, that the deceased didn't really just disappear, they left a lot for the livings to absorb, sometimes good, heart warming, sometimes, sad, difficult to swallow. The life is truly like a never ending stream — it goes on and on and on with or without you, or the one you loved. But then, a moment like such trauma came, making a splash, or changing the course completely, often in an instance, but you have to endure its consequence for a long long long long time. Indeed, it's easy to mark an end of, an era, a war, but how to mark the end of, a life? Death? That's not enough, either. This makes me now think of the cartoon Coco — a life ends when, no one remembers you anymore... and if I still remember, still has the memory, can I give more life, to you!? I wish it will.","tags":"thoughts","url":"https://fengxia41103.github.io/myblog/nagasaki.html"},{"title":"Boston and other thoughts","text":"Trip to Boston was nice, especially when I saw old friends — uncle Tam, Eddy, Bob, Doc Shen and his parents. Not that it brought back many memories, but to see that people who have been in my life, of whom I wish to have a good life, are doing well. I think somewhere I have said it, that it matters more to me that the people I care about are living well, than myself does the same. I don't know. I have many thoughts this morning, but they come and go, and hard to put them down. I have been thinking a lot of the last ten years, the years since Noah came to my life. What a change! It's easy to say that change was taken because of him. Of course he was a major force behind these changes. But I can't help feeling there were more — some you can call destiny, some I can't describe what it is, like a million turns I took, or anybody took, in this course called life, that a step in this direction will lead you down to a path that, when looking back in this time span, say, 10 years, will seem so dramatic and different.

On the way walking over, an idea popped to my mind — am I a peculiar person? I mean, why am I thinking things in such a way that is so different from, others? Watching people walking by at work, they get excited by, say, the new garage, new seating space.... then, they are all good at keeping a meeting schedule, can attend those meetings even in some odd hours, or grasping an idea of a new project quickly. How? I mean, honestly, I just can't handle that kind of things. In a small group, among close friends, left in a corner even in a crowded market, I could perform well, think well, write well. But, anything that requires a fixed schedule of routine, I seem to have serious trouble to cope with... well, this is not true, either. I was running the meetings w/ SH team just fine, and it was not only productive, but I could say they were the best meetings I have been in since being here ← most others are just routine bearing a name so called \"scrum\", but we were only following the format rather than being practical and, useful. Well. Where should I go next? what should I do? Had a lot of dreams the last two nights — cambodia, singapore... I dreamed a life somewhere else, anywhere, but here. I know I want to get away, but to where? Anywhere without you will be the same to me, equally dull, equally colorless, equally, unhappy. I miss you. You are nowhere to be found, but I still search for you, in dream, in mind, in the darkness of this life. If there is such a surgery, like a heart surgery to cut off those cancer tumors, that just go in and cut off the piece that saves you and these memories, will that end all these, feelings? I feel I'm just groping through day by day, aimless, like a robot, picking him up, sending him off, watching the time go by, watching the cloud go by, watching the people go by, watching myself, whatever is left of me, go by. How funny! There are two people sitting behind me, and one is introducing the Lenovo Open Cloud, haha. This is truly something I can speak of, and should feel proud of. Maybe that's the peak of my profession career, by publishing two reference architectures as first author (well, if not to say, the only author cause I wrote 99% of the entire content). I don't know. I just feel there is something else I can do, something else I want to do. What is it? Maybe I should become religious, so I can say God pls tell me, and he will show up in the sky with him booming voice, and gives me some directions, like \"go there\", \"turn left\".. if only, there were such a being, and such a voice, and such a play... but if that ever happend, I know that will not help me at all, but I will look at him/her, and say, \"what the fxxk is this? and who the fxxk are u?\".... I'm just, hopelessly, angry, and having zero belief in another being, now.","tags":"thoughts","url":"https://fengxia41103.github.io/myblog/boston%20and%20other%20thoughts.html"},{"title":"Ulaanbaatar","text":"Who said it first, that the difference between human and other animals is that human can make belief , that we can imagine things, a scenario, a life, that does not exist. Therefore we invented arts, movies, music, literature ← all the existence that human can be proud of, and the only things that human bring to this world which are not put there by nature or God, are these imaginary things, make belief. I start to seriously wonder whether this speaks the fundamental truth of being, of what I feel, what I puzzle about, and what I sense. Walking back from gym, bright sunny day. Listening to this song, [Night in Ulaanbaatar][1], I couldn't tell anymore I was walking in light, or in darkness — the lights were blinding, barely any breeze, but comfortable dry air and comfortable temperature. Yet, my mind can only feel the wind, a breeze over the night of this remote city, which I have never been, and may will never be, 袅袅炊烟, sparsed lights here and there, a city that may only resemble the days in the 80s of China, and this song, lingering over the sky, like a radio wave, only the ones whose heart is receptive to it, hear. Without you I would never have heard of this song, nor would ever be sitting here writing down these thoughts as if someday you would still be able to read this, and know my days and my mind. How scared I am when thinking that we will forever be apart, being ignorant to each other's life, happy or sad. I know by the end of life it doesn't really matter at all. I don't even know whether I will have any sense of feeling left when I get to 80s — will I be numb to emotion? will I still, regret? will I still, tear? will I still, get sad? I wish I do. Really. With them, I can still feel, feel life; without them, I would hate myself. So here it is, a song that zoomed me right back to the days, when you first told me about it, night or day, it is only meaningful, beautiful, because of you.","tags":"thoughts","url":"https://fengxia41103.github.io/myblog/ulaanbaatar.html"},{"title":"People","text":"What is people? I thought I had it figured out, but now I start to wonder whether I'm witnessing another make-belief episode in the human history when an abstract word such as this being used, abused, taken for granted, without explanation, as if everybody recognizes its meaning, knowing its intention, understanding its logic, and accepting its implication. This, is troublesome, and sometimes I feel the word \"troublesome\" is too light a word to describe the evil such usage is releasing — it's like a poison released in those Nazi gas chamber, odorless, even painless. Yet, however long it takes, however unintrusive it is, it kills. So, what is people? When I thought I figured it out, I thought the key problem of this word is that citizen is a given right come with your birth — you are a citizen of such country, when you were born here, or sworn in, and thus being regulated by and abiding the country's law &mdah it's both an identity as you own a passport when travel which says who you are, as well the judicial obligation you are to be measured against &mdah if you were a US citizen, you first line of obligation is observe US law, thus defined as being a good citizen. People, however, is not a birth right ← you don't become a member of this group by coming to life. Instead, there is a judge somewhere in the hierarchy who qualifies you as part of the people, or not. And who will be this judge!? Well, not God, but some human, who uses some ideology as the yardstick to measure you. Therefore, every context under the name of the people , does not automatically apply to you, whether good or bad, because it solely depends your status at the moment ← if you are a member of the people then, you get the cake (and obligations, too); if you are not (stated by this judge whom you hardly even know), well, all bets are off ← you have been outcasted from a society , and the most disturbing thing human has invented form themselves is the saying that 非我族类，其心必异 — if you are not one of us, you must be one of them (them===enemy in 99999999.999999999% of the case)! This, is utterly insane! But everywhere you turn, you see the same pattern being played out by all kinds of people. Even for yourself, however honest and decent you are, or you think you are, you find this same pattern repeated in your everyday word, everyday act, and everyday decision: Why do we all like friends!? Isn't a friend someone who shares the same point of view, or having similar interest, or however s/he makes you feel relaxed, secure? Like interest group we belong, which is being manifested by social media — that I like reading, thus joining a reading club/channel, I like history, thus subscribing a history talk, and so on and so forth.... Aren't they then, 我族类? I always joke about women's zeal on bags, because if you pull 100 men off the street, randomly, pick any country, any city, any age, any other criteria, as long as they are man, I bet 99 out 100 will not know what is that difference which make the women yearn for between this bag versus the other! ← same as for women looking at men being addictted his gears, cars, computers, gadgets, games — what's so fun about them? Does this car really run that much better than the other one, because you replaced something called a muffler!?..... See, everyone of us, is, and I believe, have to, categorize ourselves in one group or another ! It's the only way we can ever function and go by our daily life, even though if you look from outside, or even from the opposite point of view, you find it utterly ridiculous, illogical, unexplainable, probably just insanity!.. but, why so!? and what's the alternative!? So words like the \"people\", by being such an abstract term, can be shaped into however way you want. But the underline ingredient is not changing — we human somehow want to form a group based on shared commonalities. Like a star being pulled by some gravity towards a larger star, that gravity has always existed, we are just slapping different tags on it, and in the end fooling ourselves that we have escaped such pull, and can run free. I used think government who likes to use the word \"people\" is purely manipulating the human mind by feeding the mass a \"group\" which they all think they belong to while downplaying the actual existence of such a judge who determines your membership. But in today's congressional hearing of Robert Mueller, every single senate on the committee used American People in his/her statement as if this makes the sentence indisputably correct and legit — but then, I asked myself, who is the American people? who is that hidden boss determining whether I'm one, or not!? If they want to refer to all the human living and breathing under this flag, why don't they say, American citizen!? Wouldn't it be clearer, and even stronger in legal sense, that these people were voted to congress by citizens, thus are responsible for citizens!? So much I want to shout, that stop using the term \"people\"!! You don't represent American people, there isn't even American people!! But there are American citizens, who have the legal right, and all these congressmen are employed by citizens. People.. hmmm...what if one day that boss decides I'm not a people anymore? on what ground? I mean, God is not determine people's membership, isn't he!? Then, who? This is a slippery slope, and everybody is volunteering to slide down with cheers. This, is indeed a dark age, IMHO.","tags":"thoughts","url":"https://fengxia41103.github.io/myblog/people.html"},{"title":"I don't think so","text":"It's a common scene comparing ancient time vs. today, and the common context of such comparison is that people in today's world, enabled by information revolution and its technologies, is overwhelmed by these bits in term of sensibility, thus deriving a conclusion that either we are becoming less and less sensitive, or that we are smarter than before. The former, however, I disagree. It's easy to picture someone sitting in front of a TV these days and his sense is being saturated by violence, vulgarity, and sex, the three element that, according to this book , are the forever winner if you want to sell in a commercialist world. However, I have long been thinking that the so called ancient time has been romantized in the same way that we view history in our lens — what we deem as evil and barbarian back then was not really so if you entered a time machine and truly lived in it; same applied to glories and achievements, and I'm sure same is true for everything between. What jumped to my mind is the book 水浒, the Song dynasty that so many elites these days are yearning to go back \"if given me the choice\". Yet, I think everyone will then agree that if measured by today's standard of comfort, life back then was quite harsh, if not being outwright brutal — you not only will witness beggars on the street, poor people who were by the brink of starvation, everywhere, but pretty commonly there would be some dead body on the street or a fight broke out ended up with someone dead! Well, then I'm talking about a whole pile of mess that is associated with any death — blood, body parts (think of the poor squirrels or turtles I have been seeing all through this summer on the road run over by traffic!), disformed body, and odor! We, today's audience, are used to seeing death in such an abstract form projected by a LED screen that only the sense of eye and ear are involved — if even going by the math, that is only 40% of the five senses we have equipped to collect signals for brain. That number, if put into any other context, would have already become suspicious if one claims a 40% represents the whole truth! Further, today's civilization has shielded most of us so far from such brutality of life, especially thanks for the advance of industrialization and ideology, that very few of us are given the chance to experience these scenes that ancient people were living with as a routine. How many times the book has mentioned someone being executed in public by chopping his head off? and this isn't distant memory at all for the entire world counting both the East and the West! Well, if you want to talk about how traumatizing an experience a person can sustain, watching someone being killed, even as a bystander, is ranked high on the list for sure! Coming from my own experience also. I recall when I was little, there were quite a few knocks on the door when someone was going door to door begging for food, quoted that they were refugees from some inland states escaping from famine and hunger. No kidding. So in my generation, in my own time, the memory of such existed, happened, and it was very much stronger to one's brain and conscience than watching a horror movie on your couch! Then, there is always the BS praise of yesterday's wonders, especially those wonder of construction in some massive scale that is hardly imaginable in today's life with today's equipments. They are wonders. But few, if any, of these praisers will want to live in that time and became part of the construction force so to become a participant, or even creator, of such wonders! It's utterly disgusting then that China's elites are trumpeting the achievements of the past as an evidence of the long life of the Chinese civilization, and sometimes even singing the praise of the emperor/authority as the genius/hero of the race, yet they hide themselves in today's civilization knowing there is zero risk of going back in time, if they love it so much!

Feng's view of how these confusing Javascript words are linked together spec The mother of all is the ECMAScript , which is the spec. It has some wild release notion and cycles. The important one for me is the ES2015 , and I think starting from that release, the schedule becomes annual, thus we have ECMAScript 2016 and so on. Since the 2015 release is the 6th revision of the spec, thus also created the notion ES6 ( ES2015 == ES6 ). spec implementation Javascript, together with JScript , ActionScript , are implementation of this spec, and of course, by different companies. The problem is, each implements some subset of the spec, thus there are overlaps as well as incompatibilities. Sucks! Therefore, when reading some Javascript articles, there is always reference to ES6 compatible or a feature, which means whether the Javascript implementation is up to that spec's release, or not. javascript engine and compatibility Ok. Here comes the giant twist — starting when the spec committee decides that before I put feature into writing, there needs to at least two implementations → browser's Javacript engines (and dont' get confused w/ browser engine , which itself is includes an Javascript engine, but do other things such as rendering HTML), that can make this feature work. So some engine implements a feature that will be added into ES6, for example, while others then have to play the catch up game once the spec is out, and even when a feature is usable in a browser, it doesn't necessarily in the spec yet → isn't this logic circular!? Anway. So this leads the browser's compatibility hell , check it out. superset & transpiler Then, nobody likes coding in plain Javascript (why!?), so there comes the supersets — CoffeeScript , TypeScript ... and then, Angular decides to use typescript to write itself. How wonderful! The reason they call themselves superset is that any plain Javascript is legitimate superset codes, but not the other way around — it's like you can write assembly in C code, but can't add a C function in assembly. Oh well, so enters the compilers (and the Javascript world must give it a new name, transpiler , hell) — they covert these superset code into, plain javascripts.. .well, you can translate many programming languages into many others (see the list ). So it's really in your development pipeline to use some tooling to make this compilation so at the end of the day, you are getting javascript . But wait, there is more. Not only they translate superset into javascript, it can downgrade your code from ES15 to some really basics. An example in this article which I'm showing below: \"use strict\" ; class Planet { constructor ( mass , moons ) { this . mass = mass ; this . moons = moons || 0 ; } reportMoons () { console . log ( `I have ${ this . moons } moons.` ) } } // Yeah, Jupiter really does have (at least) 67 moons. const jupiter = new Planet ( 'Pretty Big' , 67 ); jupiter . reportMoons (); will be translated to: // Everything below is Babel's output. 'use strict' ; var _createClass = function () { function defineProperties ( target , props ) { for ( var i = 0 ; i < props . length ; i ++ ) { var descriptor = props [ i ]; descriptor . enumerable = descriptor . enumerable || false ; descriptor . configurable = true ; if ( \"value\" in descriptor ) descriptor . writable = true ; Object . defineProperty ( target , descriptor . key , descriptor ); } } return function ( Constructor , protoProps , staticProps ) { if ( protoProps ) defineProperties ( Constructor . prototype , protoProps ); if ( staticProps ) defineProperties ( Constructor , staticProps ); return Constructor ; }; }(); function _classCallCheck ( instance , Constructor ) { if ( ! ( instance instanceof Constructor )) { throw new TypeError ( \"Cannot call a class as a function\" ); } } var Planet = function () { function Planet ( mass , moons ) { _classCallCheck ( this , Planet ); this . mass = mass ; this . moons = moons || 0 ; } _createClass ( Planet , [{ key : 'reportMoons' , value : function reportMoons () { console . log ( 'I have ' + this . moons + ' moons.' ); } }]); return Planet ; }(); You'll notice that there are no ES2015 features. const variables get converted to carefully scoped var declarations; class is converted to an old-school function constructor; and the template string desugars to simple string concatenation. Therefore, transpiler is also a way to map these advanced features into more vanilla form so it will improve compatibility (and reliability?). The one name I have seen over and over is the Babel , and there is even an live babel . module loader Coding is complex, and you need to break them up into modules , but then, who is going to piece them together!? That's the module loader. Two dominant ones — CommonJS , and Asynchronous Module Definition (AMD). This article explains it very well. So, these two are again, just methodologies, philosophies. An implementation of commonJS is Node.js , and for AMD you get require.js . I bet by now you start to see how these names fall into its own place and start to make sense, hopefully.

This occurred to me when I was browsing Slashdot at lunch, and started to realize that as a pattern which applies to everybody, you will only click into the comment for the titles you find interesting — this sounds very much legit and correct. But, wouldn't it enforce your interest in a certain topic because, like Noah's swimming practice, the more you practice, the better you become. Thus, the more you read about a certain topic, which started with a vague interest perhaps, the more you know about the content and topic and context, the more then you find the consequent reports and similar topics easy to understand, and more likely to provoke an emotion, which makes you feel the topic is dearer to you than others. Another proof of this is that when I was reading the title Researchers Identify the Origins of Metabolism , 53 comments, Hubble Captures Cosmic Fireworks In Ultraviolet (phys.org) , 35 comments, hina Is Forcing Tourists To Install Text-Stealing Malware at its Border , 216 comments — this echos how I feel when I'm using Youtube these days, and Amazon Prime → the recommended list are becoming more and more, homogeneous, and I can't help feeling that my horizon of information is becoming narrower and narrower. This, is indeed, disturbing! Not only that there is now external forces, like these suggestion algorithms, but I wonder whether our own brain is calling for this same food, thus finding comfortable when being presented with such an ever-shrinking diversity? A common perception of the old is that they are not open-minded , that they are often at odds with the popular trend and new things. Now I wonder whether this is just the true nature of our brain — after years of practice following this, instinct (for lack of a better word), one will certainly become very good at it, not mention if it is already a built-in component, like a strong pull, in this direction, to begin with! So the old are married with their rather fixed set of interests, just like all of us are, and have lost energy to consume diverse information because reading and listenning to unfamiliar information is very taxing on your brain, and perhaps your heart also. So really, the problem is that a person is getting weaker and weaker with aging, thus the brain is constantly selecting the least-resistant path, which then translates to this tendency, and manifested as a self-selected \"bias\" ← I quoted the word bias because, after all, what is a bias, if everyone is entitled to have his/her own opinion, and there isn't such a thing as commonly agreed right or wrong!? Doesn't it make that my words is just as equally sound or evil as yours.... Now I see why we need God, if only there is such a super being who can be the judge, who can call out a right or wrong, who one can turns to, as if we turn to a judge or policeman in life → it does feel good. Interesting. The so called curiosity, is indeed a fire in one's mind. It gets weaker and weaker, for whatever reason. Someone's had died down long time ago; others become smaller flame, and still burn, for a while. I wonder how big is my fire inside!? and when it is out, what becomes of me? A walking dead? or just everyone else — those bigfoots, when I viewed myself as the smallfoot, a human?","tags":"thoughts","url":"https://fengxia41103.github.io/myblog/self-selected%20bias.html"},{"title":"JSP to Angular","text":"application.

Before anything, I think this person is a thinker. It's actually very good, and I think he is very smart and observant, and he certainly is not following some made recipe → he is formulating a logic of his own, which he intentionally (and I think he is very much like me) to be different from others'. I usually will very much enjoy someone like this. But, but, his view point, well, is putting me off, completely. Geo type Number one, he has a completely wrong view by making a statement that US is behaving irresponsibly because it has the gene of a pirate ← because this country is next to oceans, and its counterpart is those countries on land such as France and Germany. This, is ridiculous! First of all, US territory is HUGE! It's comparable in size with any of these so called land countries — China, Russia... In particular, it's so much greater, I mean, in square miles, than France, Germany, that if the statement can qualify those two countries as so called having the land gene , the US will have to bear the same category → US is as much as land mass as any of the countries he is referring to in his talk. It's not the gene of the land that drives the policy and decisions, it's the need to expand (eg. Japan) or to defend your neighbour's expansion (anyone who has been invaded) that has always been the driving factor! Yes your geo will make this task easy or difficult, but the location is much of a God send -- well, you don't decide where your country lands on earth (in a high-level sense, that's why countries fight, so to find a better piece of grass!), just like not much you can decide who your parents are. Think about another case here, Poland, the poor country has been poorly defended because it is caught in between the Germany and the Russian. But why the two countries want to take over Poland instead of leaving it as a buffer zone between the two giants!? Wouldn't it be better to fight in someone else' home instead of your own!?... So my point is, expansion has a much deeper motivation than just a shallow view of continental type vs. oceanary type . In Poland's case, the racial/tribal factor and the religious factor have been the real reason why Russia want to take that land, and even there has been the historical bully vs. bullied sentiments (that Poland land owner was really harsh on Russians back then) that played a lot more important role in the experience of this country than anything else. you are born bad Further, such view point is the same as saying that you are bad guy because you were born in the wrong family ← doesn't this sound familiar, to any Chinese who are above age 30!? This is entirely ridiculous as far as anyone can reason! I think it's reasonable to have a view that all states are born evil, or all capitalists are bad blood.. that's totally fine, which also makes the whatever derived conclusion shaky if such view point is weak ← and to me, and I hope to many many others, this view point is not only weak, but is entirely, wrong ! History has proven this over and over, and as a Physicist, as he claims himself to be, this is the same as saying that Earth is the center of the universe, not because we can prove it to be, but because all my previous generations say so! ... No! No! No!... you are all welcomed to make such assumption/statement, but it doesn't fulfills itself. You need proof, and I mean, sufficient proof, to back up this statement, and often enough, even in Physics, it is the cross-checks that will prove or disprove a statement. If we cross-check US, say, its historical performance/treatment of other countries or ppl or whatever, wouldn't you then draw the opposite conclusion from what he just said, that US will be the evil, just like any other empires that had failed the human race!? If we do a cross check, I would say that China will not even see today's achievements without the US, or Japan, or Europe, or many many others that are outside China, non Chinese citizens → thinking of today's wonder as if China has single-handedly made them happen is just, completely wrong! So, does it make the US good? bad? .. you tell me. ignoring history completely It's really strange to use the, what I would call bogus math , to back up a statement — it took Turky the empire 1,900 years to achieve what China has achieved in 29 years.... and!? Can this then lead to the conclusion that China is sooo much better than Turky in history!? Of course not! This is the exact version of the story we have all known when we were little, that a guy eats donuts to fill hunger. When he gets to the 10th one, he feels satisfied, then his conclusion is that he could have skipped all the nine ones and just eat the last one to have the same effect!! This logic ignores the fact that what is being compared carries completely different weight when viewed 500 years ago vs. now — it is an everyday cliche to have wifi and iPhone, but back to 500 years ago these will be the sci-fi maniac talk! So using such a logic to illustrate how stupid the history was is just, bizarre! Imagine a high school student makes a statement that \"look, I know how the earth works in one class, and it took Greeks and Newton thousands of years to figure it out, how smart I am!!!!\" Wouldn't you find it, funny!? China's achievement is based on an accumulation of all the wisdoms and trial-and-errors that other countries have done, including some humanity disasters this world has seen, I'm thinking about Russia's social experiment... this is the same when any kid disregard the effort of the family, friends, parents, teachers, society have put in to make his success, and simply say \"look how hard I have worked, and therefore I deserve everything I have\" ... this is not only naive, this is purely irresponsible and selfish. Period. race to the bottom This is the worst of all logic. He keeps using examples of Great Britain and how it broke up w/ US, and US's civil war to justify how evil US will be we let them help us. Whenever he challenges the views of other economists who supports US's critism of China's unfair play, his logic always quotes \"look how bad you have been, so stop critizing me\" approach ← this is what I call the race to the bottom method, and it is terrible! This logic links back the basis of his argument that because you have done something evil in the past, you will always be evil. Even more disturbing is that he essentially spins the logic that China shouldn't play by rules because the bullies (the US and its allies) defined the rules — this can be extended to just any scenario in life, that the rapist is innocent because, well, why did you wear that type of revealing clothes!?.... come on, get a grip, really. There will always be rules, and someone get to define them. There is nothing wrong with this fact. You can disagree the rules and change them, but by just quoting the rules themselves are the root of evil is completly circular logic — again, this is the equivalent to say that you are a bad guy because, well, you were born by bad parents, and so you, and your children and children's children will be just as bad. self-contradicting, everywhere The entire logic is just self-contradicting! He claims is the theory that the rise and fall of an empire is like a body flushing through cycles. Sure, I take that. But then, if this is driving the conclusion that thus US is being flushed out and China is taking over, wouldn't China be in the exact same position as the US in, say, 10 years!? Then what!? Doesn't this theory then predict China will then start to fall!? But, this isn't the message he is going with, is this!? How convenient then that he just say, \"hey, look, I won't live that long, and you guys will witness this\"... he likes quoting Karl Max. Max's theory is truly comprehensive that it describes/predicts the entire cycle of a society, and essentially after Communism, there isn't none exist, it's the end of road, paradise. But his, by exactly establish the cycle as he is so proud of, predicts the inevitably fall of the rise of China, and he did not address a single line how China should act differently to break this cycle .. or, should I even call what it actually is, the curse !? Further, there is always an implication the world is split between China and the rest, or the US vs. the rest..... he quotes US as if US people are an unity, therefore whatever technology US has developed is only by the US people, which are different from, say, the Chinese! How ignorant this view is!! Especially as a Physicist, this is rather strange he perceives the world in such a way — isn't US an aggregation of, I don't know, hundreds of nationalities, races, backgrounds, and so on!? Isn't what the technology is, especially the cutting edge ones, the fruit of brains and collaborations in an international scale!? Even the ones he is so proud of — 北斗, or building jets, are nothing short of a phenomenon that the world is flat!? Again, by seeing everything on the foundation of a foreign origin (physics, mathematics, computer science), and drawing the conclusion that \"I'm the 牛屄est\", is just insane !!! US, China, any country, is a mix of a lot of different people and ideas. Assigning credits to a country is simply wrong — I would say, forget about describing these things along the line of a country or state or government. Rather, it's a matter of a stack of brilliant minds that moved the entire human race forward to what we have today, regardless the border lines. Thirdly, he opened his line by saying that the trade war is not a war of ideology, but then eventually derives to the discussion that China should ban anyone who \"helps US building infrastructure\" because it is a traison ← isn't this ideological!? Last but not the least, it's fine to feel proud of yourself, but it is not fine to look down your peers/competitors/losers, especially when the word used is 文明 (civilization) ! No, China is not the only civilization that still beats and kicks and feeling lively. All these long-life civilizations — Greek, Indian, or Slavonic, or Russian, or Native Indian, are just as wonderful and amazing as any, and they are not dead!! What an arrogant view when he thinks only China is carrying the human torch, like Noah, while everyone else is lying dead! Last words ..... Haven't written something like this for a while. I have to say, I admire his confidence, but disagrees completly his arguments. I won't have the same level of logical organization of materials and thoughts, but I know I will not get to his conclusions, none ← actually knowing this makes me, happier now.","tags":"thoughts","url":"https://fengxia41103.github.io/myblog/the%20wrong%20elite.html"},{"title":"Another Friday","text":"I don't know how to put today. Another Friday, sunny, humid, hot. This is the last day for many who were affected from last round of layoff. Ran into a couple people I know yesterday and this morning. Though I barely know any of them personally or through work. Nonetheless, they are familiar faces, and seeing something, someone, familiar to disappear from your life must be, and is, sad. I sat down with them to exchange emails, phone numbers, talked to them about the hirings our team is looking for, encouraging them to send me their resume and I will forward them, and can certainly provide more information regarding these positions and the project if they are interested in — I just wish there were something I could do, to make their life better? or to just soften the blow? am I again guessing their feelings based on mine, which, on the bright side, is called sympathy, on the flip side is called arrogant and even ignorant? I don't know. It's just part of me — I hate to see people around me sad, wish I could make things better, while, a lot of times, I feel I'm the saddest among them all, though I appear to be so upbeat and comfortable. m43 A lot things are going through my mind this morning, a lot of them. I don't know why. M43. Uploaded Noah's graduation pictures and videos finally. They looked totally fine when viewed on computer, but for whatever the reason they looked totally crappy on the camera's screen. Sometimes I even suspect that the camera's screen has such a high resolution, that it makes the pictures look very much pixelated, while in reality the photo is such a high resolution that they look perfectly smooth and, sharp , when being squeezed to laptop size, not to mention they will look simply gorgeous when printed on that tiny 4x6. I have been struggling to find the same level of pleasure shooting m43 comparing to the D70 or the D300 I recently purchased as 2nd hand from B&H. Somehow, I feel the Nikon pictures look so much, photo-like, than M43's. Maybe it's because my eyes have been so used to viewing these Nikon photos that even the M43's are better, technically speaking, my brain doesn't appreciate them as such. So that led to read and listen to M43 lens talks, discussions, and ebay listings, even the thought of a switching back to some autofocus lens made for M43 will bring back that photo look. Yet, these Noah pictures looked just fine, even with my Nikon eyes, they look, very nice — sharp, momentary, pretty. I think what I need is just a trust to my gear, to my decision, and to myself. human and contradictions Another thought. Human is full of, I mean, full of, contradictions. Taking any so called train of thoughts, I find the logic very shaky if to take a close examination of the reasonings. In particular, I am referring to the common wisdom that is used to support such reasonning — these wisdoms are used as if they themselves are the perpetual truth (because they are so aligned with your common sense). I was thinking, when, say, a manager of a team makes a decision → the Chinese team commonly justifies this that this is efficient → then, if we continue this reasoning, a common wisdom says there is no free lunch , which we all agree, right, thus if we do gain efficiency, what price are we paying → certainly, democracy, since not everyone is participating the decision. But, who says democracy is a good thing? Isn't this also a common wisdom? Because by positioning it as the price we pay , we are basing on the idea that democracy is, good. So here is one shaky spot. Let's continue → what about 少数服从多数？ Isn't this also a common wisdom? but we have also heard the tyranny of the majority , or even, 真理总是 掌握在少数人手里, and with my getting older, I do feel the majority of the mass are indeed, pretty clueless and ignorant. So between these two already contradicting wisdoms, I'm leaning towards the latter → but then, with such single decision maker pattern, wouldn't it be root of all troubles, say, we happen to have an unwise manager!? Even in technical term I'm constantly dealing with the single point of failure. Then, what's the remedy here? This reasoning goes on and on and on, and my point is, that these wisdoms themselves are already the flip side of each other, thus shouldn't be, and couldn't be, all true. Therefore, by plugging them into a train of thought to support a view or a conclusion is both convenient, satisfying, and misleading . I don't how to resolve this pattern, sometimes I even suspect the entire language and communication are built-in to have this pattern ← otherwise, communication will not even happen. So it's like an inherent defect in your gene. Nothing you can do about... well, just thought of another common wisdom right here — your strength is also your weakness → thus, this defect must also be the strength of human, I guess. late night show Listening to late night in the sun is an interesting experience. She has a good voice, really. I can't imagine her age can already speak of life in such a fashion. But I admire this, whether this is a staged show or out of her own mind. She has many good points, and she feels, real. Listening to these can't help me make me think of you. It has been a month now since I wrote you last time, the longest period I have ever had. Not that the emotion has faded and you don't come across my mind as often. No. You are there, still, all the time. I can't tell how many times you were in my sleep, when I was in gym, or playing guitar, or writing blogs, or cooking, or staring at Noah, or drinking coffee in the morning, or sitting in the sun wishing you were there, too... too many times, too constant, too real. The feeling of loss is terrible, and I choose not to look at it, as if it doesn't exist, as if it can be different, as if you are still nearby, close to, and missing me, too. But it's ok. I still think the reality of the outcome is better this way, even though the sentiments are crushing for me... I'm too old for you, and I will never never want to burden you to take care of me, when my body is failing, and even my mind might be failing... No! It's not to leave you with an image of health and all that... It's just practical. Aging is such an unpleasant journey as I'm seeing it right now, that I would rather go through it alone. Like a dark tunnel with a dead end, it comforts me to have a company, sure, but once I die and you need to turn back to find way out again, I'll be worried. So my love, this is better, go have a full life the way you wish and can. Just letting me to keep you on the mind is good enough for me. On my dying breath, I wish the thought of you will be the last thread leaving me. Let me think of the past, live in the past, and die, in the past, because that's where you were.","tags":"thoughts","url":"https://fengxia41103.github.io/myblog/another%20friday.html"},{"title":"Venezuela","text":"A country I only know by its name, Venezuela. Yet it's on the NPR news these days, and the country is going through some terrible times. The world feels, turbulent, really — US policy is aggressive that it's on war with China, with Iran, with just about everybody, and there are human disasters, as always, like in this poor Venezuela. The news mentioned the word, social fabric. This gets me thinking, more and more these days with a growing age, that the society feels like a living organ, a living thing, that, like an individual's body, changes all the time, aging, perhaps, but more accurately, adapting, constantly, so the word, the form that we know of today, will be so different 10 years down the road, that some of them even become the complete opposite! If individual human is already complex, then how can an aggregation of a lot of them, thus a society, becomes any less complex? It should only manifest the complexity with more combination possibilities, therefore more varieties, more alternative path of execution, and more outcomes/consequences. Maybe there is a probability one can compute to describe these outcomes. Yet, even so, it is probability, which inherently means that it is not deterministic, thus is not predictable (in the sense what we hope a prediction means). If rolling back a few years I think I would love to go into social study. I don't know whether they actually teach or analyze, or some smart person has already established a theory on this scale, that can help me to understand better what I see and hear in the news and in life. Nonetheless, this is a fascinating topic, actually I think it's a much more important topic than, say, am learning Angular for work. It is more important because it is closer to my life, or a bigger, more direct impact on people's life, than just me knowing yet another programming language and can write an app or two. Maybe this itself is a sign of my ignarance — that the grass is always greener on the other side. I remember this delivery kid in SH metro while I was sitting on the bench waiting for her. He looked at me working on the Project Euler problem on my laptop with a strong interest. since the laptop itself was not nothing fancy, I would assume his interest came from his curiosity, and maybe the look of the screen with a few line of codes and such which he perceived as computer programming, which to him is either a thing of strange, or a thing of mystery. In either case, for those who don't do computers certainly think programmers are nothing short of a magician (though, they think the trick is darn cheap that they can buy them one dime a dozen!). So the same applies to my view of the social study, and potentially some smart genius in that field that has the knowledge and tooling and experience to solve a social problem, which, to me as an outsider, is completely amazing, magic, and how wonderful! This makes me wonder, what if I stick to my own trade, using the tools I know, and the knowledge I have, wouldn't I achieve the same by moving the social needle, just a bit, that to the direction I think it's good for the people? Why not?... I'm not thinking of some social media page advocating my political view or revolutionary agenda, but something much smaller, something that is so remote to its effect that there isn't even a way to measure so that I can only operate in the dark without ever knowing how much the needle was moved. Wouldn't it still make my work purposeful? wouldn't it still motivate me? and even it still do in both questions, since I don't have a so called direction to guide me, how and what should I be working on then? In many ways I think we have romantized the good-old-days , that as if people back then were so in touch with his/her surroundings (by thinking that their physical and social territory was much much much confined than ours), that they could always link their actions to a cause and to a consequence. I would strong challenge this view. I still believe the core of this statement lies in information flow — if the scope was indeed smaller than we have now, the information flow was also much limited and vague. Thus, proportionally an individual, most of them, was also in the dark, and was only coasting by life, and probably wondering what the meaning of life is, like I do — the difference would be that they wrote with brush and ink, and I'm now typing in a computer (which, in 100 years?, will be in the same category as brush & ink, and that would not surprise me a bit!). So after all these derivations, there isn't answer, there isn't even a clue. If we think the Dark Age is a European thing in the past, I would have to say that, as of today, as of now, I feel, myself is still living in a Dark Age. So is this world, certainly so for the people in Venezuela, and for anyone who still suffers from seemingly the basic struggle of food, shelter, safety, being with loved one (not to mention all the broken hearts from regular loves!)... I don't know. Something is terribly wrong with this world, with the state of human, with myself. Just that I don't know what it is, why it is so, and what change is needed → such a sense of being powerless.","tags":"thoughts","url":"https://fengxia41103.github.io/myblog/venezuela.html"},{"title":"Dev structure","text":"If the Bible story happens today This is a common question any team/project will have to address — how to structure the knowledge we know of a project so that we are not missing things? Each project/application, of course, is different. But the overall is actually quite common. Here is a structure I'm proposing that is applicable not only during initial learning phase, but can guide the design and development as well. Take an example that we are building a portal, which has frontend and backend — the backend is showing more levels than the frontend , the idea is the same: Portal Frontend Design Build/packaging Dev breakdown ( incl. unit tests ) Tests Backend Design Logical view = > components = > key technology stack Components REST API web portal another.. another.. Build/packaging for dev for production = > CICD integration Dev breakdown ( incl. unit tests ) component A component B .... Tests all non-dev covered tests = > QA code static analysis ( LINT, style check, best practice ) scenario tests ( incl. \"integration\" tests ) machinary = > CICD integration The key is to compose a design/component view so that we can categorize work into component, which also speaks of key technology/implementation.

It's annoying if I need to go CVS paying $15 for a digital while myself owns a whole bunch of lenses and am proud of myself of taking good photos.. well, I guess this is exaggerated feeling, it's like saying that doctors shouldn't let other doctors treat them. Ok. So out of curiosity, I have always fallen back to GIMP to make a 4x6, thus 6 of 2x2, and print it for like 27 cents. So much satisfying! But since I don't do this for a living, it's totally new each time I need to do this. So, let's write this down once for all, so I can look it up next time, quickly. Steps is straightforward: Pick a photo with not-too-noisy background, because we will select using the intelligent scissor in GIMP. So the more contrast or clean the person is in this photo, the easier. Select scissor ( i ) and be patient. Close the loop by click left mouse on the very first point ← the mouse icon will change when you hover over that point. But honest, the point is so small that I can hardly follow it. Click anywhere inside the loop ← this is the step I keep forgetting. By doing so, the selection will blink with dash line, now we are in business. Paste selection into a new file. Now you should see only the selection, with like transparent background. Crop ( r ) to a roughly square shape → this is the step you can position your head in the way that passport photo wants — so much for the head room, show some shoulders: There is a tiny reading at the right bottom of the window when you resize the crop overlap, eg. 0.98:1 , so you are aiming for 1:1 to be square. Don't worry if it's not mathematically square, just approximation is fine. Some math ( reference ). Measure ( m ) from the top of your head/hair to the bottom of your chin → 1172 pixels, for example → resolution of the new photo = 1172/1.1875 = 987 (pixels/in) . Create a new image: size: 6 x 4 in Under Advanced , resolution to 987 (see step above) ← ignore the warning that you are creating some 200+M file. It's ok. Image → Configure grid , sec to 2x2 in, and view to show grid. Tried grid offset to 10px, can't see the difference. Select ALL of the cropped new photo (step #4), copy and paste, six times, in the grids. You see the result now. Grid line won't print. Use Filters > Render > Pattern > Grid to add an exact grid line overlay (will be printed as a light gray line, perfect!): width: 1 px spacing: 2 in offset: 10 px Save the .xcf file (as source), and export to a JPG. Now just find a place and print a 4x6.

China and all your patriotic supporters, don't take this view. It's annoying, and will not make you strong. This must be a super upsetting day for Noah, after a super good day for him and me yesterday, that he brought home his EOG report with a 4 for ELA and a 5(!) for Science!! Very cool very cool ~~~ Then, his beloved sunflower, the only survivor planted in the Spring, snapped near the root, and is already withering in front of our eyes. He tried to duck tape them back, but of course that won't work. I asked him pull the stem in the house so we can take a good look at it, and later give it a proper bury instead of letting it rot outside → so it won't be just another out of sight, out of mind, event for him. He shed some tears cause he really loved his sunflower. It was a fine plant, growing already about 5 feet tall now, and seems going strong. Looking closely at the wound, I think the stem had a bite mark when it was little, likely from the same offender who bited all the other sunflowers to death when they were young. So now growing tall and started to become top heavy, we noticed it was tilting this morning. Noah built a small support (duck taped together with two sticks) earlier. But when he tried to correct it even further, it snapped. This is an accident waiting to happen, not entirely really his fault at all. But he doesn't link these dots yet, and that's the pitfall of both why this is upsetting, and why I am using it as an opportunity to learn a lesson — accidents will happen. Some you can recover from, but there are others you can do nothing about. So it's better to be careful up front to avoid accidents. That's all one can do, and is all one should do, and when accident happens, all will be too late. Sorry Noah. I understand this is upsetting. I really do. I want to give you some console. But at the mean time, learning the reality of this is more important and valuable than having a shoulder to lean on so to pass it quickly ← I won't be there all the time. So don't count on a shoulder of others. Instead, become smarter, wiser, calmer, it will be much better that way for you, than hoping someone will fix it for you. Huawei's backup and weak logics Already wrote about Huawei . Had a few more lunch conversation w/ colleagues, all Chinese living here. The consensus is uniform, that Huawei is bluffing ← if their backups are so good, why haven't they been using them already? I feel this logic is actually interestingly, bad! Here is why. First of all, this is a sneaky way to argue. This same logic can be applied to any discussion to shoot down or diminish your opponent's point by saying that if you already had it, why didn't you show it or use it already? Well, there isn't a requirement that one must use it when it's available, right? Regardless how weak this question itself is (which I'll discuss more in the next section), still, there isn't such a hard line in the ground. Therefore, logically, I do mean logically, there is nothing wrong w/ Huawei deliberately not using what they already have, but to pay royalties to Qualcomm and others so to put itself in a vulnerable position as ppl now perceive. This is the same argument that there isn't anything wrong with one choosing not to marry, or married but not to have kids, or marrying the same sex, or even his/her pet!! ← it's the speaker's underline assumption that such requirement exists, though is rational, but itself doesn't define good/bad, right/wrong, and does not rule out these alternatives. Second, if this logic is so true and sufficient, this makes it impossible to develop and make new discovery then! Think about it. Before the discovery of North America, ppl (and probably majority of all ppl) did follow this exact logic, didn't they? that if there were another piece of land still undiscovered, we would have discovered by now already! and in science, this would be the same argument that if xyz exists (say, some quantum matter a theory spells out), we would have seen it already — well, we all know this logic doesn't stand, of course. It can't be. The loophole in the verb actually → this quantum matter does exist, just that the \"see\" is different from what we know! So was North America, just that we didn't know because the ships were not good enough to get there! So, replay this to Huawei's argument, dismissing their backups using this logic is at most, weak. They may very well have developed a secret weapon that is so powerful and awesome, and no one has yet seen it — it's the problem of my eye, not them bluffing. I want to point out these two aspects of weakness of this argument, because they are everywhere!! — we use them in arguing whether there is alien, whether a person is worth his salt (if he is so good, he must have fortune and fame by now!), and so on... the not B &rarr; not A = A &rarr; B , but to proving either side, itself must be sufficient. Otherwise, both sides are insufficient. China's opportunity and nationalism But now back to the consensus, logics might have been a weak one, the conclusion is correct. I do think Huawei is bluffing, and I think all the Chinese articles and talks I have been seeing and hearing are being irresponsible by not making this harsh conclusion that points right to Huawei's nose! Forget about the marketing scheme that this failure is also an opportunity — it's the same speaking to someone who just lost a job that now it's an opportunity for you to start a new career (or to pursue your dream). Fxxx you. It is only opportunity if this person has a dream in mind, has been waiting for such moment, has some practice of it already, and is willing to take this \"opportunity\". What would you call someone who just kicked a non-swimmer into the water and say, hey now it's your opportunity to learn swimming!!? Same here for China and its IT (let me use the broad jargon \"IT\" for ease of writing) ← I totally believe they are not ready. Period. Take a view from the end of user, the product itself represents a stack of many layers deep in term of technology. In Huawei's case, let me just focus on the software aspect of this stack. For it's chips, design is written in software (eg. verilog), compiled and simulated in software (according to a talk, all of them are developed by US companies). Move on to operating system, libraries/modules, opensource tools, applications, I believe they can develop applications (but even this is a problem, because one single company developing software for its own platform has been proven to fail in the context of mobile apps ← you just can't compete with world's talents, all the app developers who are outside your company, regardless how big and powerful you are!). But for all the techs on this stack, Huawei not only doesn't own them, it will have zero chance to re-invent them (as many of the supporters believe), let alone implementing the entire stack from scratch! No, way. Then, taking all these to the ground zero, I say the picture is simply bleak — all the advanced theories and practices are being rolled out in the US, and there is one thing I joked about before, but am darn serious about its implication — every single code you can see, is written in, English!!!! For those hotheads who are patriotic and nationalistic, this is one thing that kills your argument 100 to 0! — Language is for description, and description is driven by a way of thinking, a view of the world. Therefore, by writting code in English, dev must be adopting the non-Chinese view and logic, and the better a programmer you are, the more so you must be!! Since no company, let alone Huawei, can invent another programming language in Chinese, the so called opportunity so China is cut off from the rest of the world and 自己玩, is really, an impossibility. Regardless how it sounds hurting and is against their wills, not only I believe US and China are relying on each other and should be so going forward, by many many practical considerations, but I find it totally annoying and pretentious when these ppl trumpet national sentiments when the underline reality is that the new shinning opportunity are still implemented in your enemies' language (and actually by these enemies' theory and videos and books.....) Don't they feel ashamed then!? Well, I can see what their argument will be — see, we defeat our enemy using their own weapon. How ever more so satisfying!!... so really, when someone can look at a logic paradox in such a fashion, there isn't anything s/he can not believe, and will not advocate. After all, they pay the lip service, gain attention and maybe personal gains, and reality always fits in their model, magically, so they will never be wrong .

Yet, probably because of that, I'm even more sensitive and often eager to hear and to see different views, to hear different thoughts, and to engage a debate/discussion who so, and why not. To me, it's a checkpoint they provide to validate my thoughts and logics, and to help a mental rehearsal so I can see how well my conclusion stands to the test of challenge, and how really clear I can explain them, and maybe even to convince them, if my view really carries merits — it's always good that mine gets shot down by a deeper analysis and a deeper thinking, because that, like someone's awesome POC, shows me another possibility I have yet to come up with, and I think as long as someone has figured it out, I shall be able to, and take it even further, with my mind. The entire Huawei story in recent news are, in my view, nothing but a fiasco. The Chinese media again sound the drum of national interest and bully of the western powers, and this is nothing short of being a war, if only without exchanging bullets, but plenty greeting-to-your-mom flying across. I don't know what Huawei has as so called backups. A story says its OS is based on an opensource version of the Android, and these phone makers are not stranger to bundling Playstore together with their own off-shoot OS because they don't come w/ Google support natively. So this explains quite well how Huawei can survive this shock and boost national confidence once more, especially if it spins the story to be that \"I have seen this coming years ago, and I am so prepared that I can fight, and win, anytime.\" ← how well this fits the current national sentiments! But you see, this is the exact danger that I will argue to watch out for. I wish Huawei will fail the battle just like ZTE did, so it doesn't propel this smoking curtain of China's confidence in technology (well, technology is a big word, so let me limit myself to things I know — cloud using Openstack or container, quick prototyping using any programming language, networking design to separate management traffic from data traffic.. sounds pretty boring, right? But that's exactly my point, engineering, and technology, should be boring, because they are sooo detailed, and hard, that it's not fun to put them together at all, because 99.99999% of the time, they don't work as you want them to be!). China has seen waves of hypes that created unicorns, mass fans, elites who BS without even knowing a thing of technology, and a blind belief that \"yes we can, because we dream\". If you have ever tried to write a line of code, or to learn a topic (think of your school days), or a sports as hobby, you know that unless you have experienced pain, frustration, upset, disappointment of yourself (and many others), countless time wanting to give it up, nights and days of losing motivation and wondering whether you made the wrong choice, staring at a wall feeling completly clueless what this god-damn thing doesn't work (but it worked yesterday!!), then, honestly, you know nothing about engineering, nothing about technology, nothing about how all these seemingly so common things — chips, OS, any programming language, or library, or any stack that runs, at all, is put together. So really, wishing to win a battle is easy, wishing to defeat Google is easy, doing so is, hard, really really hard. If Huawei's agenda is still based on an open source Android, I bet it will not only fail, but doesn't solve the problem at all. Not only it won't work, to tink of it, isn't it even more humiliating that you are now using an unsupported version of thing, like a left over, or a cutting edge lab, that you are either becoming a guinea pig to be tried out with the latest experiment, or always a few commits/versions behind!? How is this going to be a good thing!? Further, I admire that Huawei has been preparing for this moment for a while, which, is a practical thinking. Miro always wants to replicate a open source so we control our own destiny , and I totally agree. Same for any knowledge, I always want to learn and understand even if the domain is not part of my job at all, because only after I have an overall understanding of these things could I now make changes to my design and code with well-thought-about confidence what it will impact — this, is the job of engineering, and should be, for all of us. I don't doubt Huawei will fulfill its statement of continuing to support its customers, because it said nothing about the level of support and the quality of their service ← the entire 1.4 billion customers have been living without Google, any of the western news channel or app, and are perfectly, happy. Thus, it's not surprising they will continue to be that way, without Google, without app store, without Android even. Nothing wrong about that. What is wrong, is that they are being shut not only from possibilities, but from knowing these possibilities! What is the important to make a customer happy!? Options! So their customer will not be happy, by this definition, because they will lose, options, not gaining more. Further, being kept from these technologies don't bring energy to create new, more awesome ones! That is a wishful thinking, but has never played out in history ← aren't there plenty example in this country's history, even very recent ones, that shutting doors will only make us weaker, not stronger! It's like raising kids &mdmash you can either keep him in a bubble in a bacteria free environment, or let him get sick young and even put the same virus called immunization into his vein, so that he can grow up healthy. Same principle applies to technology. The only code that is good, is the one that has been looked at by many many pairs of eyes, has been deployed to many many use cases, and likely have a long bug list — it's a good sign! The unicorns in China that dominates that market, but fooling the entire 1.4 billion users that they are perfect , is neither perfect, nor good, and stands no chance when there is competition, and I mean competition of technology, not $$. Yes I know, they have a lot of money. But looking at any of the failed giants, they all had deep pocket, a lot of money, a large team of talents, but they fail in a matter of months, because they failed in technology race. Huawei is fine, and can be fine. It will only start to fail, if itself is believing the lie it is feeding the public. And for the upcoming uproar of chips and operating systems, see my other one .","tags":"thoughts","url":"https://fengxia41103.github.io/myblog/cup%20of%20joe.html"},{"title":"女子图鉴","text":"Man, after watching the 東京女子図鑑 , then the beijing version , I can not stand the shanghai version at all!!! What is wrong with these story tellers!!? I mean, really, what is wrong with you!? Can you, honestly, give some thoughts of what the original Japanese one is about, and be a better story teller when translating it to your local version!? Not only the story line is summarized as an immature girl fresh out of college starts her humble but ambitious life, then going through fortune and fame, and a dozen men in between, and there is a marriage, a divorce, and back to her home town to sigh and reflect, which, to me, is almost like plagiarism, but the details are full of what I would call the stereotype of women, and that's just disgusting! On the 2nd episode of the SH version, let me start with this. humble college graduates, and women Why!? Why the fresh college green must be humble, be talked to, mentored at, looked upon, like something better than dirt!? Why!? All of them are behaving cautiously as if s/he is afraid to step over some invisible mine. Why, why, why!? Why put up that kind of voice as if yourself is the dust that is worth nothing? Then privately vows to become someone who is outstanding, extraordinary!? This is just bizarre!!! Absolutely strange. And why all these girls must be like that? talk in a low voice, with smile while her thoughts are cursing that person in front of her. There is no reason at all. The workplace is assumed a hierarchy at the very beginning, and this is not a modern display of a women's growth, but a familiar plot of emperor's concubines fighting for a single man and his sperms! This, is the very tragedy of Chinese biz culture I have been criticizing about in many other blogs. Work is a place to communicate thoughts, contribute your know-hows, not where you climb the social ladder just to be looked at as a peer and colleague — fxxk it, if any company treat u like that. Trust me, it is not a good company at all, and never deserves your time. Zero. So just walk away. So back to the Japanese version, the girl was eager to get into Tokyo, but was never lacking her own thoughts and preferences — she didn't know better how to do many things at the beginning, but she was not playing stupid. Actually, I would say the character is, should be, quite the contrary. Who is to have a high dream of going to Tokyo, or Beijing or SH — the ones who have self-confidence, feeling she can do much things, ready to be crushed, and must have been crushed in life in some fashion already, thus thinking she can survive the unknown, and will come out alright. Right!? The conservative type will unlikely even take the first step of leaving at all. So for them, the show will stop at, what, episode 1!!?? So this setup of them being bullied left and right at the beginning of their career is just illogical, and is the opposite of what she is. mini skirts And what's wrong with these women in office dressing mini skirts!? Even as a man who totally enjoys the scene and appreciate their long legs and fine skins, but really, this is becoming a fantasy show! Might as well set the plot in Mars! I know I know, this is not a reality show, not a reality check and you can argue that even the TV, the movie, by definition, is just another form of fantasy that give you mental high. I get it. But really, if they do care about their job, and I think they must do, otherwise, they can do other things besides coming to office everyday at all, and if they are as stylish as the plot is trying to make us believe, they simply should not be so careless at all! Mini skirt in office is like a big tag on the head that I'm going to sleep up the corporate ladder ← you can think and behave and try all you want, but who will broadcast her strategy while hopes to win? That's just plain stupid. the mentor Really, the first female mentor/idol must be some cold blood super stylish mature woman who is angry, picky, rich, and full of success symbols. Why, why, why? The experience they want to display can be shown in the quality of their idea, their document, their design or even PPT, but really, should be the last to be linked to their own dress, the handbag, and all that. You know why!? Because if she is sooo smart and wise and mature, she would have cared less about all these things, not that they don't wear them or buy them, but they know too well these are just symbols, and they don't need these to shout to other employees, especially lower ranks, by using them as her identity... that will be just, too, shallow, too 101, don't you think!? BS hr hr... what is wrong with these HR and their interviews!? No HR would ever dare to make statement in front of interviewee with a sneering tone!!!!! I don't care who they are and which company they represent, if they do that, the company should have fired them long time ago, because no company wants to be pictured an arrogant ass, certainly not worth it by only one HR employee! The only underline message I'm getting by this behavior is that: You interviewer's opinion and view of me and my company is meaningless. I don't care. Look how tough I am by trashing you in some way. Come one. This is just a display of power which is completely unnecessary, not to mention unprofessional, and actually quite, again, stupid. The reality is, yes, I don't care about your opinion, you can't harm my company, I can flunk you if I want.. but you know what, I'm not gonna tell you these at all, but keep them to myself, and maybe vented to my family or colleagues, but what's the point to display me as a nasty HR in front you, a 99.9999% stranger who I will overlap in life for, what, 1 hour!? I must be either insane, or just have a GIAAAAANT ego. men, men, men The center of a women's universe, is still, men... that's what I get from BJ and SH plots. Not thing they shouldn't have love and beakups and all that. But. You feel loneliness not only after your breakup. You feel fulfilled not only when you have a love. You want to find out who you are, what you want, why you like this but not that, why you love this but not that, long long before you meet anyone, and long long long after you two go separate ways. It's the self-reflection that builds you, the memory that kills you. The agony of not being able to forget that torment you day and night, and blocks you from ever feeling a strong emotion — anger, love, hate... but you want to know why, want to know why not me, want to know what I did wrong to get to where I am, what to know whether there is round 2, a reset, or a time machine. That's such a strong urge that, honestly, if you haven't had that, that is not love, and your man is just a mate, that fills your fantasy, your need for a time, but is bound to be thrown away, maybe mutually even. What it should have been The Japanese one is a good one. Not because it was the first one I watched, thus having the advantage of fresh mind, but because it describes a women's growth, mentally, not through her men, but through herself. I like 20,30,40 , also because the story describes so well the struggle that is unique, yet so common, to the women at that age — the energy at 20s, the confusion at 30s, and the flame and cool down at 40s. I still remember the last episode of the JP one , that she sits by the curb and met her highschool mentor who suggested her to lower her dream for some mediocre college... the old woman was happy to see her, and was happy for her success. She was wise, and the character started to see how wise this woman was, even back in the highschool days.. she wasn't shooting down her dreams, but was being what her age should be, and see what the feeling in the end will be — something lost, something gain. You never feel the gains compensates enough the losses. But it's 10 years passing by, you can not turn back the clock. So is life, for everyone. The 40 some Japanese woman watching those young girls dancing and shouting, \"courage!\", turned around and said, \"what do they know about courage? If I do that and shout courage, that means something.\" So true. 少年不识愁滋味，爱上层楼。爱上层楼，为赋新词强说愁。 而今识尽愁滋味， 欲说还休。欲说还休，却道天凉好个秋。","tags":"thoughts","url":"https://fengxia41103.github.io/myblog/tujian.html"},{"title":"Life like a turtle","text":"Walking back from gym a moment ago, passing the 奈何桥 I was always joking about with her back then. Nice, cool late Spring day, beautiful weather, beautiful sunshine, beautiful sky, almost beautiful day. Out of the glittering sun reflection off the pond, there was this lazy dark patch floating over there — a turtle, just enjoying its time, like I felt. I was watching it, and immediately the thought came to me, that probably like everyone else who, if had watched this scene, would have thought, that if only my life is like this guy, just taking time floating in this peaceful pond, enjoying the weather, enjoying the life, how nice would that be! Then, I realized that, with earphone plugged in, I was also listenning to Mozart's Minuet in D, that is now the tune that I have played many many times for Dad in 泰康 in his room, that I found peaceful, relaxing, and beautiful. But then, the turtle had no such tune — however he was enjoying his time, he has no Mozart. So really, the perfect life I was thinking, and probably true to many who felt that way relating this turtle, but without realizing, is that we want to be like the turtle, having a good time in this pond, not rushing, but also, having Mozart by our ears, or a big ass TV playing your favourate show, or some food to fit your appetite, or a lover to satisfy your emotion or your body, or a good job or title to meet your ego and monetary goal, or a car you picture yourself to race on the road or drive by your ex- whatever, or a clothes that makes you look like that exact picture in Vogue, or a handbag (which is a topic I have really little clue why it's good, how it is good, and honestly I couldn't tell the difference. Period.)... So really, we are all after, is a combination of a lot of things, a lot of conditions that need to be TRUE, at the same time, all be there, all be available, all be playing out, all be present, all be yours. This is not greed. This, is life, or be more precise, an image of life, that you put yourself in, imagining you being the character in that picture, in the center — the center of the scene, the center of the story line, the center of that comedy or tragedy, the center of all the attentions, the center of the playwright, the center of that composed, virtual, but also sooo real, universe. How interesting. I have always had the feeling that sometimes I felt this entire life thing, the desire I feel, the disappointments I had, the frustration, or happiness, are all nothing but a projection out of my mind. Not that they are thus changeable by just switching your mindset/prospective. Quite the contrary, they take a life sooo strong in their own that they overwhelmed me to the point that sometime I felt life was too hard to continue, and sometimes too beautiful to let go → thus, lost in between, start to wonder what is real, what is truly the meaning of all these, are these really, necessary, inevitable, or just a made up by myself, like a self-entertainment. But then, I were the director of all these, feelings, why can't I control it, make them, different, remove the parts I don't like, and leave the parts I do like? Wny can't I!? why can't we!? The turtle floated towards me slowly, as if it noticed my watching, but decided to went back into the water and disappeared. Maybe it has his tune of Mozart, maybe it doesn't really care about Mozart at all, like I don't care a bit of that fish he finds it hot, or that piece of mud hole he calls home. Maybe, he is not that enjoying the day at all, but like some colleagues smokeing in the smoke area, just taking a smoke break, or a coffee break, so the turtle is taking its whatever break !? Maybe. I don't know. I would not ever know. But one thing I do know, and I felt it, again, uncontrollable, like all the other emotions I wish to get rid of but can't, or the ones I wish to stay but sometimes hard to find again — I miss you, wish you were here, so I could tell you about my thoughts of this turtle, and you will nod, or ignore, or just play your phone, or just doing nothing. But no matter. You will be here, next to me, and that, is my dreamed life.","tags":"thoughts","url":"https://fengxia41103.github.io/myblog/life%20like%20a%20turtle.html"},{"title":"Reflection on technology","text":"Stanislav Petrov This , is an excellent topic, excellent!! I love it. We need reflection of technology, of the terms tech talks use to promote themselves and to dwarf others. I have argued before that the so called 弯道超车 is ridiculous and outright disgusting. Period. This implies to take a shortcut to win the race. I understand perfectly technology and new way of doing things can, and should be, if they are actually good, disruptive. But like everything else in life, the majority of all are just mediocre, and even trying-too-hard. The true good ones are always, I believe, always, organic — meaning that the idea comes from rich experience and deep insights, not some outsider dreams of a new way overnight. My favourate these days is the news of vpnhub owned by pornhub ← what a wonderful genius idea!!! Technology is good, is wonderful, and is hard. I have stated in what does IT system bring that there are three, and only three benefits a technology is going to, and should, produce — information transparency, efficiency, and accountability. The article made a very good point that: The word \"innovation\" has become synonymous with Silicon Valley to the point of absurdity. Indeed, the tech industry's entrepreneurs and \"thoughtfluencers\" throw it around as casually as a dodgeball in a middle-school P.E. class; what it really means is perpetually unclear and purposefully hazy. It is vague enough to be suitable in nearly any situation where a new product, service or \"thing\" is advertised as superior to the old — never mind if the so-called \"old\" thing has some distinct advantages, or if the new thing's superiority is solely that it makes more money than the old thing, or if there are other old things that are actually superior yet which won't make anyone rich. (Consider Apple removing the headphone jack from its new phones to be Exhibit A.) Like other buzz words, the word technology , innovation , are becoming a cliche, and are being used freely without clarification nor accountability. Technical solution, especially in the sense of everybody's life, is becoming the new middle man that take a share of the transaction, but downplaying any human element left. The thing is, baristas and cashiers aren't things that we are all dying to get rid of; this isn't a comparable situation to the horse-and-buggy days, where cars felt like a serious improvement on using beasts of burden for transit. Silicon Valley is only trying to put baristas and cashiers out of business because human labor costs money; the difference between a $4 coffee from a robot and a $4 coffee from a human is that there are no labor costs in the former purchase, something that makes Silicon Valley go googly-eyed with dollar signs. The tech industry's vision of the future is of a world with less human interaction, less conversation, less humanity; and more surveillance and more monetization of our buying habits. No one wants this, but it's being forced upon us. It is very concerning that everyone is hailing for Facebook's downturn, or even its success, because what I'm witnessing the impact on social interaction is darn disturbing — I can not, and refuse to budge, that two young couple sitting at a breakfast in Shanghai will each read their smartphone, but not talking, not holding hands, not making eye contact, and not being social! This, is ridiculous ! The only argument to defend this is always convenience. But then, convenience isn't the crown jewel of humanity, isn't the goal of life, isn't even necessarily a good thing. I like convenience, but it will never dictate my choice of life, because, after all, there is still, responsibility, duty, integrity. Do something truly smart, is good, admirable. But in too many occisions, I only saw pretended smartness, which, I have a word, pretentious .","tags":"thoughts","url":"https://fengxia41103.github.io/myblog/reflection%20on%20technology.html"},{"title":"Mars","text":"Your browser does not support the video tag. /* instead of the last line you could also add the flash player*/ Noah and I had a curious conversation. While pulling off the highway towards the Reader's Corner, I asked him to look over the powerball sign to see how much it is now — 250 millions. That's a lot of money. So I teased him again about my condo in Tokyo (or really, anywhere will be just fine), and said that if he owns the Japan Airline, as he is thinking, then he must be having more money than this powerball even. So we started to talk about moving to Mars, that once the Earth becomes too crowded, maybe he should get me a condo on Mars, or the \"other side of the Moon\", as he put it. But then, it suddenly occurred to me — when we talk about migration to Mars, there is always an implication that you must be super rich in order to be the first few that can enjoy such privilege. Isn't it so when we hear on the news that who and who reserved a seat going to Mars, and this person is always the super successful tycoon and we all think that \"of course! For him/her, that ticket is just a pocket change.\" Though to us, that's always a lot of money. However, here is a flaw in this logic. If we look at history, who went to those remote, distant place away from home? who went to the newly discovered the new world? Australia, criminals, unwanted; the America, religiously suppressed group; 新疆, Tibet, the West, even Canada, what pops to your mind is not a pleasure trip and glamorous life, but a super high risk, though mixed with excitements and possibilities, but certainly no one expects to find a pleasant, comfortable life that will beat what you get at home!! So if we listen to these historical examples, one must then relate that when Mars is finally settled by human, the first couple batches will be in a barren place and likely just die, out of thirst, starvation, or God knows what. What we are thinking of going to Mars as those riches are going, is basing on an assumption that once we can settle on it, the technology is so advanced that the land zone will be not only super comfy, but so much cooler than anything you will find on Earth ← what we are hoping is that the place is the summit of the entire human race, it is constructed with the best know-how the entire world can pull together, thus must be the ultimate to experience. Well, it's ultimate experience alright. But because we will be so new to the environment, to this new world, even the best of we get may be insufficient to deal with the challenges, or be the entire opposite strategy that will work, or somewhere in between. Never try, never know. But being onboard as pioneer is not what we associate with a rich's life style. More likely, it's like visiting Japan, or China, or India, by the missionaries by ships back in the 18th century — it's exotic, but is a pretty terrible assignment for those who went. So, if we won the powerball, I'll stick to my wish of a condo in Tokyo, or Cambodia, or Singapore. Mars, or the Moon, or anywhere there isn't much human yet, thank you, but no.","tags":"thoughts","url":"https://fengxia41103.github.io/myblog/mars.html"},{"title":"Globalization","text":"I have been thinking about the word \"globalization\" in the last couple days. I used to use it a lot during my MBA days as if it's a magic word that fits into any topic, any slides, and made it look instantly a good one, thus bringing me good score. It was iterated but without me ever giving it much thought of what it actually means. What does it mean? There have been numerous discussions on how China is concerned about national security when CPU and operating system are not home made, which I have elaborated in another article that such feeling is completly off the mark. But this does bring me another thought, that whether it is even possible, or advisable, for the world to strive for max efficiency? and if so, what does it mean? Globalization is always dressed to be an equal of international collaboration. Examples are always that how components of any product you can see and live with are now made in so many different countries here and there, and it is the supply chain, cheap ocean fare, and cheap labor of billion Chinese made them possible. Thus, the discussion leads to two threads, always: When dwindling Chinese cheap labor, who else is going to make them? With so many stuff crossing border to make them happen, zero tariff is a must. And the underline message is always, that globalization is to make each country do what they are good at, so that the world's efficiency is improved, thus benefitting everyone. Look at how the billion Chinese are lifted out of poverty! But, here is a spin. There are plenty arguments around how some countries refuse to open up their certain sectors and that's hindering development, for them, and for others, too. What if we all open our markets, at the same time? → it's a wonderful world, isn't it!? No. Actually, I would strongly argue here that, there is a fundamental problem of this idea, and about globalization in general, and its underline message in particular. If we go by this logic, then each country (or a group of people, or an individual) should go by doing what they are good at, but let others do what they are good at. Well. If American are good at army and fighting, shouldn't we abolish our defense entirely and let them do the job? You see, this is the same logic that mafia uses, or colonization does! and this will never work! Not that this is not a good formula, actually it is, from efficiency's point of view, but it will not work because of the way human are organized into so called country, and countries are different, just like individuals are, and yet, we have a preset condition that everyone is born equal, and every country \"deserves\" development and comfortable life and national security and ...... the laundry list goes quite long, as you can see. Therefore, if a place is good for tourist, we (anyone else besides that place itself) all wish that they do what they do — tourism, and let us handle everything else, such as making cars, drinks, foods, and sell to you! How wonderful! But there are many logic problems: I'm good at this A today. But should I be locked into A forever!? Doesn't developing tourism propelling me to be better at tourism, but have no chance to practice to find out my other talents!? Doesn't this actually this tourism a single point of failure, that I'm so dependent on it, that if one year it didn't play out, I'm dead!? If I'm using money to buy from you, doesn't it put me at risk that you can just take away all my profits by lifting prices, and I have no leverage? Isn't this how farming tenants were robbed by their landlords for centuries? There are something I can't just buy off the shelf, aren't there!? We already said about national defense. We can't outsource police either, nor government in general (yeah, US is very good at management, let them manage our government then), and food (doesn't importing food, or oil, already create so much friction that it is causing war and many other problems!?).... Essentially this logic will derive to the conclusion that a place should be locked into a certain status, like a person should be locked into a social ladder, forever and ever. This apparently will not play well with anyone, or with any country. Nobody wishes to be that way. So here comes the savior — a new term, a new label, a new word, but really, the same old colonization concept — one road one belt, open market, and globalization. It's a great idea for earth as a whole. But I don't think earthlings will ever embrace it in their existence before, well, earth is gone.","tags":"thoughts","url":"https://fengxia41103.github.io/myblog/globalization.html"},{"title":"Emotion","text":"I have been listening to this midnight talk show by this woman/girl for the last few weeks on and off, and found it quite fascinating, not that it's sentimental and discussing the eternal topic of love that is guaranteed to acquire attention and discussion and audience. I found it interesting because there are so many of this type of programs out there, and they all sound the same — same opening line, same background music, same speed of speech, and sometimes I even feel they have the same text(!) But what's the most fascinating thing is, this woman's opening line, \" 嘿，睡了吗?\"... first time hearing it, I felt a tiny bit strange, though it feels pretty typical for program like this, reminds me the 相伴到黎明, a program I liked in college days. But, it daunted on me what's so strange about this line while doing dinner last night. This seems to be a question of Yes or No. But, it can only have one answer! — if you are asleep, you won't hear it! thus, will not respond! Only the one who is still awake, will be able to answer, if at all!! You know, this can be argued as another example of oxymoron, like that \"life after death\". This makes me really wonder just how bizzare and being the root cause of all misfortune that human language really is — I have a strong feeling that language, is like arts, like the building in Kenneth Clark's Civilization, is the exact reflection of that era, that society, that group of people, the mindset, the logic, the emotion, and the outcomes that we are now calling them,history. Just by the front entrance of build 7 today, Scott was speaking to his colleague, a black woman, whom I have seen but never spoke to, and they walked to a different direction when Scoot and I greeted each other. The woman was in tears. I don't know what is happening. But seeing someone, even a stranger, in tears, makes me sad, makes the heart skip a beat, and makes me want to reach out, sit down with that person, offer him or her something, something comforting, something warm, something to calm down, something to assure that everything, will be alright. Yesterday while walking back from gym, I saw the cleaning girl standing by the building, just standing there. I was wondering, doesn't she, like me, like everything else I'm sure, that has a love in life, a love she had but not being together anymore, a love she memorizes sometimes, at night, and feeling a pain still inside? I'm sure everyone has. But then, why am I so tangled with the memories I have? the love I had? the person I missed? This is such a universal situation, such a common and general scenario, such a sure thing, then why, do we still struggle with it? have no solution to it? have no resolution to it? and have no way out of it once you are, in? This, is truly a mystery, a sad, mystery. Human emotion啊, when can we know what it really is? can we ever come out of the love agony? can we ever master one's memory — didn't I create it at the first place!? then why, it takes on its own life after creation, comes and goes at its own will, and runs wild, from one extreme to another, making me like a boat caught in a storm in the sea, up and down, up, and down, up, and down. Searching for \"how many emotions are there\" didn't give me an answer at all. Somewhere says there are four basic ones, and there are 42 muscles to compose them. I guess there isn't really a sure agreement yet. But it's there, so dominant, so central, so long lasting, so defining, so real, that, one can only cope with, when it hits, and wish to come out, alive. Honestly, sometimes, I wish, I will never come out, because missing someone again, for one day, is worse than being alive.

I have been using it for the last six months now writing a reference architecture document for work. Here is some tips of how I'm using it. doc header Things that are specific to that document. This, thus, is context sensitive — title , subtitle , author , bibliography , abstract , keywords . Example: title : Open Cloud Reference Architecture subtitle : Version 1.0 author : - Feng Xia bibliography : feng.bib keywords : [ Open Cloud ] abstract : | Anything goes here. One catch is semicolon in title ! Unbelievably, which I haven't figured out why, that including a \":\" in the title string will mess up export to PDF. The symptom you will see is that all your reference in .bib will not be found!! LaTex setting A universal setting to latex export. This is additional to the LaTex template file I use. Supposedly I can set all these in the template also. But if I'm using multiple template, this can be looked as the common settings for all the PDF I write. Here is current version . It looks like this: --- documentclass : scrreprt papersize : a4 mainfont : Ubuntu monofont : DejaVu Sans Condensed fontsize : 12pt geometry : margin=1in linkstyle : slanted linkcolor : #d52349 titlepage : true titlepage-color : \"FFFFFF\" titlepage-text-color : \"5C68C0\" titlepage-rule-color : \"5C68C0\" logo : \"../diagrams/company-logo.png\" toc : true toc-depth : 5 toc-own-page : true lof : true lot : true link-citations : true header-includes : - \\usepackage{quotchap} - \\usepackage{fvextra} - \\usepackage{parskip} - \\usepackage{fancyhdr} - \\pagestyle{fancy} - \\fancyhead{} - \\fancyfoot{} - \\fancyhead[L]{\\leftmark} - \\fancyhead[R]{\\today} - \\fancyfoot[R]{\\thepage} - \\renewcommand{\\headrulewidth}{0.4pt} - \\DefineVerbatimEnvironment{Highlighting}{Verbatim}{breaklines,commandchars=\\\\\\{\\}} - \\lstset{breaklines=true} - \\lstset{language=[Motorola68k]Assembler} - \\lstset{basicstyle=\\small\\ttfamily} - \\lstset{extendedchars=true} - \\lstset{tabsize=2} - \\lstset{columns=fixed} - \\lstset{showstringspaces=false} - \\lstset{frame=trbl} - \\lstset{frameround=tttt} - \\lstset{framesep=4pt} - \\lstset{numbers=left} - \\lstset{numberstyle=\\tiny\\ttfamily} - \\lstset{postbreak=\\raisebox{0ex}[0ex][0ex]{\\ensuremath{\\color{red}\\hookrightarrow\\space}}} --- LaTex template A massive LaTex writing that will be used to generate LaTex and PDF. As of writing, there are two templates I like: 1. eisvogel.tex , found here . 2. feng.tex , modified based on eisvogel , and modified to my favourate title page. BibTex Lesson learned, though late, is still useful, is the BibTex. Don't be lazy by using direct Markdown links to reference as hyperlink ← it doesn't cut it. Instead, use the .bib , it's much better, and is incremental , meaning your collection will grow, and it benefits to any follow up docs you will write and want to use the same source for reference! and to generate a bibliography now at the end of your doc is a snap, and it looks, beautiful! Example of .bib result in PDF Use the MIT's guide for format references. emacs + RefTex Found it here : ;; reftex in markdown mode ;; if this isn't already set in your .emacs ( setq reftex-default-bibliography ' ( \"/path/to/library.bib\" )) ;; define markdown citation formats ( defvar markdown-cite-format ) ( setq markdown-cite-format ' ( ( ?\\C-m . \"[@%l]\" ) ( ?p . \"[@%l]\" ) ( ?t . \"@%l\" ) ) ) ;; wrap reftex-citation with local variables for markdown format ( defun markdown-reftex-citation () ( interactive ) ( let (( reftex-cite-format markdown-cite-format ) ( reftex-cite-key-separator \"; @\" )) ( reftex-citation ))) ;; bind modified reftex-citation to C-c[, without enabling reftex-mode ;; https://www.gnu.org/software/auctex/manual/reftex/Citations-Outside-LaTeX.html#SEC31 ( add-hook 'markdown-mode-hook ( lambda () ( define-key markdown-mode-map \"\\C-c[\" 'markdown-reftex-citation ))) Once restarted emacs, use C-c[ then C-M to select a citation style, and type in a regex, eg. redhat- and ENTER. Viola, a list of matched entries to select, and ENTER again → [@redhat-rhhi-guide] . Nice ~~ Styles Wow, I never knew there are so many styles to choose from. The list I'm going by is here . For web URLs, I found the ieee with url is the only one that works. The biggest problem I see, is that web page does not have date (well, I guess they do, probably in its meta section, but I didn't bother to look into it). So other styles will render it as \"Red Hat, n.d\" → n.d for \"no date\"? Doesn't look nice. Makefile I can't remember all the pandoc CLI switches. Use make to compile multiple versions in one bang. Here is current version . Define macros at the beginning: latex_template := feng.tex rhhi_ra_pdf := feng \\ ra.pdf # espace white space! rhhi_ra_md := feng \\ ra.md To compile to PDF: pandoc latex.yaml $( rhhi_ra_md ) \\ --number-sections \\ --from markdown \\ -o $( rhhi_ra_pdf ) \\ --highlight-style pygments \\ --filter pandoc-fignos \\ --listings \\ --pdf-engine xelatex \\ --template $( latex_template ) \\ -M date = \"`date \" +%B %e, %Y \"`\" \\ --filter pandoc-citeproc \\ --csl $( csl ) To compile to DOCX: pandoc $( rhhi_ra_md ) \\ --from markdown \\ -o $( rhhi_ra_docx ) \\ --highlight-style pygments \\ --filter pandoc-fignos \\ --listings \\ --columns 10 \\ --filter pandoc-citeproc \\ --csl $( csl ) Workflow Quite simple: write → make → view → repeat. Cursed by WORD, and coworkers The pain, comes in when you need collaboration — ppl insist to use DOC and change tracking. Unbelievable. I think the biggest curse I have had in my professional training, is that I was introduced to the LaTex so early that I simply could not stand the WORD, which makes me the super minority in corporate world. I have been battling this all my career. I thought pandoc is gonna save the day, since I'm now dealing with technical people now. No avail. When it comes down to writing a paper , this generation, is trained to think of WORD, only. You see emails with attachment, and filename with a timestamp \"_0409\", then \"_0410\" as the next version — for me who uses SVN then git as the life line of work, this, is purely disaster ← every single time , somebody will do one the two things: Forgot to change the filename after an edit, thus now we have two files of the same name, but different contents. Forgot to send out the latest, review the latest, for, oh well, how would s/he know which is the latest!!? The convention is, of course, the last email attachment you received. Good luck. I give up this battle now at this point. Like teaching a kid — you can't really teach them. You just have to wait for them to grow up, if ever.","tags":"dev","url":"https://fengxia41103.github.io/myblog/pandoc%20workflow.html"},{"title":"Plagarism","text":"This is a stressful day. What a day! Everything started on the normal footing, until I looked at emails in the inbox and saw a comment of my writing being an offender of plagarism — wow! Indeed. Wow! I don't know what else I could say about it. Up to the point that I have built the exhaustive cross references I have ever known how and seen in any of the document generated by this company, and I know 99% of that document was written by me as the sole writer, and if there were any AI to do an analysis it would have found the style of my writing as if I were writing this blog — if you write things, you know there is a distinct way of wordings every writer bears, like it or not, like a finger print. And yet, plagarism. Wow. Actually, that's an easy defense to brush it off. What I'm really frustrated is the terrible mistake the team has made by not keeping up their own work and let the updates slip, so that the reviewer was working on the wrong version, thus missed all these fixes and likely was misled to such perception — how stupid!! and how incredibly irresponsible! Time and again, I have witnessed the China team fail to grasp the idea of engineering , that requires precision, deep thinking, lots of hard works to make pieces match, correct, accurate, and hopefully still elegant and easy to use, but by bluntly throw paperworks over the wall without ever looking, without ever even trying to understand the contents, without giving thoughts of how to make coordination better, easier, for next time at least, but falling into the same failure pattern, over and over and over. I truly believe now that engineering, management, are actually the same thing, because they require the same principle to be good ← essentially, whatever the virtue to make a good human being, is what would make a good engineer, or a manager, or a good husband, or a good wife.... it is really the same thing. Well, by putting in this way, unfortunately it can be derived that the percentage of such population is, quite low. The majority of the team, the company, the people you meet or know in life, will be guaranteed disappointing. I'm actually amazed how a bad judgment can be so common, even among supposedly smart people. I really don't get it. One thing I know for sure is that so called education doesn't change this at all — yes you can say it's the fault of a failed education, and degree certainly doesn't translate to good judgment. Yet, what's the alternative? what can a person have a good judgment? And when I say the word judgment, I don't mean like judgment day that will look over everything you did, and will make a call that is \"surely correct\" — what I mean is simply the subjective decision, the 判断 of a situation, imagine steps and where they can lead, and out of ambiguity to pick a path that turns out, by the person's historical track record, to be mostly good decisions, when looking back. This sounds easy, right? Isn't everyone already doing it? But there are paths that are so obviously wrong, that by just taking a couple steps in your mind, you will see all kinds of questions you don't know how to answer, and feel that this may not be a good idea. Yet, so many times, so many times, people take it as if they were blind! The truth is, I believe, that they don't have the capability to imagine that two steps and their potential consequences. Period. The lack of imagination, kills it. This is the exact trait of a young kid, you know!? and we can generally agree that kids in young age can not be trusted for their decision, because they are so short-term oriented, and so, detail-oriented. Over the weekend I had this conversation w/ Noah about something. I was using \"a couple\" as a description to make a point, and he corrected me immediately that \"it was [a number]\"... he totally didn't get what I was trying to make across, but firmly held on to be sure that the quoted number is correct . Kids, one can argue, is too young to have abstract thinking, being able to derive and to generalize. And here I am, dealing with a similar crowd who has no imagination, poor decisions, and genuinely not made for this line of work. I don't know. I'm tired. I'm the one who is going to be laughed at, I know. But I do think, even when the entire island thinks I'm insane, I still believe that it's the island that is not right, not me. Not because that I'm confident or even arrogant. No. It's the result that tells me so — when we go by their thoughts, bad things happen; when we go by my ways, good things happen. Well, now we have to justify by whose standard it is good or bad. Forget it. Let me just get over this fiasco. I'll never get myself into this mess again.","tags":"thoughts","url":"https://fengxia41103.github.io/myblog/plagarism.html"},{"title":"Browser proxy","text":"This is a common trick. Say we have local machine (A), and a remote machine (B). If we can SSH from A→B, we can reroute browser traffic from A to B, much quicker than X-windows. On A, ssh -vv -ND 8080 root@<B's IP> , then SSH login. -N : Do not execute a remote command. This is useful for just forwarding ports. -D [bind_address:]port : Specifies a local \"dynamic\" application-level port forwarding. This works by allocating a socket to listen to port on the local side, optionally bound to the specified bind_address. Whenever a connection is made to this port, the connection is forwarded over the secure channel, and the application protocol is then used to determine where to connect to from the remote machine. Cur‐ rently the SOCKS4 and SOCKS5 protocols are supported, and ssh will act as a SOCKS server. Only root can forward privileged ports. Dynamic port forward‐ ings can also be specified in the configuration file. IPv6 addresses can be specified by enclosing the address in square brackets. Only the superuser can forward privileged ports. By default, the local port is bound in accordance with the GatewayPorts setting. However, an explicit bind_address may be used to bind the connection to a specific address. The bind_address of \"localhost\" indicates that the listening port be bound for local use only, while an empty address or ‘*' indicates that the port should be available from all interfaces.

In this aftermath of the Nortre Dame fire, the idea of restoring the damage immediately comes to everybody's mind. Inevitably, however, there are always, two choices — to rebuild it as it was, or to build it as we want them, today? Obviously by posing them in front of you, you see the merits in both directions. Yet, as a historical trademark, the lean towards the former is much stronger than the latter. But this exactly raises a question that I want to talk about — history. I have been reading quite some history books, and in recent days start to read books written by historian on history. It is really fascinating, because I have never realized the word history is not as clear as it seems, at all! We have been taking for granted that history = old, = the past. But to think about it, if the event has already past, are we just reconstructing it today? After all, the writer was not necessarily a witness, a participant, or even born back then. Thus the whole idea of reconstruction is really a matter of a personal choice of materials and perception of how the event was unfolded, wasn't it!? If you walk in any book store and look at the \"history\" section, there are always books that describe the huge impact of a small, ordinary thing, that has changed the fate of mankind — chicken, sugar, rice, anything goes. If you think of it, it is hardly arguable that any in your life, as of today, is unimportant — really, name one thing in your life that you can go without, I mean, go without for the rest of your life.. well, abstract such as pain, suffering, poverty don't count. I mean, physical, things. So, this brings us back to the discussion that what to build for the Nortre Dame. First of all, can we really reconstruct as it were!? Hardly, or should we just say, impossible. For one, materials are different now from 800 years ago, so are the engineering. Therefore, the replica can be as truthful as all the blueprints are saying. Yet, it is different. It looks the same, but it is different, better, actually. Second, why should we? We admire its beauty because it reflected what was then. Exactly because such beauty has sustained time for so long, that we make it a close thing to eternity. But, if we fast forward 800 more years, wouldn't people want to see what represents, today, that we are currently living and breathing everyday, instead of an interpretation version of something we could only speculate? In other words, shouldn't the responsibility of architecture to be the document of that time, instead of some other time!? You can take any iconic construction, and see this logic applies — Ankor Wat, the Forbidden Palace, the Empire State building... each is a symbol of its time. It would be rather strange if the Ankor Wat was really built as a replica of another temple 800 years before it. I mean, it would be cool and alright. But, wouldn't we then lose the document of its own time? This makes me start to believe that each generation indeed bears the responsibility to be truthful to themselves — if they were ugly people, so be it, generate some ugly arts, as long as they did come from their heart and soul. I have been a critics of all the ugly Chinese modern buildings back then. Now writing this, I start to reflect on this point. I was biased. They, actually did their part in history. Though I don't like the result, but nonetheless, I'm not to be the judge. Nor even time could be the judge. But only the eyes of the some other generation down the line will fit to look at the era and say, \"Look, this is the icon of that century (that dynasty, that time, or that generation)\", and there will be no right or wrong, good or bad, but representative vs. one-of-kind outlier. This reminds the openining of Kenneth Clark's documentary, Civilization , that if to choose what can truthfully represent the time, it will be arts — not writing of any kind, but arts — buildings, paintings, music....even the bad ones, or shouldn't we say, especially the bad ones!? In general, they are more true than others, they always carry a strong emotion, have a strong message, always always being the cutting edge of what people felt at that time. So leave the taste out, they are the perfect ear marks. I don't love them in many cases; but they are wonderful, as history.","tags":"thoughts","url":"https://fengxia41103.github.io/myblog/history%20choice.html"},{"title":"Music","text":"There is magic in music. There is. I'm listening to this song, a song I have never heard of, and the singer I have never heard of. Yet, it makes me so sad, so sad. It's not the words, not the performance, not the story in a MTV, it's just the, notes, the music. What is it in music, that I can always feel so touched!? so connected!? This is the song she introduced me to. I have never heard of this till that day, and what a surprise to me. I should have known. No words can describe a music. It is, choking, when a song touches your soul. I think the moment of 2006 when Lei passed away is as fresh as that day.

How strange, I was just thinking of him this morning, wondering, for the millionth time, there were anything I could have done, to have changed all these. I don't know. Life is hard. Getting old is hard. Being old will be even harder. I'm afraid. I don't want to, I don't feel I have the strength to pull it through to the end, wherever the end might be. Many many times I have dreamed of a diagnosis of some kind of terminal ill that I then know my end is coming, is near. It's actually comforting to know it's going to, end. I admire those people who keep to be optimistic, to be hopeful, to look forward to a change, to a dream. I don't have those anymore. When did I change? I don't know. Could I have been different? what am I? I thought I have been true to myself. But if this is the true of me, then the path has indeed been designed to be a tough one. I should really be grateful, for I have owned so much, got so much, been given so much. Human is insatiable, I guess, so am I. It's not greed, well, it is, a form of greed, greed of love, greed of affection, greed of understanding. It is, so like everyone else, like the eternal truth, that greed. So.

Do you want to hear my opinion, or just want a debate!? The bottom of all these is a fundamental gap I have been perceiving all long in many settings, not just work, but in life in general, that many many many many people (yes, definitely too many) who lack the sheer capability take a thought one step further in their mind and put in more consideration by asking themselves what it could be like if I do this, or not to do this? You would think this is the natural way everybody thinks, that's how mind works, isn't it, by weighing options? But you will be surprised. I know I am. All the time I start to question whether I'm the odd ball on the island occupied by a tribe of insane, or of course, in their eyes I'm the insane one! Really, tell me, haven't you had such moment? I bet there is. This is super crazy, really. We are creating work for ourselves now, by making what I call shallow decisions that patches up things in, always , an emergency mode, while everybody runs around super busy, but the end result is nothing but a patched up work. Then, the worst. Everybody starts to pad each others' back, congratulate a job well done, yet another success, and move on, literally, without ever sitting down and review what went wrong, why they went wrong, anything we should learn and watch out for next time. Amazing, truly amazing! I'm impressed by such easy feeling of comfort, and start afresh everytime without feeling anything is wrong. Now writing these, I feel they are like Dory, who always sees the world a new one, every 7 seconds. How wonderful that will be! But, this is not engineering! This is not professional! and this is not even maturity! I'm not going into an even more disturbing conclusion that this is simply, purely, stupid! I'm having serious trouble to understand their mentality to brush off a problem without feeling what the heck , and have no curiosity to fix it. Then, tell me, what is going to be the next!? Well, I have an answer for you, the same fire drill in another 2 weeks, or 2 months, and we will trip at the same place, in the same pothole, and eventually, I guarantee you, the luck will run out, and shit will flow, and who is going to clean that up!? This is absolutely ridiculous. So, enough complaints, let's talk about what went wrong, in my opinion: seeking decision without giving details Everytime I see some one-liner email like this, \"so and so is broken, can we fix it\", or \"should we do so and so\", my blood pressure shoots off the roof — these are completely irresponsible, waste of time, solves nothing, email, that the only message I'm getting is, \"go do it, and it is all your responsibility, and I have none.\" Do you see it? How am I going to take any action, or give any opinion without having information — if so and so is broken, a list of questions pop into my mind: What is the symptom? What did you do? What are you trying to do? How did you come to the conclusion that it was broken? What was the reference of \"not broken\"? What have you already tried? What is your analysis of what might be the cause? How could we zoom in or eliminate/prove the cause? What is your suggestion? and preference? The bottom line is, help me to understand the situation, give me information, so I could be informed and make a suggestion based on my domain expertise. Just a question that \"can we fix it\" means nothing to me — you know what, this is a YES or NO question, so there are really two possible answers by definition. What if my default answer is, NO!? then what? do you have any better idea? If you do, then why not say them at the first place? and if you don't (and that's why you are asking me, right!?), then you have my answer, and go away. Happy? seeking decision but decision has been made Too many times question is posted to me as if it's seeking my opinion. However, as soon as the opinion is out, man, there come all kinds of relevant (but really irrelevant ) argument to essentially shoot it down because my answer is not what they want to hear — dead line, schedule, promise to customer, promise to manager, promise to so and so — I always wanted to just shuffle all these into their face, \"these are all your problems, not mine!\" I didn't make those promise, I didn't make those deadline, I'm hired to produce quality, not time. Yes, time. If you know anybody who can create time, I would love to talk to him/her, cause, really, time, I wish I could, create new, produce more, and go back (or even go forward, like a quick forward to death, if it is an option). All this type of BS leads to is just argument, and argument doesn't even add information, because each side has been pre-set to take a position, so just trying to hold position and convince the other party — this is not engineering discussion, this is a political debate for president, only one side is going to win, and one party to rule. This, is all, wrong. last words In the end, I think what is missing is the fundamental intellectual capability to perceive a path by doing it in mind, and by believing that your information is never perfect, thus listenning is a way of checking whether there is anything important thing you missed in others' arguments. Only when you think your points have covered the other's ground, should you be firm w/ your opinion and defend it — this, to me, is the definition of open-mindness. But sadly, I have only met less than a handful in my entire life who possesses this trait, naturally. The rest majority, and I'm sure this is representative of proportion of population who will have the (so now we are talking about, I don't know, 0.0001%? some minute number for sure). First time I heard from 高晓松 that the crowd (or the people) is actually the thing we should be alert for (警惕), I thought it was rather counter intuitive. However, the older I get, the more I start to realize, the majority, is not wise. The majority, creates mess, but they are perfectly content. It's the minority, who can't live w/ such mess, will end up cleaning them up.","tags":"thoughts","url":"https://fengxia41103.github.io/myblog/frustration.html"},{"title":"Stay connected","text":"It is indeed quite a long time, 21 years. A friend of mine reminded me that, this year has been the 21st year since we knew each other. This is also the age of the internet chat I would say, because we met each other online, as an early adopter of these chat applications, ICQ, which was the mother of all chat applications including the copycat, the Chinese QQ, and of course, now its sequel, the enormous Wechat. I don't know how our relationship survived the 21 years, during which many years we had zero contact, zero news of each other. Then when we started to talk to each other again last December, that I learned she was then staying in a village somewhere in the west of China doing some sort of volunteering work, we didn't feel too strange at all. But this isn't giving me a formula how to maintain the other relationships in life to be as long-living as this one. You can easily say that it takes two in a personal relationship, thus this case worked because both of us did not have a grudge against each other, and was quite neutral to either having it or not having it → no pressure, no expectation, thus no regret. Then, for many others, such condition does not exist, which make them improbably to continue or to resume. True, true. But also, I feel there is a fate, an element of uncontrollable destiny in play, that two trajectories happen to be far apart, but crossing still. Since last march I have been thinking why my marriage w/ Noah's mom would end up like this? what was the difference, or how it could have been different? On my part I had much hope, much expectation, much judgement, and much less tolerance. But how can two be together not having these traits? Is the connection of me and this friend that is more like a two drifting rocks in space living happily with or without the other is the way to last? Can it even be called a connection, because most part of the time we were really not, connected!? To think of it, the number might be impressive, but the density was, little. We could still claim that we know each other, but the reality is, I don't know much of her, her life, her circle, her agenda, her passion, anything, really. So there isn't really much there. But w/ Noah's mom, I still face everything accompanied w/ Noah's life — drop off at school, not doing or turning in homework, arrangement for a non-school day, spring break, summer break, need medication, shuttling to badminton, breakfast at Panera, grocery shopping, so on and so forth. Not that these are joyful and exciting. On the contrary, the only word I can think of is, grinding. But they are, heavy, solid, like a rock lying in the middle of the road, you can't go around it, you can't run over it, you can't ignore it, you can't pick another road, you can't have option not to deal with it → you have to get up, get down, use all your energy, tools, and sometimes even more than what you know, to remove it, clear the path, so you can make pass one single day — they are too real, too mercilessly confronting, and always they win. So there you have it, one that ties you down to the ground, you feel you have wings but you can never fly w/ that weight. And these long-time acquaintance, friend, ex this and ex that, reminds you how long it has been, how long you have survived, and checking whether there is any soul left in it, that's still beeping, still breathing. I have always had a feeling, that the end of my life will be like the author of the 红楼梦, or that movie, 芳华, that another woman I have long known, will be at side, leaning against each other.

Actually it is such a long time that it changes a person, almost completely ← looking back myself ten years ago, the life I had, the state I was in, the look, the body, the spirit, the activities, the people around me, the person I cared for... everything, has changed. How alarming! I remember telling Siqi of this theory while sitting on a stair in Shenzhen after a day's walking around — I felt such a wise person to say that, as if I figured out a secret of life. To her, this must sound like wisdom, cause her whole life hasn't been counted much in ten-year marks. But at the time I said it without realizing how brutal this also means, and how sad it is since nothing can be done to stop time, and nothing can be done to turn back — ten years, is such a long time, such a long time. But then, last night I started to count how I came to be ← if counting my life in this step, it only takes two ten-years from mid-20s to where I am today, not much at all really, no wonder I still remember clearly the days of twenty years ago, still struggle with the same type of things i struggled twenty years ago, still feel I was like twenty years ago, though in reality, everything has changed, everyone has gone. Life starts at 0, but the first ten doesn't leave much since you don't remember. Then the next ten, where Noah is in right now, he understands some, not much at all, still childish or child-like, immature, unthoughtful, lost touch of yourself like this morning that he wakes up early, sitting across the table to me at Panera doing his homework, but without know why he feels down (beats me! he is just a moody kid, sometimes I wonder), and how he should/could handle it, such a clueless, rough age. Then, we are counting the third ten-year already(!), the prime of life — wonderful time, young, healthy, full of energy, full of possibility, full of dream, hope, fantasy, full of adventure, full of bad decisions, trials and errors, full of excitements, full of false feeling of independence, surrounded by supports, from family, friends, foes, people who want to please you, who want to take advantage of you, who want to be close to you, who want to fool you, who genuinely like or love you, who, in most cases, are also in this same period of life, thus feeling you are all alike, and you are in sync with everybody, and you are not alone, and you strive to be the same, and even to stand out. You yearn for being alone, as if the crowd around you is suffocating. But dear, it's only because you haven't tasted the truth of loneliness — you can hardly be alone at this age, that's why you feel being alone is different, cooler, and wiser. Wait till the loneliness comes to you, surrounds you, and drowns you. It's not fun. Then, the fourth ten-year, 30-40 now. Not bad, family, kid, marriage, more adult like now, feels life could be like this, forever, busy, perhaps, career driven, most likely, as if in reach to grab the next fortune, to become the next world-changing person. But anxiety, really unimportant trivia like family, wife, husband, kids, all the wonderful things really, that start to turn color and become a source of frustration. Then, without knowing much, 40s, the fifth ten-year now in life. Boy, don't I feel old now! I can hardly imagine when I'm in 50s, a common definition that I'll then be an old guy! My Goad, how scary — too quickly, too soon. Before you can be ready (and how can anyone be ready for this!?), it's here. No more the same body, same look, same health, same possibility, same hopefulness. Everything seems to be becoming to its end, slowing down, ramping down, turning off, losing ground. You look back, quite some miles you have covered; looking forward, quite some miles ahead. But the fun part of the journey is over, and why should I continue on then? So this is life, counting in ten-years, such a short short short time. Ten years, so long that everything is changed; so short, that you only could to the fifth to be old. Is life long, or short then!? It's short, I would say, short for it doesn't give you a second chance, doesn't give you back what you have lost, doesn't make you stronger, better, just older, older so that you reason, to yourself, you don't need that strength anymore. But the truth is, it's not too long, nor too short. Its only fault is that there were moments in it that you wish to stay, but can not. Like the moment we sit at the stair talking about this ten-year marks; like the trip to this unknown temple that even locals don't visit; like the recording booth in the middle of this busy, loud, arcade; like the crazily chilly weekend the cold front hit the city; like watching over the city night from top of this little hill, feeling the breeze of an early spring; like riding on the back seat of bus after saying farewell to the poor little thing who passed in our caring... if only could be kept, could be replayed, could be relived.","tags":"thoughts","url":"https://fengxia41103.github.io/myblog/ten%20years.html"},{"title":"Ordinary","text":"Have you had a funny feeling on someday, that something is happening, to someone, someone that jumps to your mind at the first thought when you had that feeling? That's how I felt today. I don't know what it is. If looking at this line I just wrote, I would have criticized that this is complete pointless statement because it is always, true — yes, something is always happening, to someone, and yes there might be one who jumps to your mind, but then, isn't it just coincidence!? I would say so. But, but, this is, somehow, different. It is a feeling of someone, that, someone, that you know you care about, you worry about, you think of, and you want to know, to find out, to hear from, to be next to. That the thought that something is happening to him/her makes you, uneasy. Maybe it's just being selfish, but maybe, it's just that, you care. I do. I care, even though it's as remote as I care about a star traveling too fast in space and will burn out a million years too soon — the star flies along, with or without me sitting here to worry about it, and it burns however it feels so, with or without me having a feeling or another. Its life will take its course, and it has nothing to do w/ me, w/ mine. Yet, I look at this star, somewhere, there, and I can't help thinking of it, wishing it would be alright, wishing it would be safe, sound, happy. Coming back from gym, a guy was walking in front of me. Nothing special, just another ordinary mid-age guy. Suddenly I was thinking, doesn't he also have someone on him mind, in his heart, that he hold dear, like me holding you? Why not? Shouldn't anyone have such a person to cherish? Wouldn't anyone have one s/he loves, loved? Why should I be anything special? In their eyes, amn't I just another ordinary guy walking on the street, maybe even somewhat repulsive, self-important, and terrible to deal with? If so, wouldn't it make that missing you is really the worst I could do, because you deserve so much more that what I have ← you should be with, should be missed by, someone, extraordinary, someone far better, far smarter, far talented, than I am. I wish I could write these to you, and you can read it someday. There are so much that come through my mind each day, sometimes each moment, that I could only speak to you as if you lived inside me, like an inner voice, that you could hear, and you could understand. Yet, it's so unlikely that you will ever see all these, probably wouldn't care anyway. It's ok. So to only jog down these words that have occurred to me, while I'm walking in the sun during a chilly Spring Friday, sitting at this (fake) Starbucks in the office when the area is unusually quiet, caught in between the morning coffee rush and the lunch crowd, listening to a song I have listened many many many time, and having you on my mind, to think of, to talk to, to feel, that something is happening in your life, that can still disturb my soul, makes me sad, makes me uneasy, makes me wonder. Just an ordinary day, for this world. But never an ordinary day, for me, because you are always, special. So the star that flies by, travel safe, burn safe, live safe. Wherever you are, I will miss you; whatever is happening, I will be on your side.","tags":"thoughts","url":"https://fengxia41103.github.io/myblog/ordinary.html"},{"title":"City life","text":"I find it curious. Listening to a sentimental talk show on the Netease music app, the kind that a young woman's pretty face as the icon, and a soothing voice that suggest the picture you see is her, and slow, relaxing, late night style light music in the background, and always topics of thoughts, quite like what I have from time to time, about life, about love, about career, about purpose, about why the suffering and why the choice. On the one hand, I feel she is too young to be really understand the depth of these topics. I can't help having the sense that this is 为说 新词强说愁, and many of the arguments are actually, false, in my opinion, because there is an underline assumption that she is not even touching (or making it obvious that she is aware of such assumption). For example, a popular sentiment is the anxiety of young people who is living a city life — so called stress from work, from struggling, especially if struggling alone, from unfair treatment by the boss, by the peers, by the city culture overall. Then, the counter side is always \"but she gives up a nice easy life in her home town and chose to come to Shanghai... because she is not ready to live a repetitive life as her parents (and other friends)..\" and so on. So here is one huge assumption that home town life will be easy and quiet, that she can \"go home at 5 and be with parents and spend the night watching TV\". Well, if we now examine this assumption , it's obvious this is not true, in many many ways. First of all, small town life is not a rosy picture, at all. Small social circle also means closer ties, less privacy, and higher peer pressure. You will have more extra hands to help, but also extra voices to listen to, to show respect to, to follow a stricter social hierachy, to meet a less flexible expectation, to deal w/ tighter control of your each step as if the rail has been laid, for you... by the way, nobody said that less uncertainty equals less stress. Honestly, I simply do not buy such theory at all — this is the same as those talk show of history constantly remind us that life in the Song dynasty was a wonderful. Give me a break! I bet even a nobody is living a better life than the kings back then, better health at least, better dental, better toilet... so the same goes w/ these small town fantasy. If home town life were all gain but no loss, I would seriously consider it a world wonder, cause till today, nothing like this has been found yet. Second, feeling loneliness and being alone, is terrible, but is universal, and is necessary. This is not a city disease. On the contrary, being surrounded by friends and family is suffocating and unhealthy. Let me ask this, how are you forming your own opinion on things if you don't have the chance to read and hear from less opinionated source (ok, I know all news are opinions, in a way, but better than a complete opinion from, anyone, parent, relatives, friends, foes, anyone), and have time to think? City is cruel, it is distant, it does not care you and me, it is cold. But it teaches you to look inward, to talk to yourself, to cope with yourself, and to know yourself. It's hard, unpleasant, but necessary, because at the end of day, the only person you know well is yourself, the one who will not leave you, is yourself, and the one who will put dinner on your table, is yourself. I don't enjoy the loneliness a bit. But it's inevitable, sooner or later, in life, that I have to face, to survive. Those who are hoping to dodge this bullet, will be disappointed. Now, on the other side of my thoughts on this, is that there is a common theme that occurs from generation to generation, from year to year, from day to day, from person to person — the wish of going back in time, missing the past, whether it was a youth, a young love, a wonderful time in life... why? From the picture and sound of this woman, she is in her 20s I would guess. So really there isn't much to go back to, when I'm speaking from my age. Yet, I remember the feeling, I echo the thoughts, I agree with her sentiments, and I wish to do the same. Sometimes I wonder when I hit 70s, which is another 20 some years later, looking back, wouldn't I wish I could come back to, today!? But now being here, being right now, I don't want to be, here, now, but to go back to a moment in time. How self-conflicting! What is this that we want to go back to? Don't we actually only implying a particular moment, period, but nothing before, nothing after? And even for that moment and that period, aren't we also thinking only a person being there, but no other noises , so the experience will be pure, even abstract? I think so. It is cherry picking only the things you like, but can get away with things you don't. Logically speaking, this is the same that I despise those history talks — Song was fine, but not everyday. If to relive the glory of a moment, great. But for over 200 years of days, and it would be safe to bet they also had 24 hours each day, and feeling hungry as regular as we do today, life, most of them, were filled with things from Pandora's box. So city likely amplifies these things, and accelerates the pace that you must face reality. The real question is always — do you want to know, and be unhappy? or be ignorant, and be happy?","tags":"thoughts","url":"https://fengxia41103.github.io/myblog/city%20life.html"},{"title":"What is your song","text":"Have you ever felt, that someday, there is a song, that makes you think of, someone? And this song, always, always, reminds of, of that person, regardless how remote and how far it has been. Somehow, this person, is tied to this tune, to a scene in your head, in your memory, that you can still recall the moment you first heard it, as if the first time you met him/her, the first time you went out, the first time you had fun at park, playing arcade, watching a video, sharing a dessert, drinking coffee, window shopping, or just wondering around in the city, by the suburb, along an unknown road that led to somewhere, but neither of you cared, because it was the moment being next to each other mattered, and you could go anywhere with him/her, however where the road is going to lead. Isn't it love? or just a 心动? or it's the beginning of a love, that is always beautiful, touching, making your soul nervous, tremble even, and leave a stamp on your memory, that you can not forget, even when it's buried deep, in history, in the past, in neglect, in a corner of mind that doesn't see light of the day anymore. Yet, the song, is like a key, that opens a door that had been sealed with dust, letting light peek into once more, as if someone stepping into an ancient ruin, they see spider webs, see things scattered around, see broken pieces here and there, and then, they also see the same as it was left — placed in the same place, in the same position, clock stopped in time, nothing changed, but everything has changed, gone. How sad! So this is the power of a song, the power of remembering what you had, the power of not being able to forget. There is an army of sci-fi movies that travel back in time or forward into the future. It's a cliché now if you set a story in this setting. But what people often do not realize is that, everyone of us, every mind that lives and breathes, every heart that has ever been touched by another body, every tune that makes you sad, makes you wonder, makes you want to drop everything you ever had, only if you could be back with, or to be with, someone, somewhere, someday, is traveling, in space, in time. Yes, it is sad. But it is also beautiful, because it is tender, it is sensitive, it is what makes you feel to cry, and I have to say, tear, is a wonderful thing. It's not cowardish to cry. It is rather noble, for you still feel the pain, still remember the pain, still hope it could have been different, even though it is set, done, finished, no going back. They say Athena put HOPE as the last gift in Pandora's box as a savior to human; some argue that HOPE is just another evil (so don't be fooled by its name), otherwise why it was in that box? I don't know. Maybe it is. Then this is an evil that gives you a string to hang on, even though, it is false.","tags":"thoughts","url":"https://fengxia41103.github.io/myblog/what%20is%20your%20song.html"},{"title":"Human grouping","text":"How curious! Human, I do mean the general population whom I observe in various settings, always get excited by a thing, a place, another person, that has practically speaking nothing to do with him/her , but yet, they are so eager to make a connection with that thing, that place, that person, that they even feel proud! You bet. Any idol groups can testify this — you idol has developed a skill, whether it's dance, or look, or scandal, or talent, or hoax, is really, his/her doing. But when you are labeling ourself that \"yes I love you! I'm your no. #1 fan!\", well, what does it give you anything, I mean, anything, in reality, but a virtual link that you know this person (sure, and love this person), but the harsh reality is, this person, your idol, do not know you, and whatever s/he has developed, was probably caused by you (or people like you), but do not belong to you, nor will give it you. If you are even willing to go the distance that \"oh s/he is sharing this with fans\", or that \"s/he actually knows who I am\", wonderful! But again, I would argue that this is the same logic as those terrible 富二代 ← they are so proud of their wealth, but they didn't earn a dime that they are squandering. I guess the only thing they deserve to be proud of is that they had luck to be born in a rich family. Well, luck is important I admit. The same saying goes when 袁老师 criticizes those people who are proud of a mountain or a lake that their area has &larrr God has placed such wonder there, which really had nothing to with you (well, in all cased, the creation was done without ever had you in mind, don't you agree!?) So what's for you to be proud of!? What can make you proud, however, should be something coming out of yourself, based on your own effort, even be it a extreme luck, that you moved a finger, and caused it to happen, such as education, such as being a good flute player, or a runner, or a kind-hearted person, or being brave, having integrity, being honest... something, something of you, that you have struggled with, battled with, worked on. The rest — beauty, look, smarter brain, better hair, taller in height, quicker in reflex, better in weight (or worse in weight) ← all these, were born with, that you did not have a say in making that decision. Nature did. So there isn't really anything you can feel proud of (or ashamed of). Period. But then, we all want to be connected with someone, something, extraordinary — \"I know who and who\", \"Yeah I use that app (long before they got popular)\" \"I read a great book (written by whom and whom)\" \"I love his movie/music/muscle/moustache\".... as if now, we are part of that ring, that circle,that we now share the fortune and fame and good luck and whatever! We are so uncomfortable with ourselves that we have to prove ourselves only through a reflection of such claims. Why!? Don't we all also struggle to buy a unique piece of cloth, or a unique talent, or an above-average something, anything, so to be outstanding, standing out, different!? Then why bother to associate with any of these other stuff as if they are also defining you!? Why, do we need an identity, at all!? Just to know who I am? what I should do? What if I just don't know who I am!? what if I just got a wrong answer but not knowing it for the rest of life? what if I change identities once a while, or all the time? Does it, then, change anything!? We all know names are just made up labels. People who believe a good name can bring (or change) one's life is quite, optimistic, and probably will always be true — life is indeed a butterfly effect, you never know what a dial will make some part of your life vibrate, shaping up, or shaping down. There is no turning back, and there is no peek into the future. Every step, every decision, every moment, every thought, every move, every blink, every breath, is a blow into this mystery that can change your course. How scary! and how powerless! Just learned a phrase that anger is because you are mad at your own's incompetency. Very true. I feel angry, sad, depressed, frustrated these days. Often they felt it's someone else's fault that caused all these — pretty much the same argument Noah gave me when he is caught doing something wrong. Yet, in reality, it's me being angry at myself for being so powerless to change, to influence, to make things happen (the way I wish), to be with the person I love, to take care the people I care, to be nice and forgiving to many, to be happy with myself. Indeed, the feeling this powerless sense is the root of anger. So, it seems human are destined to be angry, if one chooses to be objective. Alternatively, let's (pretend to) define an identity, by associating myself with something, great, somewhere, great, someone, great, to think about it, even the volunteer work I'm thinking to do, isn't it just another thing I'm trying to be associated with, as part of my identity!? Siqi said she is often influenced by people around her. I used to think she will grow out of this. Now, I would say, there is no growing out of it ← I'm needing an identity too, by deflecting all these external things onto myself. We can't live without a self-image, I guess. We, maybe, can choose the mirrors to use. But even that, is shaky. I always worried that she will be surrounded by people I don't think they deserve to be near her. But what do I know? My mirrors are not necessarily better, and the bottom line, I don't know what identity she wants. If beggars can not be choosers, then we are all just begging for an identity, and we don't get to choose which. We can work hard to be a good student, to have good education, to be smarter than what nature gives us, to be a good person. Not that you can choose to be one, but you ended up having a few good mirrors around, and that makes you, look better.","tags":"thoughts","url":"https://fengxia41103.github.io/myblog/human%20grouping.html"},{"title":"Self-disciplined","text":"This is pretty amazing — \"Google killed 2.3 billion ‘bad ads' in 2018, down 28% from 2017\". I'm thinking the sheer number and complexity involves to make detection, and to take action against these 2.3 billion bad Ads. This is an absolute tech challenge, not to mention the principle that drives such intention, and the willingness to put down something like this to cleanse oneself. I know Google has always had the Don't be evil motto, which I found quite impressive when first heard of it. This is hard. I mean, this is an ambiguous term — what is evil? who be the judge? and what should you do about it? Google's number revenue is still its Ads, and yet this 2.3B bad ads are not just noises, but toxics that will pollute the market, and thus killing its cash source. So you could argue that Google has every incentive to take this action. But this faces the exact same question raised — who determines good or bad? and if we take it into the free-market argument, wouldn't the free market force distill these bad guys because they will not get enough business, and will then be phased out? Apparently, the Internet, or the Google's Ad market, is telling us otherwise → the free market force is not sufficient to self regulate its own health ← it simply can not keep up with the number of bad guys who are equally creative and smart, and have stronger motivation to game the system for advantage. The only defense is an arms race — that by putting a clear policy upfront as requirement to participate in this market, and an efficient police force to monitor and rule out violations. We used to scold these 城管 because they have absolute power over under-powered street peddlers, and as Acton said, \"Power corrupts; absolute power corrupts absolutly\", this is inevitable. However, it is unclear either alternative is a better picture. We are assuming street peddlers are morally sounder than these 城管 due to their weakness. Of course, this is not true — an averaged distribution of demographics is more likely to be true than false among these population, or any group, if no other data to back it up. Further, even if this is true, it says nothing about the shift of such high moral standard once they are granted w/ more power! As a matter of fact, history has proven too many times that what corrupts a person is exact the transition from a low position to a high position. So, what other options? Police force? I hate this idea, but this logic seems to be the conclusion we are drawing ← if you can't discipline yourself, then an external force must be introduced. Call it police, or whatever you want, but that doesn't change the nature of this force, nor why it was introduced at first place. Then, what about this force now being granted with absolute power? Isn't it the 城管 we just mentioned? or an authoritarian regime? I mean, it can take many forms, but ingredient maintains. I don't think I will like that at all. I don't think this is even the debate of democracy vs. non-democracy. This is a paradox of how to main order. We all agree we want to maintain order. I just argued that we can't self-discipline sufficiently to avoid a police force. I'm worried police force gains absolute power. Then what? A police of a police? then another layer on top? and on and on and on. I really should read Alice in Wonderland. Now everywhere I turn, every topic I write, seems to be an analogy of an endless rabbit hole. Maybe it's my analytical thinking is the problem — just too dumb to figure it out, but too smart to be content with ignorance. It's the dilemma of me — caught in between, not alive, not dead.","tags":"thoughts","url":"https://fengxia41103.github.io/myblog/self-disciplined.html"},{"title":"Self-esteem","text":"I start to understand now, better perhaps, than before, that what self-esteem feels like, and why women have this anxiety of so. With aging I start to notice that hair is becoming less, and this has been bothering me for the last few weeks when I started to notice it. Not that I'm going bald or anything, just that comparing to what I had, it feels, less. Then, all of sudden, I start to realize this is exactly how women feel all along in their life, that they want to lose weight, they want to look young! I have always laughed at such attempt, calling it a lost battle because there is really no point of trying so, for that first of all it doesn't really change who they are, no man is going to love or not love you just because you have a few extra pounds. Actually, most of them who are bothered by their \"weight\" look just fine, really, in my eyes at least, there is not obesity or anything even close to that mark, so the crying is more like a crying wolf to me, and probably to most men! and also, honestly even though all men love girls in their young 20s, grown ups also understand that what is important is who you are, is the mind, not the body, and the desperation of making the face look young will only make the wrinkles on the neck or hand even more standing out ← it's like that empire who walks around naked but may be having a perfect hairdo, so what's the point. But now, I think I see better. All these, regardless it's hair, or wrinkle, or weight, or whatever that may be bothering you, the underline message is the same, that there is something you don't have control over (aging, after all, is the most natural outcome one can expect, besides death, and arguably tax, but that's a man-made thing so I would discount it some, thought it's the most surely thing, and the most annoying thing!), and it is in a conflicting course of an image you would like yourself to possess. So there are two folds of this line — an image you project for yourself, and a unstoppable force to destroy that image. Rationally if the force is beyond one's control, the only alternative is to change the projection, isn't it!? But here where human mind gets tangled and anxious. We are so clinging onto that projection that our entire so called self-esteem is based on it, and without self-esteem, well, the life is really like a house of cards — it collapses by taking just one card away, especially one from the bottom, such as this self-esteem thing. It's lucky for men, most of them, that they are so immature in their young that they all feel great about themselves, had an illusion that they are the most handsome, coolest guy, by looking into a mirror to admire one's face, hair, or expansive car, or sport, or just that man's organ, while at the same age, women, on the other hand, are living in anxiety for their weight, for their under-developed or over developed breast, for their \"imperfect\" figure, for not having that handbag, or a lip stick, or a coat that fits this year's fashion, and so on ← so the feeling of anxiety starts much much much earlier for women than for men, how unfortunate this is! But then, this long agony of living with anxiety also make women, wiser, more mature, and more self-aware. Many men, even in their 30s, 40s, or even older, live like a kid who never grew up — they take themselves to be the center of the universe, and live by their imaginary image, perfectly in peace, and proud of themselves, while their wives, girlfriends, lovers, mistresses, daughters, see through all these and are in struggle to fight off the uncomfort such realization brings. Jessie said that ignorance is a bless. Indeed. If only I could always live in such a bless, by not knowing so much, not thinking so much, not being so self-aware, life would be a much happier journey than me now worrying about such a nuance as a hair! Yes one can also argue that this is only so because I'm not wise enough to think OVER these thoughts. Once I become truly wise, such thing certainly doesn't bother me a bit anymore. Well, true and true. At the meantime, I'm also thinking, if anxiety has made women a smarter group comparing to men, maybe, it's a good thing to have → that I'm not bloated to believe in that I'm the handsomest person on earth, and will become humble, truer of who I am, what I can and can not do, and in the end, a more honest person, I hope, than without such pain. I don't know. Giving up a self-made image is hard. I don't think we need to. But we can look back to ourselves in a better mirror, though you don't look good in that mirror, it's one better than fooling ourselves, or being fooled — we are all, and just, who we are, no more, and no less. At least, that's what others see.","tags":"thoughts","url":"https://fengxia41103.github.io/myblog/self-esteem.html"},{"title":"Rain rain rain","text":"Rain, rain, rain. Not quite actually. It's cloudy, misty, and is about to rain. Nothing really special for an early Spring day. Some flowers have bloomed, and some are on their way. Like walking in this mist, reminds me the days I was wondering around in Suzhou, the college spring break when I was still young. Hard to believe it is the 25th anniversary since graduation! My god, 25 years, what have I done!? It is such a long time, yet, I feel I have achieve little, changed much, and what I have is as little as what I had. I start to understand why parents will feel their children being the only, or the most proud of, accomplishment they have in their life — I probably will feel so, too, because the child is the only thing you must stick around, can't easily call a quit (well, for a responsible parent of course), so once you persist it for like 10 or 20 years, looking back, you can't help feeling proud of yourself, feeling that is an accomplishment ← indeed it is! This makes me wonder, and probably it is true since there are many talks about it that being persistent is the hardest, and the only way to achieve something extraordinary (well, hardly we will say all kids are extraordinary. But in reality, raising them to adulthood itself is extraordinary, when was the last time you did anything for 20 years without budging, without quiting, and still doing it!?). So, I guess if we can take anything and keep doing it for 20 years, we can call it an achievement! But then, sadly, after 25 years since college, I experienced much, traveled, hopped jobs, dated, married, divorced, cried, laughed, switched hobbies, suffered some, achieve some, gave up some, held on some, kept some, lost some, remember some, forgot.. maybe some, too, and, the only thing I could feel as an achievement, remotely, is that Noah is 11 years old, not that I never thought about quiting (and I'm about to walk away by giving myself the excuse of doing volunteer works, somewhere, just not here), but I hadn't had the gut, nor the determination, to leave. So I sticked around, and being his dad for 11 years, and counting still. So that's how life awards a person ← by making it hard, and hard to quit, it gives you something, likely the only thing, you will find worth feeling proud of at the end of life. But if you go by your own will, you feel happy from moment to moment, but like a happy banquet, it felt great at the time, then, it left you with little impression, no scar, no hurt feeling, but its satisfaction lasts for, 4 hours? then, you feel hungry again, need food again, and sadly, no banquet, no food, of any kind, will taste good if you eat it ever time you feel so. But pain, agony, regret, lost love, feeling of missing someone, the distant memory of walking in the rain, of picking up at airport, of the moment I saw you flashing by to pick up your luggage, of putting scarf around you before walking out to a chilly Shanghai winter day, of following you hovering on your segaway, of seeing the surprise on your face when you came home and discovered the wonderful smell was coming from our kitchen.. they linger, they persist, they probably will fade, or will be gone entirely when I'm like Dad losing all my sense and memory. How sad. But even so, they will be the last to go. So I hope, so I wish, so I pray, the image of you, be the last thing leaving my mind. Then, it will all be empty, blank, and that should be the end of my existence, as me. The body may continue to drag on. But without the thought of you when I ever walked in a rain, in a misty early Spring day, there is no soul, and I would feel nothing anymore. Every drop of rain in the air, every mist floating around, every flower come and go, every season, every cloud, every day, is only a transformation, of you, so I wish it to be.","tags":"thoughts","url":"https://fengxia41103.github.io/myblog/rain%20rain%20rain.html"},{"title":"What is engineering","text":"I have been thinking, and probably being pissed off at the current status of the work, that whether the concept of engineering in my mind is the problem, or what I perceive is correct and it's the others who are not getting it. So, what is engineering? I recall back in high school when we were to enter the application for college. Being a naive spoiled kid back then, I had no idea what I wanted to do, nor what myself is or can be good at. I remember my dad told me that after meeting with my teacher 班主任, the guy felt I could be good at engineering. \"What a nonsense!\" I thought. I had no idea what engineering requires, had little interest in engineering (though my parents both were engineers), and certainly didn't think myself fit that profile at all — Noah's absent-mindness everyday constantly reminds me what I was like back then. So if anything, I was as far from being a good engineer as an engineer could possibly be. But, things change, I guess, and people do change (! what a surprise!). Growing up I found myself being more and more intolerable of the non-detail-oriented person and things, and wanted everything to be fitting in an organized way, in a well-oiled smooth operation, and taking proud when things work, and feeling frustrated when things aren't. When I draw diagrams, I like things to be aligned to grid , and the connectors snapped to another shape so they will move together without shifting position. I will make sure all labels have the same text alignment, both vertically and horizontally, and shapes in a row must be evenly spaced, and lines must be consistently the same size, so are the fonts, and so on and on. And Powerpoints, I can't believe how many times engineers, who have been known to be non-artistic type, are willingly to propel such bias against themselves by delivering a slide that is ugly because details such as alignment is not even right!!! You know, whenever I saw something like that, I wanted to scream !!! → for God sake, you call yourself an engineer, and yet you can't even get a slide right, how could I trust you to build a next jet engine, or write code claiming to be good quality!? You know, I firmly believe in consistency ← I think a person is, and must be, and better be, consistent, which means that if you do your laundry messily, have a messy car, I will simply discard you for being possibly a good engineer. Period! Because things like this speaks a threshold of tolerance of mess — all the ones I just mentioned tell me that you have a high tolerance of it, which, well, in engineering, I believe is a terrible news. What is engineering then? At this point I believe engineering is everything to fit together and work as it should. In GRE we learned the trick that whenever you see an answer says everything , it must be wrong, because there isn't such as possibility as everything . Well, engineering is exactly trying to achieve this impossibility, and that's why it is hard, very very very hard. When I saw emails or heard discussion that \"oh it's broken, let's fix it\", I just want to shout it out that \"come on guys! what is broken? how is it broken? how did you judge it is broken? what is the reference of not broken !? what is the thought/analysis/guess of why so? and any ideas how to rule out possibilities of cause and find the problem? and any backup plan if we fail to find the cause, any action we can take to isolate the problem? or to alleviate it?\"... I don 't get it, really! To me, a vague statement of \"it's broken\" is not only meaningless, but aggravating, and honestly, I think it is the problem itself!! → exactly because of the mentality of such non-detail oriented statement (I would go even further to say that whoever makes such statement is completely irresponsible, in engineering term!), will, and must have, driven the work and process that has created this problem at the first place! I'm amazed how many times people are rushed, or willingly rush into, a work without considering left and right how many pieces we are dealing with, how these pieces can fit together, how they can go wrong, what is the assumption, how to verify these assumptions.... These types of questions pop to my mind as soon as I start hearing even a faint proposal. Yet, for many, I do mean, many many many, others, they don't even occur to them, never bothered by them, and then get everybody, the whole team, into a fire drill mode, as if this is what engineering is about — putting out fire because things are broken! Yes, things being broken is the constant status of engineer's life; No , if fire is not becoming rarer and less severe, we are not engineers, we are criminal who is setting out fires, for ourselves, so to keep us employed, and appear to be busy! What a BS! I'm really curious how they had built Golden Gate Bridge back then? or the Sydney Bridge? or any of those enigneering marvels!? How could they pull it off with work of hundreds, thousands, of people/labor, yet, the things all came together, fit! Looking at them, you will see, engineering.","tags":"thoughts","url":"https://fengxia41103.github.io/myblog/what%20is%20engineering.html"},{"title":"Strange fate","text":"Have you had this feeling before? that something is off, and things are happening in a strange way? This is how I felt yesterday and the day before. Went to see a medical surgeon to take care of that bump on the back of my head. At parking lot, out of the twenty some years of driving a car, I ended up stepping forward and ran over a curb, and of the entire way back home, I felt my mind was just somewhere. I didn't know what was happening, just that strange feeling that my mind was off, off. Then at night at the end of scrum, Eric asked me whether I have seen his email. So I found this email, that came from some BS email address: KANDULA . VENKATA NARENDRA REDDY < bugbounty10378 @gmail . com > and it has caused an uproar inside the company that some trade secret has been leaked by rouge developer and such, myself included (well, technically yes, but then, the internal analysis said that I'm no longer working here... so much a joke for taking the matter seriously!). Instead of anyone questioning the legitimacy and credibility of this strange looking BS email address, every single on on that email thread acted as if something terribly immoral and wrong had just happened: Please provide an overview of what the GITHub project was being used for? Please provide an overview of the functionality and type of information the source code was used to access? Please indicate who authorized you to store the source code and information in GIT Hub? So it turned out that it was a code I pushed into my gitlab account to showoff the REACTjs way of building a dashboard based on YAML config, and the example config files had these so called sensitive data that this bugbounty10378 guy, for whatever purpose (but honestly, doesn't this count like a blackmail of a kind!? what the heck is this email!? and why would anyone take it seriously!? Just some random guy scanning github for a string pattern <company name>.com , and then for something like a URL, or a username? a pwd?) For God sake, let me give a legitimate URL we are using internally in our development which controls million dollar worth of equipment: http://10.240.44.48 ... does it mean anything to you!? to anyone!? and how about I give you my credential for a kick, fxiaeo942423, bbba39430w908 ? Go have fun! This is turning into a witch hunt, and everyone is acting seriously to show his/her value in the command chain, while, the only message I got for being an active developer — don't write any code! The more you write, the more likely you will miss one line or two in your git commit in which you had put an internal URL, a user account credential, and so on. And to make things even worse, these commit histories are permanent, like a prisoner's tattoo on your face, done. Yes, it is a security hazzard, no doubt about that; No, no developer in his/her sane mode is consciously committing a crime here. If you folks have ever written a code and made a commit, you know the zillion if-else you had to take care of, the grueling hours of debugging to make it work , and the relief when the code is finally pushed to git ... well, at the end of all the exhausting hours, remembering to comb through all the code again so to mosaic all these sensntive data, is the last thing on dev's mind; besides, having them there is likely the only way to get the code working, even though dev knows it's just for now, and it's bad practice, s/he is afraid to touch code, even to change a newline, can break it! Well, that's the sad reality of software engineering. For all the uproar people who jumped on this bounty thread, maybe you should take a working code, mask all these data you care about, and QA it to make sure it's still working, before dev can commit such a sin. Honestly, I would love someone to distilll my code to make it, safe. If you know Python, and Ansible, and REACTjs, and jQuery, and materialized CSS, and Django, and Postgresql, and Celery, and Tower, and Satellite, and a few other technologies/applications I'm dealing w/ everyday, email me, pls. I would love to meet you, and maybe you can work for me.

Last time I had this moment was in 2004 just before I was leaving for Beijing. Fourteen years later, there they are again, glittering, haven't changed. There must be an interlink between humans. I can't believe that a movie like Fahrenheit 11/9 would have made me to stop in the middle because, watching people cry is so, tough. I don't know. Does everybody feel this way, I wonder? I'm sure they do. We know movies are touching, so are some entertainment shows, that having somebody cry always make the audiences, weep, and freeze, and make the moment memorable. So this must be universal. What about in real life? I have seen people cry, someone close to me, some just strangers passing by, but why I feel more touched when watching them on screen instead of seeing them live? Is it the music? the story line? the close-up view angle that you don't get to see in reality? the moment of a sudden silence when movie maker removed all the background noise, no one talks, no one even moves, it is only this person, occupying the entire view of your eyes, who is, weeping, and even more so when s/he is trying to hold it back because of the camera — these, make the moment, so much more, powerful. So I feel touched, feel sad, feel the agony, the sympathy, the feeling to weep together... how strange! Then, there was she, the dearest to my soul, who cried and cried, and I felt nothing but guilt, a tremendous weight on my mind, on my heart, that I wanted to stop it, to stop whatever that caused her unhappiness, even if that means to fight the world, to die, or to leave. It's hard. I wish I could tear more, cause I know it carries your sadness out so you don't accumulate them inside. Yet, I can't. My mind is always so logical and calm that it hardly get to the point to tear. Yet, I am watching is documentary that isn't even a good one. But when the interviewee was crying, I felt this pain, so great, that I had to stop the movie and write these down! I guess that speaks that I still have some emotion left, that I am capable to be humane and to connect with someone. It's not kindness I would say; it's just human nature, that has not yet gone by grinding life. How much can we retain? and can we get it back later once we become, relaxed, different, or just passing the bump of that grinding life? I don't know. I hope they don't just ever reduce but can never be refilled. I hope not. Emotion, is indeed the only thing that defines a person, defines you, and me. Maybe, one day, we could save tears, save them, even on camera, or etching in mind, like I have done, that the same image will be replayed, over, and over, and over, as a reminder to yourself, that there is someone you can feel, there is some moments you don't forget, and there are tears that makes you cry, because you still love.","tags":"thoughts","url":"https://fengxia41103.github.io/myblog/tears.html"},{"title":"Forget someone","text":"Forget someone, is hard. Your image kept popping into my head this morning, on treadmill, on a path walked from building to building, in the sun, by the shadow of a tree, in the cold winter air, or warmth of a ray that brings one of billion-th of energy for the universe all the way to my body, a branch without leaves but is secretly preparing to welcome the inevitable Spring, a bird flying by, some geese who have started migrating north, or my cats who snuggle by my side last night while I was having a late night call, and getting up with me when he thought I was going to reahch out more midnight snack for him.... You are, everywhere, will not pass, will not forget. Why is it so? Looking back, I hardly have forgotten anyone w/ whom I have devoted time and love to, from the first girl I met, to you. I wonder whether this is just me, or this is human nature that everyone is capable of, but someone choose not to, and someone does? or is it a capability that one is good at, while others don't? and can you gain or improve this capability by, practice? or just born with a fixed value that will, in a way, define you !? I don't know. It certainly like an attribute that I have lived with, and will not change. Maybe I don't want to change — who should I forget all these people, these people in my life who, at one point or another, were so important to me, so close to me, that definitely defined who I was, and led to who I am!? Why should I let it pass into some oblivion? If I'm looking at Dad, I constant felt that there is a stranger living in his body, because he has lost his conscience to recollect his past, and without them, what defines him anymore!? I don't want that. Thinking of you is hard. You feel so far away, and I can't pull myself together if I start to wonder where you are, what you do, how you are going by your life, and whom is by your side... But I can't help it. You, took a spot in my mind, in my life, and that spot, is so wonderful, so deep, that, if one day I could not find it anymore, I will be lost. If that happens, my dear 美丽的人, the true me has never forgotten, by the year, the month, the day, the minute, the second, the every single elapse of mind, of moment in life; the one who forgets, is not me anymore.

I was talking to Noah about this this morning — why one feels the time in the morning always flies by? Theoretically time is uniform, it ticks by the second all the time, at the same pace. It doesn't change over the course of a day, so why morning time feels short? Well, we are not talking about bad days that you felt like indefinite long, but just a regular Wednesday morning. So here is my theory: I think time feels different because your brain is operating at a different speed → in the morning, your brain is slow to boot up, thus the constant flow of time feels a speed train passing you by, again, this is arguably the perception of time by your brain (exactly). On the flip side, time will then feel short when your brain is working at a higher speed. The experience will be when you are in the zone of writing code or doing something, that you forgot about time and felt it was really short! I'm sure everybody will echo this experience. Following this logic, the feeling of time should be defined as an efficiency factor , or density , or velocity ,, of experience, that within a fixed number of ticks, the more your brain worked and perceived, the higher the density, that the shorter the time feels. Interesting. I wonder whether this is what relativity theory says? So, what is really time? Is it just another aspect of perception like I have just said. We know it is a complete artificial thing, because there isn't such a thing called TIME in nature. I like the motto of Movado swatches that there isn't really 24 hours a day, just a fact that sun rises and sets everyday, which then defines the notion of time. Therefore there is a single dot on its watch's face that represents, sun? and the minute and hour arms just go by it that simulates sun rise and sun set. How genuine! Time, thus, is really a human invention, and quite an arbitrary one, that we divide time into 24 hours a day. Actually this hasn't been always the case either. We know at different time and by society people had used different calendar; so many have used different ways to describe time — how about bars on a prison wall, or a marks on a tree bark! They are all indication of elapse of, time! 24-hour day is just one of many ways human have used, and happens to be the going standard when I'm writing this. The problem at its core is a math one ← earth doesn't go around sun in a nicely rounded integer value (well, integer is another human invention to describe nature, so it seems human is caught by his own inventions) So regardless how we are wishing to give it a good chunk, say 24, or 16, or 17.5 even, there is always a bit of residual to count in order to make it accurate — accurate in the sense that what human makes of it matches what nature shows (think of solar year , aka. tropical year, that has 365.24219 days, or, be precise, ephemeris days ). So you, every single noun in such statement is essentially another human invention that is to describe a, thing, which requires definition, and if only all the definitions are hold true at the same time, will such a statement be true and meaningful (well, even the word \"meaningful\" or \"true\" requires definition and scrutiny! How convoluted human language has become!!!!!) In the book Seventy Great Inventions of the Ancient World , it talks quite a bit of examples of time, such as the Maya Calendar . So if you are not yet convinced that time is subjective , read it. I can't find who said this, that the root of human tragedy is that the wise takes every step full of hesitation, while the fool take every resolutely (智慧的人每一步都犹豫不决，愚蠢的人每一步都步伐坚定) .","tags":"thoughts","url":"https://fengxia41103.github.io/myblog/time.html"},{"title":"Bizzare logic","text":"U want know some bizzare logic? Here is one, from a terrible ridiculous argument w/ Noah's mom. She said at dinner table that she has applied two charter schools for Noah. I then asked what are these two schools, and want to know more about them. We talked about Noah's middle school assignment, and she was mentioning that charter school could be an option. I was rather glad that she took an initiative, unlike before she wouldn't do anything but to ask me to make a decision. However, this conversation derailed to the point that it was becoming really bizzare. So she started telling me how bad west carry, the one that Noah got assigned to go this year. So I said this is not what I'm asking; I'm asking to know more about these two schools. Then she started to say that I asked in such a challenging tone, that in the end the conclusion was that I didn't respect her. Why so? Because, according to her, I didn't listen and didn't try to understand her. While I often said that she didn't tell me much, therefore making it impossible for me to understand her. Here, the table is turned, that I didn't understand her because I didn't try hard enough. There it is, the logic — Me : you don't tell me anything, so I don't understand you; She : not that I didn't tell you anything, but you didn't try hard enough to listen; Me : I listened, but you don't say anything, so what to listen to? She : I told you, but you didn't try hard enough. How wonderfully bizzare ← You don't understand, because you didn't try hard enough. This, is driving me, crazy.. well, it was, but not anymore. I'm so grateful that we ended this relationship last year, officially, so I don't get bothered by the idea that I'm still in this bizzare loop, and have to deal with it as if this is important! No, it is not only not important, it is utterly, bizzare! This is truly an argument that has no ending. It will just go on and on and on and on. If one perceives another as not listening, I don't think there is anything one can do to change it. But then, perception, she got really worked up when I concluded that everything is really just perception, nothing you can do about, you are at the mercy of the other party how s/he perceives your words — it can be taken as a wonderful communication and just what is needed, or, it can be perceived as having no information, no content, and not answering the question at all. Honestly, I really think everything, good or bad or whatever, is completly a perception. But she disagree. I guess the only way to disagree is that she still believes there is an objective truth, fact, that you are not trying hard enough to be good, to listen, to understand her mind. But to me, I tried, I heard nothing, and this sad result, can only be my perception — I mean, what else could it be!!? I asked the question for information, and it turned out that I am not listening !? Isn't this, bizzare, or what!? PS. Surprisingly, I have written about logic already.","tags":"thoughts","url":"https://fengxia41103.github.io/myblog/bizzare%20logic.html"},{"title":"human and perception","text":"I'm finding myself battling my own perception these days, a lot. Perception isn't a new topic to me. I have analyzed in hurt feeling whether it is a reasonable action for Noah's mom to feel hurt because of something I did, well, at least based on her claim. But still, perception is such a fundamental thing of human, that in this trip w/ Noah, and in the last few days when he and I were both recovering from jetlag, this is the only thing I could think of to reason how I had lost patience w/ him, and started to dislike more and more of myself → perception, is the evil cause of all human unhappiness. Cambodia, and the image of that place, was constantly on my mind this morning. Watched two documentaries yesterday — save my seoul , and one that talks about child trafficking in Siem Reap, the city Noah and I just visited. And this morning Noah and I were watching this really strange, and rather too realistic japanese movie called Happy Hour , in which four female friends, all in their 30s, are going through their life and struggles, like everyone of us on this planet, real, dull, pain, and 无奈. Then, everytime when someone cried in the screen, I could feel the emotion, if not touching and bringing myself to tears, at least, it would feel awkward, that makes you want to run away. What is it? Why human, on one hand sooo deeply touched and connected with another human being, even if the other one is only an image, a virtual strange in a screen!? I don't know him/her, but I felt the upset, the tide of emotion that this person is going through. Is this sympathy? imagination? Is this the final link that keep us sane, that deep down in our soul there is a connection to each other, however remote we become, how ever far we drift apart, however different we all are, there is a string of humanity holding us together? But then, why human also act in the completly opposite way, that being cruel to each other, indifferent, deceiving, even many times outwright bullying and humiliating!? Why? and what makes one doing one more than the other? Do we have all have both sides on us, just that social rule, education, self-discipline, and any other random idea that comes across my path, that reins me from being the bad one? Well, isn't also these random idea that defines what is good and what is bad? So they are their own judge and you are being put in a race one couldn't win!? What is it? Why can someone achieve such a noble thing, like the guy in the The Last Samurai who has such a firm belief in their cause, and acted with their soul and heart? and at the same time, someone who tramped on everything to get his gain, but justified just the same? The guy in this Happy Hour movie who is divorcing one of the women. He is a rigid scientist, but honestly I couldn't see what is bad about him — and yet, all the women seem to see through him and criticized him for being cold and impossible to live with! I don't understand their POV, but I'm sure they have a point, otherwise, why they say and act so uniformly, and being full confidence in their statement? ← I'm not one who can be convinced easily. But I would admit their conclusion even though I don't understand a bit of how they derived their points. How bizarre! Then Noah got up really early in morning, partly due to his jetlag, partly because he could watch TV. I told him that he was a good boy at Taikang because there were night shift staff entertain him if he got up early. So being fair, it was really just my perception of him being a good boy because I didn't have to get up w/ him and keep him entertained! So really, his being good or bad is nothing but a result of my own's condition → when I'm well rested and lighthearted, I find him pleasant, smart, the best travel buddy to have; then, I'm tired, grumpy, occupied by memory and criticism of his mom's handling of him, I put on a negative lens... So in the end, he has always been, him; it's me who has shifted from one end of the happiness spectrum to the other, and venting my frustration and annoyance on him, and this, is what I'm battling w/ — my own perception . So in the end, one is the enemy of his/her own. It is not bipolar; it is nature. Like what I'm convinced that one's weakness is bound to be the strength, I'm also convinced, that what I'm feeling is not only natural, but insolvable. I can only feel and sense this world through perception. It is the only way to function and react. Yet, it is also the thing that creates an emotion in you, that makes this world an unhappy place, and myself an unpleasant person to be.

So here it is. Take it as a \"Thank you\" note, or just a plain letter, from someone who had the privilege live with this crew for a few weeks, being able to see and hear what your day is like, and want you to know how wonderful you really are. If you have ever in doubt of your job and the life you are giving to these patients in your nursing, I hope you will find my letter comforting, and encouraging. Not that I want to pump you up by persuading how important your job is; but by pointing out a fact that each time when I visited, including this time, that I noticed the mark this work has left on you — a small wrinkle, a gray hair, a look from lacking sleep, a body that speaks \"I'm tired\" yet you keep giving to these people as if this is your first day. I feel sad. But I know what these have been translated to — it's the healthy look on my dad, the better walk of another 爷爷/奶奶, a recovery from another flu by somebody, and the clean/pleasant smell on these people who have lost control over life, but you are a string to tie them from slipping down. It is a daunting task you have decided to take. It is only for us to observe how a lunch madness can be, how testing it is to feed when s/he chooses to go with their own mind, leaving you sitting there and wonder how such a difficult and unrewarding thing to spend your life on. \"Why can't he just open that mouth, and let me feed!\", I wanted to scream sometimes. But I have seen nothing comparing to you. I could only imagine how you could still put up a smily face and joke about it, and be nice and friendly to them, to each other, and to this life.It is not easy — this, I must say, is a complete understatement. This, is mission impossible, for you to keep an upbeat spirit day and night, literally, when you are here, and to be as responsible and as responsive as you have been everyday. But indeed, you did it, you are doing it. For this, I truly admire your endurance and your spirit, because this is the side of humanity that I don't find much anymore in anywhere outside this place. Coming to here is like coming home, and it is really each of you who made it feel home. What is home? — A place you feel warmth, feel safe, feel peace. I think you will be laughing at me now that I use the word peace to describe your day. It is anything but peaceful. Yet, my dear friends, you don't know how much peace you have created for us, for us families and friends whose life will have been an utter chaos if not because of your existence. Without 19th floor and you, it could only be despair. This is home, it makes me feel warm, makes me feel safe, makes me feel, peace. I wish Noah would grow up someday liking this type of work, and be like one of you who can makes a difference in others' life. If parents always want the best for their child, this place and this experience will be the best one could give him. Next time when I knock on the door, some will look familiar, some will be strangers. I will see more gray hairs perhaps, more wrinkles, more tired looks... I know I'll feel sad, probably so are you, and we will see each other how much life has changed us, and yet, how little these patients have changed — in physics, they say the total mass in this universe is a constant. I wonder maybe love is, also, that by giving away so much by you, the people here are kept from becoming empty. Thank you for letting us stay and being part of this. Truly, Feng & Noah","tags":"thoughts","url":"https://fengxia41103.github.io/myblog/taikang%202019.html"},{"title":"Operating systems","text":"Let me talk about OS. This has been an annoying topic recently due to the ZTE fiasco, which to me is a running joke on its own — one billion dollar fine , and we got nothing but a bunch of BS articles circulating on in wechat that arouses nationalistic sentiments with conspiracy theory, but nothing else. The common focus point of these arguments are two things — OS, and CPU. When they talk about CPU, as if there is only one maker called Intel, and if only China could have developed its own CPU, the threat is over. Well, this is a totally ignorant assumption because, first of all, Intel is just one of many CPU manufacturers, where is AMD, where is GPU, do they even know what type of workloads are now running on what hardware? There are army of these chips, each designed for its specific purpose. The CPU you can buy at Micro Center is but a tiny tip of an iceberg, it's a general purpose at best, and even this I would suspect that it is not — every design has a tradeoff, say performance vs. power consumption, or footprint vs. cost, therefore it is not general purpose at all in these senses. It can be called a general purpose to its workload, but only means that it's mediocore for all workloads, and is not tweaked for any — everybody gets 60 out of 100, but forget about a 100/100. Well, then, I would ask these BS authors, is this really what you are asking for? is this the state you think that will save this country!? I don't think you even know what you are talking about. Not to mention, when we talk about chips, which is a broad word, like IT , that covers more than one industry, not more than one company! There are micro controllers (Motorola), DSP (TI), FPGA (Xilinx), SOC, and god knows how many other such programmable embedded thing we are actually using daily even in our life — just look around, there is microwave oven, refrig, TV remote control, AC, car radio, your phone, smart watch, now even smart home devices... all these, are programmed with some software, so that it has a certain application logic to react to a human input. None of these, is running on an Intel CPU. So there you have it, I cease my case on CPU. Now, let's look at operating system. Again, the same logic fallacy is seen here — there are an army of operating systems out there . If you look up the word \"cloud joke\", the number one popular comic is: \"Cloud is mostly made of Linux servers\" , get it? China has attempted RedFlag Linux back in 2000, when I was really impressed by it because it used a Windows-like desktop management UI so laptop vendors at 中关村 can sell their thing without infringing Microsoft's IP. At that time it was even bragged that government is to move to this platform so to become independent from MS ← doesn't this sound familiar now!? The difficulty of operating system is not a technical one at all. If you look the list above, you will be surprised to think how all these can all work, and many you haven't even heard of ← no offense, let me just ask you this, have you used BSD? or Solaris? ... well, these are not only in broad use, but is super powerful, and in many technical ways superior to MS Win. Period. So pls, stop talking about OS as if you know. You know nothing. If there is one OS you should care about, then it is not MS at all. Linux is the king on the Internet, and it's open source! So don't even bother inventing your own, you will be quite impressive if only you could understand and keep up w/ Linux core itself! RedFlag tried it, and failed probably, so go for it, it's a lot harder than writing those BS articles! Further, the challenge of OS is not even technical, but purely business — operating system is responsible to provide a base for hardware-to-software interface. The key is how compatible an OS is with gazillion of hardware varieties and vendors out there. Let's say you have just invented your own super OS, will my PCI audio card work? and wifi module? and camera? and even memory, some data bus, USB, bluetooth, when I plug in my USB microphone for gaming, will it be recognized and work? and my HP printer?.... the list goes on and on and on. People dont realize, when his/her computer works so effortlessly that all these peripherals work magically, is the result of a tremendous collaboration between OS maker and hardware vendors -- hardware vendor will have no incentive whatsoever to write a driver for your OS unless your OS is popular. Then, alternatively, you will have to write your own! So, have you written USB drivers before? are you ready to commit time, resource, $$ to cover, say 100 hardwares you see in popular laptops? If even leveraging an existing open source one, such as Linux, has failed, then I would say it's hard pressed to make me believe you can pull off without even realizing the task ahead! If we take all these development as a whole and give it a score of 100, I would say writing OS is like 10%, or even 5%, while the rest are about making it compatible with hardware your OS needs to support . That, honestly, is not only technically hard, but simply impossible business wise! If only China owns every single hardware piece in that computer, and enforce these vendors to write code to support your OS, I can best your OS will flop. Period. And I bet you haven't thought of the risk if this even became true — if you build a machine like this, then you have to drag this entire vertical chain over to keep up with all these other development industry is rolling out constantly — new protocol, new bus strategy, new hardware new software, new data format, so on and on and on.. you will be left in dust sooner than you think! People, please, stop talking about things you don't know, and definitely stop dressing it in such a nationalist tone. This doesn't help to fix the issue. Instead, do your homework, learn your code, think hard and pay as much to details as possible. This is the only way to become good, if you are good, and lucky. Everything else, is just BS.","tags":"thoughts","url":"https://fengxia41103.github.io/myblog/operating%20systems.html"},{"title":"Details","text":"Devils are indeed in details. Watching a Japanese movie Fire on the Plain , it suddenly reminded me a topic I have always wanted to write about — you know, when we are listening to the wonderful story of the Three Kingdoms, and fancy how powerful China was, and how you could also be a hero, neither the author, nor anyone has lived off these stories, such as nowadays talk show hosts, bother to mention to you at all, that if there were indeed an army of that size — a few hundred thousands, or even millions, how terrible the smell their camp must have been! Yes. We heard in 评书 of 埋锅造饭, and there are many stories about how an army can run out of food, and how you can raid your enemy's food line to arouse a panic. But, no one has described the other end of the human digest system — shits! Literally. If you eat, you shit. They have to come out, somehow, some way, some day. No exception. As a matter of fact, I would even fancy (well, I'm using the word \"fancy\" because myself never had experience of starvation, thus can only speculate) that holding shit from coming out is more difficult than enduring a few days of hunger. I can totally see myself skip a few meals to survive, and even happy (ask Noah and he will definitely agree), but holding from toilet for a few days!?.... very unlikely. So there it is. If I were a general back in those days, I could tell the size of an army by counting how smelly their camp was. Especially back then public health was a thing never heard of. My friend in Tibet is still struggling w/ a resident without a proper toilet to go to, in 21st century, then what's the odds that ancient army has such a discipline to deal with that!? Further, if such knowledge and practice has existed and has been used in such a massive scale ← we are talking about a lot of people, males mostly, concentrated in a tight space and in a short period of time, then why not we never heard about anything in books? in talks? The people, so called fighters, existed with a curious attribute that they have all the other human features except this one thing! How wonderful! Think about it. If they didn't dig toilet, then the camp would be a massive shit dump! Will the tent next to you care anything about you stepping onto their shits!? probably not. So everyone takes his path of lease resistence — being the most convenient for him, at that emergency moment, and forget about social etiquete! Then what will that camp look like? smell like? errrr............ Now someone will say, oh, they have toilet like we do. Then, let's say how many these facilities they will have!? It has be many many many, because, when you live w/ even a few thousand people, the ground it takes to have all these people lie down is quite large. Therefore, are you going to walk across a few miles just to pee!? Maybe not. So there must be a facility near you or your group. Well, then this becomes a math exercise: for an army of 100,000, let's say 100 people share a toilet, then there needs to be, 1000 toilets! and you know what, digging those things are not that easy! and what about when you are marching into a territory in which digging a toilet is not possible, say, winter in New England!? Everytime when I watched movie that soldiers are ambushing an enemy by lying and waiting for hours there, I was always wondering, what if I need to pee right now? or shit? Pee might be ok. But shit!? I mean, I can do that, but that smell will give away our position, right!? and it won't be just me, what if quite a few of my band of brothers had the same need!? Details, details, details. I looked at Vietnam war movies, and saw American barracks. They make sense. There is toilet. But in China's grand military stories, no one shits, physically. This is fxxx miracle.","tags":"thoughts","url":"https://fengxia41103.github.io/myblog/details.html"},{"title":"Thank me","text":"This is a curious thing. Maybe I'm thinking too much again. So at the dinner table, two women sitting next to me asked me to open a jar for her. Sure thing, The there is a girl sitting across to us on another table said, \"turn it upside down and hit bottom a couple times.\" Well, I tried first to open it without doing anything, it didn't open. So I know exactly what it will take, just hit the lid on table edge slightly, and after that, since the girl was saying so, I turned it upside down, hit bottom a couple times, and after a few seconds of struggle, the lid came off. The woman who requested this job said, \"还是小姑娘利害\"... errr... credit This gets me thinking, why? why people care about credits? why such a comment will make me think more than once? is that because it bothers me? but then, I couldn't care less what she said in return, or whether credits go to the young girl who chipped in an advice, which I knew for sure will not work (because this is not a Snapple bottle, and I'm sure her experience is from that kind of opener), and hitting lid will leak air, thus balancing air pressure of the jar, and that's what makes it possible to open the lid. Well, but I won't, and won't be able to, explain all these to them. So the woman had no sense of thanking me for the hard work, and the girl said nothing and took full credits. Awkward, isn't it? But why did that happen? and isn't there other moments in life that this exact same scenario plays? How about someone comments how well doing your son is, and you are happy, because without saying, you, the parents, own all the credits? But is that so, at all? what about his teacher at school? or his friend at YMCA? or a butterfly effect that any minute affair can just change your life, so what you have today, see today, is really an accumulation of all these little events, encounters, combined!? then what about credits to these people? Even if you want to send them all the thanks and appreciations, it is impossible to execute. So these hidden influencers, will not get any credits. How unfair! This is really strange. But we all know we care about getting a thank you when you did, or you thought you did, something good. This is exact the problem of a broken marriage, in which two become out of sync of who is doing whom a favor, and who owes whom a thank you, or an apology! Therefore, it's only logical to argue that such expectation is built in, that it is only natural for you think and to expect that way, thus, will be disappointed when it doesn't happen. In other words, the annoyances, or even hate, is a logical result of you having such expectation at the first place. But you don't get to choose not having such built-ins at all. Just like another thought I realized yesterday — life is such a misery, that you don't get to choose its beginning, nor its ending (as of today), then it will only be extremely foolish to believe that you have control over the process in between! The truth must be, you don't. So, what is life about? A journey you are put through, no choice, no option. Then, what's the odds that it is already written, somewhere, by someone!? Very likely I would say. pattern, control Then, there is another interesting conversation I picked up the other day. A nurse at Taikang was commenting that she \"figured out\" a 规率 of a patient, and this is common in daily conversations. The speaker usually showed a face of pride, and it is taken as a positive comment because it feels we now understand a pattern, and feels we are now in control → we can next time manage this, better. This definitely makes me believe, that seeking a pattern, is another built-in feature of human — we are actively looking for patterns, summarizing in order to formulate a pattern, and without a pattern, which in my mind is a repeatable process or action, we don't have management. Period. But having pattern, or thinking that we have a pattern, gives us a false sense of being in control! I would simply argue that seeing a pattern is a clue to figure out a causal effect relationship, but it does not logically yield better management at all — and for being in control, well, I have just said in previous section that we simply do not have any control. Period. So, how many of these human built-ins are there, I wonder!? I feel we know so little about ourselves, that it can leave people like me to wonder, to 胡说八道, to entertain myself with these words, these thoughts, and leaving myself a laughing stock for God or anyone else for that matter. If only I could even be a joke, so at least it makes someone smile ← wait a minute, then, do I get a \"thank you\"!?? ....","tags":"thoughts","url":"https://fengxia41103.github.io/myblog/thank%20me.html"},{"title":"Wife material","text":"Traveling reveals one thing to me. I don't know whether this is unique to me, or it is common to many people, guys especially. I start to realize that, regardless which space I am in, let's say, in a shuttle bus, or a subway, or an airport, or a country like Cambodia, there are always women, and among them, somehow, there is always one that you will find attractive, like to look at a few more times. It's a pleasant feeling, but also feels strange in a social context, that feels like a pervert. But honestly, it just happens. I step into this space, observe, start to be aware of people around me, then violla, over there, there is this one person that you will just realize, that she is good looking (in sense of relativity of course), and you want to see more of her. How interesting! I start to see this pattern over and over and over again. Even while touring some random tourist site, there is always someone that catches my eyes. Why? Is this a common thing for all male animals, and what about females? Are they feeling the same way? I'm really wondering that in a closed space of any kind, human will find a mate. If so, I would only guess that this is really driven by instinct, by some native builtin desire.

I can't recall it anymore. It felt like a strange memory. Do you know when you are staring at clouds, you feel it is moving towards you, becoming larger and larger, and some part of it is always moving, changing, like 棉絮, how fascinating! Last night's street food definitely had a toll on both of us. Swimming a bit helped, but I could still feel the cranking at stomach, and Noah is taking a nap next by the pool. These traveling young couple decided to have lunch at the hotel's restaurant. I could smell the perfume the girl is wearing. Beautiful weather, a bit hot, but beautiful. I don't think we can ask more from nature for a better life. Noah had a sharp observation the other day, that there is no cars honking! Yes indeed. The whole city, regardless the zillion bikes, scooters, motorcycles, kids on every kind on every kind of these, cars, street dogs, chickens... it feels, life, but not noisy. The air smells burning fire from street food stalls and grocery markets. This place is poor, but it has a pleasant smell, a relaxing feel. The girl's fragrance is becoming another string of this city smell. How far can smell travel? how long can it last? I know smell can burn into memory, deep, that I recall walking in Beijing park w/ mom a few years back when she was showing me those flowers. All of sudden I recall the smell. You couldn't tell where you had that before, but you know it. Clouds are floating by, together, with this fragrance in the air, and the city bustles in the background. Sun rays over the swimming pool, a butterfly going anywhere she feels please. When will this happen again? and when will I recall? Went to a coffee shop on the way to scooter rental place this morning. Both Noah and I didn't feel well. So we stopped this place for a recharge. It's gift shop is really nice. Got a string bag, just what I wanted for trip like this! and a wallet made out of rubber tire, which I thought it was thick leather. How wonderful! I guess it is from one of the recycle programs that locals make these artifacs, and sell to support a program. It's good cause I hope. It doesn't really matter that much. I liked the place, liked the morning walk w/ Noah, liked the small gift shop and the two post cards I picked. They are over priced by local standard I'm sure. But I want to leave something to this country, to this beautiful place, because, it had given me so much in my first vist, w/ her, and has given me beautiful clouds and a pleasant smell. She didn't wear perfume. I don't need that to remind me of everything. I remember, still.","tags":"thoughts","url":"https://fengxia41103.github.io/myblog/watching%20clouds.html"},{"title":"Turning a cycle","text":"Life is turning a cycle. Landed in Siem Reap w/ Noah last night. Immigration was at snail speed, reminded me what I have already forgotten — perhaps it was just as slow, but w/ her, time flew by. There were a young Japanese couple on the shuttle bus going from terminal to the airplane. What a love in the air! How wonderful to see couples in love, however their lives may play out to be. They are just, wonderfully, happy. The country has not changed, and it has changed much. Watching scooters and motorcycles going by this morning while Noah and I were sitting at the hotel's breakfast place enjoyin g fancy meal, I think the people are dressing better, the vehicles look better, and young staffs are having a fancier hairdo and accessories than I remembered. I hope this country will do well. It is such a beautiful place, with such a lovely people, how can they be forgotten so they must suffer? It's unfair, and I hope there will be their turn. Everywhere I turn, I see sign of poverty, see sign of their past. Even in this fancy place, the bamboo curtain hanging on the back this building look too original to be a decor, and the yard next to where I'm sitting by this nice looking pool — wild grasses, bushes, deserted. I think that must have been what this hotel location used to look like. Yet, breakfast menu is so westernized, and you can see so hard they are trying to satisfy their customer , that it's even sad that I didn't see much of Cambodia flavors ← what do they eat at home? It can't be the egg bendict w/ coffee! Was chatting w/ Taikang staff of western influence the other day. My point was that you don't need to try hard if other people think what you do is great → they will pick up, they will learn. I think there must be a term of this western influence ← maybe it's called the curse of the western civilization ? It's said that people are trying to meet western standard in order to show their progress, their modernization ← it's inevitable. But then, I was watching scooters, bikes, pedestrians, people. \"Not many cars yet. But what will it be when there is?\" They would have to widen the street, which at this moment can form at most a two lane traffic. One side is this hotel. By the time this needs to be happen, I would guess the hotel will be doing pretty well. So this is unlikely to be destroyed. Then what? On the other side of this street, there are trees, open land, parks ← these, will be wiped out, in name of progress and development. Wouldn't that be sad? The scene that I'm seeing today, will be no more. When will she be back to this country, someday? What will she think of these? or the trip we took together? Will she be sitting by a pool, giving some thoughts to what I'm thinking? or, maybe the world has already changed above recognition? I wish I would know, or wish she would write them down, or tell me, somehow. How much I wish to know more about her life, the one that is unfolding, the one that she is destined to live? I don't know how many more times I would come back to this country. Too many places and time and moments are now tied w/ memory of her, that wherever I turn, wherever I go, wherever I will end up to be, there is always a silhouette, accompanying me. Noah is by my side working on his homework. Nice breeze. A pleasant smell in the air, a bit like smoke from food cooking, a bit of just urban smell. I was here; I am here. What is missing, and is missed, is you.","tags":"thoughts","url":"https://fengxia41103.github.io/myblog/turning%20a%20cycle.html"},{"title":"2018","text":"First photo of the Earth taken by NASA in 1968 Last day of 2018. Snowed yesterday. Amazingly the snow accumulated over night, and Shanghai is now looking pretty, covered in white, and fresh air. Listening to Xmas music in Starbucks, with Noah reading his comic book next to me. It's quiet. The shop just opened. I thought it was already opened at 7, but it turned out we were the first customers. I like it, peaceful and quiet, and holiday in the air. Sent you a message on the way over. I saw the snow, and that is forever linked with you. I can see your face brighten up and your prettiness is captured in someone's camera. Yes, this is what you will like, and I am happy to imagine how happy you will be. What more can I ask about life, when I have this type of rather luxury life, where the person I love, Noah, is next to me, and I am able to spend some time w/ Dad? Though I don't know where you are anymore. At least, we are in the same city, breathing the same air, seeing the same snow, and in the same space in a sense that I know you are here, and maybe, you will think of me, too. End of 2018. Another year. I dont' get excited over holidays anymore. I looked at my camera this morning. Even though I have just bought a few more lenses, I don't think I'm becoming a good photographer — I'm not taking pictures, and I dont' have fire burning inside me. I don't have an audience in mind for whom I am going to show and talk about these pictures, experience, and imagine her face, her smell, her reaction. Without that, I feel nothing but emptiness, a void. I know you are still there, like living in my soul. Yet, you are becoming so silent that I'm afraid I will have moments I don't hear your voice anymore in my mind. Reading the \"One Hundred Years of Solitude\", what a tough book! I was constantly reminded of you when characters were going through life with their burning desire and their persistent, sometimes even rather strange, love. It's one thing to live in love, feeling the anxiety, pain, excitement, tingling of skin at a touch, quite another that each love ended in misery, or not even having an end, just disappeared into a thin air, like nothing happened. How sad. I feel love is a thing God invented to tease human, that gives you so much hope, makes you feel so full and fulfilled, will fade, inevitably, and will change, inevitably. The best one can wish is to turn it into a family-ish relation, and that's just, sad. What happened to desire? to sensitivity? to yearning of seeing someone, of being with someone, of be close to someone, of being known and understood by someone, being thought of by someone, being reminded by someone when the weather is cold, or hot, or rain, or shine, or anything, just to be reminded, that the someone, is there? I don't know why people can get over these moments so quickly (or so easily). I really don't get it. These are the moments in life that made life worth living, it gives you a memory to look back, to feel yourself deep inside that you are still sensitive to a feeling, even it is just sad, that you are alive. Moving on is indeed a wicked word. It is not by anyone's choice. It's a choice by time, and time goes on without concerning a bit of who you are, what you do, whom you love. So, 2018, like any other year, is nothing but an earmark of time, ruthlessly passing by, announcing its existence, trashing everything on its path, indifferent, cold-hearted, sensible. But human, if deserves that name, has feelings, and should cherish that, because that is all we have left. Like me thinking of you at this hour, that you probably will never know, nor will you care perhaphs. But that's all I have, all I have to stare at the face of time, at the passing of this coldness, so not to be turned into a being that myself will hate. You, keep me, sane. I miss you. Go play in the snow. You will like it. You always do, and that's how I remembered about you, and wish you remember something about me, too.

I start to have a mixed feeling of Shanghai, from love, to dislike, to annoyed, to now feeling, maybe, I could live here, someday. It is, tolerable, in a sense that, it is so massive and dynamic, and there is gotta be a corner for me, and a person for me, just that I need keep an open mind to it. What made me think this way isn't something of Shanghai, but I was thinking to live in Seoul . But then, it is just another mega metropolitan, another million people that I do not know, and I had impression of a happy tourist, and a hope of an opportunist just like a kid wondering into a new candy shop, a new theme park — everything is new, everything is exciting, everything seems possible ← even when I am typing this, the underline assumption is that, everything good is possible! I wasn't thinking at all that by using the word \"everything\", well, by definition, it includes both good and bad, doesn't it? How biased human is! How self-centered one naturally is! and how optimistic one is without a reason! I think this is indeed human nature, at least it says a lot about myself than anything else I say and do. I like watching people, like watching them walk in Starbucks in the morning, on their way to work or just to hang out. Time is indeed a luxury that many have, but few cherish. Many fancy office ladies came in for their morning drink, I don't know whether their body is used to a coffee in the morning, or it is only a psychological need, be it an accessory to her dress of the day, or her feeling of herself, or a step in her daily routine. Any, and all, I suppose. Doesn't matter. Everyone is going through 24 hours, somehow, someway, no more, and no less. I was thinking, what makes being young, so desirable, so naturally beautiful? Is it an endless possibility? energy? fine skin? flush hair? beautiful boyfriend/girlfriend? ... Actually, I feel none of the above. If there is one word, I think it is care free . This word has many times popped to my head recently, care free. Yes, I think it is exactly what American were giving the world of being cool, being, American → care free. This is what nobles and old moneys feel superior to others, not because they have many rules to observe, which they do and they are baked in their body and mind. Yet, it's the gesture of being care free, the atmosphere of a care free mind, like the Western cowboys, like a dare devil who adventure, that is charming, is mysterious, is interesting. Time, is universal to everyone. Care free, is hardly available, to anyone. The burden of middle age is exactly the opposite to being care free, and that's why it feels sooooo, tiresome, so depressing, so little with hope and excitement, and you need to amass courage to battle, to counter, to stay afloat. Kids are wonderful, because they are genuinely care free ← honestly, they don't care. Adults, if being care free, is either terrible person who is rude, insensitive, and bogus, or is really great because s/he has a free soul. I don't know which extreme I am at. I'm flattering myself even to guess this, because I'm neither — me, like zillion others, is living in between, between care frees, yearning for it, but we can not be. This may sound like a cliche, typical middle age crisis, poor guy. But there are many other forms, how about being care free and still not cool? being not care free and not responsible at the same time? I am trying hard to keep a free mind, to keep that part care free, yet I need to fulfill responsibilities of family, as I have promised to Lei, and it is part of me, like integrity — I will do what is right, whether anyone watches or not. But indeed, I have witnessed many, who lost touch w/ themselves, who walk around without being responsible, without feeling guilty about it, and making care free a gesture, not a nature, and that's really, annoying, because what they display is the exact opposite of being care free — they care so much of what others say, and they lost themselves in others' eyes. So, what makes a city? what makes a good city? I wonder. City is a mass of people. I think it's the people, the people that makes a city charming. And a city full of care free people, will be the wild wild west... No. Care free is not a label you can tell. It's a feeling you can sense, like chatting with a stranger, with a friend, you can tell, what type of person s/he is...like this guy sitting on this table, across to him is, what, his mom? his lover? I don't know.. but he is really annoying, really really rude, and he display a gesture of, terrible personality, yet he might think he is cool. Well, so if you encounter, in a random way, more of care free people in your way, than usual, I would say, that is a city, that is a good city. By this standard, I have to say, Shanghai, is far from it — there is one person this mega city I care to know, care to think, and feel pleasant with. She is care free, and I wish her that way, forever, and ever. Please, 美丽的人, be care free.","tags":"thoughts","url":"https://fengxia41103.github.io/myblog/city.html"},{"title":"Mobs","text":"The news of Ofo is really a good one.

I have to again repeat the discussion I had with family and friends 2 years ago, when Ofo and its cousins were the darling of the media, and everyone was essentially saying that if you don't understand and not yet be part of this wave of sharing economy , you are out, old, obsolete. I questioned many why they think this was a good thing, and honestly no one was able to explain to me in their own voice. The only message I got were either quotes quotes that were the same all over from one to another, making me wonder whether they were literally copying each other!?, and that it was good because it was convenient, for someone — but then, the funny thing is, no one can well define this \"someone\"!? who are they? how many are they? why is it convenient for them? why this convenience didn't work for others? and if it is that good, then something terribly bad must also be there, what is it? I mean, even in its simpliest term, if one group of people benefit so much from this while others were left out, there is a social implication, which, if is the negative side of this wave, is itself deserving study and question. But the sad reality was, no one, literally no one, voiced a different opinion! This, is the true tragedy of this fiasco. I will repeat here, if you don't hear a different opinion on something, then it is terribly wrong! stay away from it! I don't know how people will feel when they flip back to those talk shows when the CEOs of these companies were invited to talk about their GRAND idea, and their dreams , and their success — I truly believe they had a good capability, ambition, and the least, a willingness to dream big, and was able to pull it off, even for five minutes, of his/her glory — this is better than, me. Not only I admit this, but I envy this, and totally think they were successful people, in that regard. What disappointed me was that while they were standing at the height of where they were, they had a scope and opportunity to view and judge with much more inside information than I could, yet they did not show the capability, or even the willingness, to review, to challenge the exact same idea that had brought them this glory, thus was absorbed by it and taken in by its own halo, and eventually were taken by its collapse. Too many parallel can be drawn between these stories — what about Kung Fu Panda , that Shifu's pet student turned out to be a monster, because Shifu was blinded by his love to his prodigy? Too many such stories! Yet, human, yes, human, don't learn. Then, on the flip side, mobs. If these proud entrepreneurs can have one thing to take away, they should now see the motion of the mobs — they were blindly led to believe in your story, and when it collapses, it will be naive to ask them to be rational so they don't just come to your door, with their anger ( and they felt extremely justified, and logically so, just as they felt extremely convinced by your shaky story at the beginning, too ), to smash your windows, trashes your offices, insults yourself and whoever on their way, and demanding for justice, when themselves were violating the exact word, justice, with what they were doing ! This is the power of the mobs. The underline assumption is literally this — we were never wrong . When I believed in you, I was led to believe. I was innocent, defendless, and pure minded. I benefited, but you benefit more. Didn't you walk away w/ millions, billions, while I only got a deserved convenience (of riding a free bike)? Didn't I made you the billionaire? Everything you had was because of, me, me me! Thus, when I am now angry (because I felt I was cheated), I am simply taking away what I had given you, the piece that was belong to me, and (who knows, maybe can walk away w/ something more — what an opportunist animal mobs really are!) — but again, let me make sure, that I'm the victim, I have always been innocent, and I have never been wrong. How ugly! How ridiculous this logic really is! Mobs. In this sense, entrepreneurs do deserve a big paycheck, because they are playing w/ fire. They are 火中取栗, and they can be burned, big time. I recall seeing the facebook congress hearing . You know, I like this guy — he has a lot of reflection on his success, on his business, and on how his darling is changing human life. This, is what I would call the responsibility of an entrepreneur — it's not only the responsibility to build a good, healthy environment for his/her employee because there are many families in the background whose lives are now depending on his actions, but more importantly, a responsibility to reflect, to review, to ask a loads of questions, of why his has been successful, and how it can go wrong, and what price someone is paying for his/her benefit !?? We all know the principle that there is no free lunch. Exactly. There isn't. When you are benefiting from one seemingly such a wonderful thing, be it an APP, or the quality of life by industrialization, urbanization, machine age, information wave.... the terms don't matter, let's just use the cliche name, progress ... then, what are we giving up for it? Few can answer this question, even fewer care to ask. Same for myself. When I came to America, I knew my life would be a better one than staying behind (at that time of the century). The family knew we gave up a safety net of caring for parents when they need us, and I experienced the pain of long distance love over and over. If these are the price to pay, then it is not a clear cut for anyone, for myself in particular, whether the price equals the gain — like anyone else, we want to have the gains, but not the pains. Sadly, it never work that way, for anyone . Sign of mobs are, that they are easily convinced to judge one good and the other bad, and they don't question enough . If there is one sign we should look for, to foster, to hope, so that the aggregation of mobs(= society) is a becoming better, is that there are many many many many different voices who argue, who fight, who disagree, who challenge, who is not convinced, who always feel the others' decision is, questionable..... that, will be a good sign, that the people are now, smarter, and safer, to deal with. The common mistake to make, is that you like to fool foolish people, and feel awesome that your tricks work out so well... that is only when, the fools haven't turned on you. Fools, are, fools. If they can love you foolishly, they will leave you, in a foolish way, too. Engaging them, as partner or as a opponent, is making a fool of yourself.","tags":"thoughts","url":"https://fengxia41103.github.io/myblog/mobs.html"},{"title":"Human intelligence","text":"What in incredible paper ! This says so much computer and artificial intelligence than any of the popular talks. Every process of thought or action is made up of sub-processes. Let us consider such examples as making a pencil stroke, writing a letter of the alphabet, or making a plan. Quite a few discrete muscle movements are organized into the making of a pencil stroke; similarly, making particular pencil strokes and making a plan for a letter are complex processes in themselves that become sub-processes to the over-all writing of an alphabetic character. 2a8 Although every sub-process is a process in its own right, in that it consists of further sub-processes, there seems to be no point here in looking for the ultimate bottom of the process-hierarchical structure. There seems to be no way of telling whether or not the apparent bottoms (processes that cannot be further subdivided) exist in the physical world or in the limitations of human understanding. 2a9 In any case, it is not necessary to begin from the bottom in discussing particular process hierarchies. No person uses a process that is completely unique every time he tackles something new. Instead, he begins from a group of basic sensory-mental-motor process capabilities, and adds to these certain of the process capabilities of his artifacts. There are only a finite number of such basic human and artifact capabilities from which to draw. Furthermore, even quite different higher order processes may have in common relatively high-order sub-processes.\" I have had a few conversations w/ people who are not computer workers, for example, the girl who is taking care of my Dad. I have always found it difficult to demonstrate the value of computer, and at the same time annoyed by elites who brag about the future without understanding or even giving much thoughts to the complexity of their empty promise, and the implication, especially social ones, that a new way of doing things can bring . I will refine this further that there are too much attention given to the positive side of a change, which is exciting, both financially and socially, and too little to view it from a structure that, for example, presented in this paper, that guides to understand in which area/domain this change belongs to, how and why it can an impact, who is a first-degree neighbour thus be affected, and in what way. Structure, framework. I have always been advocating that in order to approach an issue, however complex (or simplistic) it is, to have a framework in place (and it can be completely subjective and incorrect) is better than none. Framework is essentially of personal view of the issue. It is not an arbitrary mark you throw on the wall and call it a structure. Rather, it is a fruit of deep thinking based on that person's experience, intelligence, and view of the world even. It is actually a summary of the all the information presented at the time and were understood by this person, and is thus an aggregation of information in shape of a design. If you think about it, everyone is an architect — we all operate this way (just like this paper is presenting), that we use our sensory system to collect information, which by nature will only be a subset of ALL, and then even a smaller portion of these collected info will be comprehensive to us, and translated into a place in an overall hiearchy, which formulates a reason that explains the info ← this is the info process, and potentially triggers a motivation that leads to action. Therefore, it is only natural that one has a framework, even implicitly, because one must have one to operate. Yet, the ability to recognize your own framework, and be able or willing to present it, is the difference. This probably can be argued as how much one understands oneself. Self-reflection brings not only a peace of mind, but a depressing view of oneself — how limited one is! how un-intelligent one is! But intelligence don't change unless one sees where it is (otherwise, one doesn't even have a reference to compare to, thus will know no improvement nor degradation). Thus, to define and present one's view, is a bold move, which shows in affirmative statements. But this is different from those emotion driven entrepreneurs, who lack the ability to think, but have too much ability to fool. If we then ask ourselves where that intelligence is embodied, we are forced to concede that it is elusively distributed throughout a hierarchy of functional processes—a hierarchy whose foundation extends down into natural processes below the depth of our comprehension. If there is any one thing upon which this 'intelligence depends' it would seem to be organization . If it were so very easy to look things up, how would our vocabulary develop, how would our habits of exploring the intellectual domains of others shift, how might the sophistication of practical organization mature (if each person can so quickly and easily look up applicable rules), how would our education system change to take advantage of this new external symbol-manipulation capability of students and teachers (and administrators)?

I think I know why → first of all, you don't have the daily chore to deal with, no daily routine, no daily worries, no family, no kids, no work. Second, in a new place, it always spells opportunity, unknown, as if everything is now possible → new encounter, new face, new soul mate just around the corner. People don't know you, you don't know them. Somehow, they all look, nice, kind, smiling at you. Especially when you are in a new country, new language feels so exotic, you don't know what they are saying, but they all sound really, cute, don't they! Then, there is, people watching. How fascinating! The thing I like to do the most on a trip is, people watching. Just like now, sitting by a bay this beautiful window by a sidewalk in Seoul, snowing a bit this morning that streets are covered by a layer of snow dusts, then, watching office people walking by to their destination, all dressed up, all look serious, all still in their daily route ← somehow, you feel, superior, that you are looking at them as if God is looking at our earthings, how much pity he has for us then? The other day while walking pointlessly in Seoul, I ran into this nice 3-story Starbucks sitting in the middle of a triangle square. Went up the 3rd floor for a coffee break, perfect location to watch people in and out the fancy glass buildings surrounding all around. What do they do? what is their life like? do they have a love? and are they happy? are they married? or about to get married? are they dating? or in the middle of divorce? ..... oh, this massive loaf of cinnamon bread I ordered this morning!!!... too much food!!... even though it is really really good!!!... you know, life can't be better than this — sitting by a warm AC, next to a big winder, no one else but a low hum of air conditioner, flashing xmas tree and light, holiday is in the air, cold outside, a BIG mug of hot coffee, no agenda, no plan, just to kill time, to feel life, as it can be — life, is indeed, a beautiful thing. I had moments when I felt life was hopeless, not worth living anymore. Then, as of this moment, I think I would regret if I am about to die. There is a side of life that is vain, ugly, disgusting, harsh, unpleasant. Then, there is this side, peaceful, quiet, everything falls into its place, no rush, you can slow down, you can sit here in the morning, typing things on your mind, thinking about the person you want to think of, how far apart you have grown, where she is, what she is doing, how well she is today, does she also have a moment like this today, a cup of coffee for breakfast, and how much you wished she would be here, sitting across this table, having a conversation, even to talk about the daily headache you two have to solve today, it's ok, just be here, be here. How I wish you were, here! This is such an unexpected trip. Without connecting w/ Seokhwan for years, all of sudden he popped up in the map, and I decided when and then that I'm coming to see him, to see his city, his country, and to give myself a break. I don't know what to expect, and honestly, I don't really care. Just go somewhere, and have an alone time, is good. But what a wonderful place this is!!! I constantly think of the word, 苦寒之地, which must have been in the old days. But then, I have to say, their king back then picked a GREAT spot to set up this city, and the city has become really a nice looking place. So are their people, good looking — boys, girls, men, women, they all walk in style, though not yet as exquisite as the Japanese, but quite close. Girls all have perfect makeups on (well I guess they are perfect, cause I couldn't tell the difference otherwise), and have really beautiful hair . They are not all stars, but they take good care of themselves, and that matters. Girls, women, really, should be just responsible to be beautiful, to make this society look nice, to make human life feel, nice. Let men do all the hard work, but enjoy a scene of beautiful sight, wherever you turn, you feel the sense of beauty, the sense of what life can produce, can make, can give. Wouldn't that be a rare gift already! I know there will be feminists who say that women are more than their body, their look, but also they have brains. Totally agree, but they underestimate how hard it is to become elegant, to act elegant, to be a perpetual beauty, not just when you are young and beautiful by nature, but be that way when you grow, when you age, when you mature ← honestly, I think it takes not only hard work, but wisdom → Excel, Powerpoint, MBA, any of these, you can learn from book and school, but being an elegant person in life, to have the inner touch that reflects to the outside world, to warm up the person near you, to lift hearts that are down, that, takes talents, takes courage, takes a wonderful mind, to achieve that. Noah really liked the movie Wonder . It was an ok story, too easy for me to predict its line and its ending. Yet, the climax when he was awarded his school's yearly achievement, was nice, when the principal said \"whose strength carries up the most hearts by the attraction of his own\". Yes, if only she knows, if only I could keep telling her this — you have a heart of gold, you have such a kindness and inner beauty. Not only you are pretty, but you have brought warmth to everyone around you, that is, wonder, that is why I miss you so much, and I care about you so much. I wish the coldness of this world will never get to you, will never let you down. I wished that I would be there to shield you from all the bad things that can come your way, but I'm weak and old, and I wouldn't be able to accompany you long before you would have to face these yourself. For that, I think the best is to let you go, so you can find someone near your age, so that he could be there for you, to grow old with you, to protect you the longest possible time. I don't know whether you understand this. I think someday you will, if you happen to read this, somehow. As smart as you are, I know you would. So my dear sunshine, my 遥远的美丽的人, at this 苦寒之地, I am missing you. How much you would have loved this snow! I can see your face brighten up, reaching out to hold a snow flake, as if you were a kid again. Yes, so this is a perfect day for this trip, snow, snow,, millions of them coming down, remind me Boston, a place I miss, and you, a person I miss. 早安. PS. Just realized, this coffee shop is called I'm Home . Life indeed has a strange plan for me.","tags":"thoughts","url":"https://fengxia41103.github.io/myblog/people%20watching.html"},{"title":"A love story","text":"It is quite an unexpected book.... wow, while looking up its book name, it turned out that it is actually called A Romance in Tibet , wow! I was making up this blog's name without knowing the books is called a romance... what a coincidence! But indeed, this is a romance, and quite a sad book. When the airbnb host recommended it to me, I was like, ok, sure I'll read it, but well, maybe. The first few pages were actually quite not getting it. But that's how it turned out, that getting up 3 in the morning due to jetlag, I got nothing else to read but this book, and what a sad story it turned out. You know, these days somehow I do feel there is something like a fate, like an invisible hand that is guiding my readings. I came up with these random books here and there, and for some reason their contents will converge, will echo during the days I was living, and made me wonder whether they were all put in my path by someone so I would have read them in that order one by one, and gradually formulate my thoughts so I think the way I think, and behave the way I do. Is that so? Or, maybe it's the other way around, that the way I think and look at this world make them interest to me, but not on other kinds? I don't know. While reading it, I couldn't help to think of the book written by Siqi's grandfather, also a narrative of his days in Tibet, some sixty years later than this. Not that there were much in common, but it made me to think of her, again. I wish there were time I could see her again, and I wonder how her hometown is like — is it also lying near these places in the book? and how that would have shaped her ways, her views? I wish to know, but I guess I will never have the chance to know anymore. This, makes me sad. I thought of regrets in life, a lot, these days. Not that I have many of them to brag and to lament. Yesterday while walking in the rain and with all the neon lights reflected off a watery street, I suddenly had a feeling that life is so hard, so hopeless, so not fun without her, that death is indeed a relief, for me. I know it's the depression talk. My life is actually not bad, comparing to anyone's, and I'm not bad, comparing to anyone's. As a matter of fact, I should say that my life is quite comfortable, nice, healthy, and so on... yet, all these mean little to me, when my heart is empty, lacking a voice inside to speak to, a person to think of, a love to give and to receive. So that's the magic of romance. Watching people walking in this massive metropolitan, I can't help asking how they go about their life, if they also don't have a luxury of romance? Do they care, or don't they? and how can they not to, by their own choice, or just by nature of theirs? I want to know. I want to know how they can reason with themselves so their life can go on, so that maybe I can check myself from falling? But deep inside I also know, that even if they bother to describe theirs to me, I would not take it in ← I would have then argued that theirs is just, theirs, and that has no reference to mine, besides, mine will turn out to be quite superior to, most of them, for sure. How ironic! Now I sound like my mom, who is never satisfied w/ what she has, and how much I have despised that!....I don't know. I'm just getting old, I guess, so I am approaching, like a proximity curve, to my parent's way, infinitely approximating, but will never touch. But then, there is romance, that always touches my soul, however remote it had been, is always beautiful, makes me sad, makes me wonder. Two souls connect, endure, and be apart — death is not the end, if it breaks a love, because that love becomes, eternal.","tags":"thoughts","url":"https://fengxia41103.github.io/myblog/a%20love%20story.html"},{"title":"Fate","text":"Another raining winter day. Walking out from airbnb, ran into an old man carrying a garbage bag, a rain coat with a big cut open on the back. What caught my attention was his black sneakers — washed clean by the rain, but felt soaking wet. He was walking with is right arm swaying in a strange way while his left hand carrying that bag. Walking by him, I put umbrella over him, \"您好, 我给您打点儿伞吧\" \"不 用不用\" so he answered. But I put umbrella over him and he didn't resist. \"我听您口音也是这边儿的人那\" \"我大学毕业就留在这儿了....\" didn't catch the rest of his words, then he went across to the other side of the residence area, I guess it's his job then to keep the area clean. I watched him went across, but feeling really sad. So he graduated from college. By looking at him, he would be about the same as my Dad, slightly younger maybe, but in that generation. And you know, college graduates in those days were, rare ! Not sure what he said is actually true, but then, what's the motivation for him to tell me otherwise. It doesn't matter. Watching him, I'm just wondering how one's fate can play out, for better, and for worse. What is the hand God is dealing me with? I don't know. These days I'm pretty bothered by losing hair on the back, not much, but still, makes me upset and uncomfortable. Maybe it has always been there, but well, it's catching on my mind these days, and I don't really like it. I think what really bothers me is the irreversible sign of aging. There are plenty young people walking around in this city, looking good, healthy, energetic... and here I am, stepping into mid age, and soon will be categorized as being old, and no one would bother to look at and to pay attention anymore... and that, is just sad. Sometimes I wonder, is this really bad? I mean, the perfect combination will be having the young age, and the experience of what I have today, and probably also the assets, like the Brookline condo, and the type of confidence at work, that I have today... if only we could have them all! But well, no one's life is, perfect, though many look great, by others' standard, or imagination. Up to this age I think it is safe to say that you will be willing to swap your life with no one's — everyone has a mess in life that s/he is having a headache to deal with, just that you don't know, until you are close enough with that person, and his/hers problem becomes, yours, like caring for aging parents, like caring for young kids, like education, like career, or health, or old boyfriend girlfriend... you just dont' know, until you have to deal with. It's hard. I wonder whether this old man has ever wondered that his fate will land him at this spot, cleaning up this area in a winter rain... when I went to the Asian Art Museum at San Fransico, the exhibit of young immigrants and their parents a few generations back, all the young men, young women, were sooooo good looking, so beatufiul! So each person, when s/he was young, was at that age, were just, beautiful.. and this man, when he was at his college, how proud he would have been, how much hope he would have had, how wonderful his future life would have been looked like to him. So, what is fate? an ever unknown path that takes you somewhere, somewhere you will only be, at the end, and looking back, and with regret and sorrow, and with joy and agony, with tears that long have been shed, with person long have been lost, with a true love one must have had.. how sad how sad! Is this because of aging, that I'm feeling so permisistic about life? I guess so, it must be. But then, when looking back in another 20 some years (and how long that actually is, 20 some years!!! That's like, a long time!! Yet, as if being discounted from life, from 45 to 70 becomes, feels, is regarded, as an instance, the same bucket of so called, old, how unfair!), I would then wish that I could only come back to this age, at 45, sitting here, should be full of hope, full of life, full of possibilities, full of love. What will be it be? My fate?","tags":"thoughts","url":"https://fengxia41103.github.io/myblog/fate.html"},{"title":"Memory","text":"Walking on the road this morning. Chilly early winter day. Rained for the last two days (or really just on and off of yesterday), and temperature has dropped to the point that I feel the winter smell. What makes you sad? and makes you wonder? what makes you to have thoughts? to feel like writing something? to miss someone? to talk to, if, anyone? to look at the passing bys, taking interest of what they, where they are going, or what their life is like? I don't know. This is indeed a strange city. Maybe taking a walk in the morning does give you more to think about, to feel about, and to have something to talk about. Sitting here at Starbucks early morning, while everybody rushes in and out to get their dose, and xmas song in the background, should I feel tied to home, where they are looking forward to the upcoming holiday? But I can't feel that at all. This empty table, like this empty space, is only giving a replay of the mornings we were sitting together, also at Starbucks, sometimes chatting, sometimes just sitting there. Not much to say, but much to save. So that is memory. What a terrible thing it is! Can a person be called a person if s/he does not have memory anymore? Dad is like that. He has lost a lot of things. You can still say that he has memory, some arbitrary, arcane ones that even hard for me to understand and to follow. Yet, the type of memory that lingers in my mind, to remind me of you, is the best of me, is the worst of my day. Why there are so many shadows that will not go away? Even this isn't the one we spent time at, it's the, I don't know, not even the smell, cause this shop doesn't have any coffee smell at all. So what is it? The lighting? the hour of the day? the empty chair across to mine? or maybe, it's nothing of these, but only, because, you still occupy a spot in my heart, in my mind, front row, center, the only audience I care to please, care to look at, care to feel. And here I am, a one man show, staged in what they call life. It has way passed its prime, but for what it is still left, I am here, playing the play, just for you.

Yet, I can't shake the feeling that you are somewhere, somewhere really close, somewhere I'm scared to look at, to look for. Are you here? You must be. The rain, the endless winter drizzle, damp, humid, chilly, not yet cold, and wind picks up, sometimes it makes you shiver, sometimes it makes it feel like a early spring breeze. I watched Lost In Translation again last night. Jet lagged, awake 11 at night, so I listened to it, and did some work. I felt really sad when the guy said, \"but I dont want to leave\".. \"then don't, we will start a Jazz band\".... it's sad, isn't it? How can I put it? I don't want to leave. Yet, I can't be an anchor for you anymore to make your life standing still. I'm not good enough for the glamour and perfection of you, as much as I would like to convince myself that I could take care of you till I die, I will, but I can't make you go through this, the life that I'm being through ← it's not fun, it's a matter of fact, that I have to take care, have to deal with, have to figure out. But you, you have full life ahead of you. You should be trouble free, worry free, burden free, just fly, fly w/ all you want, fly high, fly w/o being dragged down. I want you to have this life, not a gift of any kind, but what you deserve, and what you should have. That's a young life I can't give you. Though with endless 不舍, I have to let you go on. But you are everywhere. Watched those Japanese movies on the flight, one after another, I found you in it — they all looked like you. I don't know why. Maybe it's just because they, as being actresses in a movie, are all good looking, and that is certainly you. But there is more to it. I can't describe, it's just that everywhere I turn, I find you, a trace of you, somewhere, on somebody. It's just there, amazingly, there. What a person you are! and How much I am missing you! Every step I take, every turn I make, everything incidence that triggers me a thought, it's always you, who is there, on my mind, that I speak to, and wished you were here, next to me, belong to me. How wonderful the days you have given me! I will never forget, till the day I die. If marriage will ruin a relationship, then don't, don't marry, cause love is such a beautiful thing, that it deserves a chance to live, to last longer, to be forever, to be always sweet, and never fade.

During lunch the kids at his table played truth or dare. Noah dared, a girl, to rape ..... geee.. I was totally speechless and didn't even understand where he could have picked up that concept. Teacher said she felt this is a topic she should leave to parents to talk him about... so he and I had a talk on the way to Kumon. The good things is that he admitted he said so, not like before that he would try to get out of it by denying or finding other excuses like \"but the other kid started it\". So where did he get that idea? He said I told him that!!.. what!? How? where? .. \"you remember the movie we watched yesterday?\" \"which movie!?\" \"The Japanese samurai movie.\" \"Samurai movie?.... oh, you mean, the one in which that guy killed someone for a girl, and he then attacked that girl?....\" \"yes\" Oh mine mine.... so he is referring to this movie — Satan's Sword: The Dragon God (1960)- Raizō Ichikawa , in which a young Samurai was traveling, and met a girl who fell in love with him. She had a pursuer who was rather a psycho. He hired a rouge who owned a gun to ambush this samurai on his way, and abducted her to a hideout. The rouge, however, wanted to attacked the girl. By being still in love with her, well, that was the intention to begin with, right, so he got in a fight with this rouge, and ended up killing. The girl tried to run away when they were fighting, but failed to escape. He then sexually assaulted her, and that's when I presumably told Noah about \"rape\".. actually I asked him what this word means, and he said it means \"sexually assault\". \"Well, then, is it good or bad?\" \"Bad.\" \"Correct, any assault is bad, sexually assault is especially bad.\" But what got me thinking, is that out of the entire movie of so many good things one can learn — bravery, loyalty, love, courage, nobility, aesthetic, curiosity of what a daily life was like back in 12th century Japan... out of all these, one thing he learned, and came to him mind, was this, \"rape\"!... how could this be!!!? why!? You know. See, everyone grows up eventually, everyone learns about concept of these words, eventually. There is no denial that somehow one figures it out, same as sexual education, same probably for anything else, life in general, that you will learn the truth of life, truth of reality, and how pleasant and unpleasant it actually is, and what is important, and what is just flashy and superficial. Therefore, one needs to know about these bad words, and it is unrealistic to expect one knows how to use it properly on day 1 as soon as one learned about it, isn't it? Of course I'm not encourage such behavior at all. As a matter of fact, I'm totally appalled by a phone call like this. But it is part of a growing pain I'm afraid, for both me and Noah. This always makes me wonder why human mind, as a clean sheet as a kid's, will be attracted/impressed more by these, in our eyes, bad things, than those, again in our eyes, the good things!? Is it by nature that taboo is more attractive and exciting, thus leaving a stronger impression in memory, thus making it more likely to pop up in this type of events when he was easily carried away? What is it that makes these \"fun\", for him, but totally not acceptable by our social standard by any dimension? I don't know. I think I'm going down the path of generalization myself now, and am using the word \"any\" a lot in this discussion, which, by my own statement last weekend, can not be true, should not be true, and is just bogus, because any must speak for a generalization which can not stand a test in logic ← what do you mean by any!? you only need one single counter example to defeat such generalization. But then, there is these things, such as sexual assault, which is bad bad bad, in any case, by any standard, and at any time... so there I have it, an ANY-case, that, is always bad. So you can try to fish out a counter example for the sake of argument. But I think once it comes to a judgment, because it is entirely and solely subjective, it becomes irrelevant whether it is a generalization → I think it is wrong, therefore it is wrong. But the reverse is true, also → I think it is right, therefore it is right. What this means? That there isn't such a thing as being objective? that there isn't a thing called truth? or fact? Even if they exist, what role do they play in your judgment/conclusion? Isn't it still your subjective decision to take them or leave them? to believe them or disregard them? If so, what's the point anymore to dig up truth? and isn't the version of truth also a product of the writer's or the investigator's conclusion, thus is also subjective!? This can't be good. But I don't see a way out of this strange loop. A sunny day today. Life is indeed, strange.","tags":"thoughts","url":"https://fengxia41103.github.io/myblog/bad%20words.html"},{"title":"Domain knowledge","text":"What is a domain knowledge? Domain knowledge implies a knowing of a specific area of knowledge, like plumber knows plumbing. It's quite easy to picture that everyone, or should say every profession, is a its own domain, thus has its own knowledge, which in true, in the same sense that goes by a Chinese saying, 隔行如隔山. However, if we take it broadly, I would argue everything, every person, has a domain knowledge of a sort that is unique only to that person. Watching those \"10 coolest hand-made toys\" youtube videos make you wonder how creative this person is, how much time s/he has at hand, and deep down you also know that your brain is not up that, even given you as much time — you two are simply, different. Thus, wouldn't it be fair to say that his/her domain knowledge is different from yours then!? I think so. No two people are alike, which not only means that no two people look identically, but also emphasizes their knowledge repository, the structure of how they think, how they perceive, how they process information and derive conclusion, and how they reason → in short, their domains are just different, thus their domain knowledge will be different. But \"different\" is itself a broad concept. It's another always-true statement that people are just different ← the counter argument will be to find a black swan so to prove this statement is wrong. But this type of always-true statement is not refutable. It has positioned the question in such a way that it is simply futile to search for a counter example. Rather, I would challenge the original argument and its definition in order to narrow down the scope of it. Once it becomes more concrete (\"being different\" is quite an abstract concept, but narrowing it down to \"how are they different? they have different colors.\" Well, that is refutable now, if we further define what is color, and so on...), it becomes actioinable ← we can either prove it right, or wrong. The reason I am talking about domain knowledge, is that at work I have constantly run into ideas and projects, my own moonlight POCs included, that when presenting to another audience to so called discussions , there are always two tyes of reactions — some find it exciting and like it , and some put out a few concerns and counter example, not to plainly shoot down the idea, but to bring in caution and further discussions → these are all good point. But my question is — how do you distinguish yourself from an existing competitor!? We recognize a \"problem\", and think we have a good idea to \"fix it\". We even wrote some code to POC its feasibility and are hoping to show its value. But the hard question is always, why you!? why yours!? I used to draw this discussion eventually to domain knowledge, that ours is, should be, better, because we have a better domain knowledge, than competitors'. And if there is a work lagging, I would think that they have not done their homework right to discover, consolidate, and benefit from their domain knowledge. This sounds quite alright. But with the arguments I have presented at the beginning of this article, wouldn't it now sound fishy that using this ambiguous term is nothing but to make myself sound smart which, by being an always-true statement, giving others no chance to prove me wrong!? This is terrible. But I don't want to yet give up its use. Here is why. Take this hardware management tool for example. On one hand there are opensource projects, free of charge; on the other company develops a product. How to make the company one stand out then!? I mean, we will lose to opensource simply by the sheer number of developers, don't you think!? And in nowadays' tech stack, toolsets are increasingly converging, meaning that if I were a front-end developer and am asked to draw a line graph, there are only a few libraries come to mind — they all look alike, regardless how well I can tweak them. And with that we also know that value is not at the line graph even, it is what that graph can tell me, and what I can do with that info, really matters. So how to achieve these two!? Domain knowledge. I firmly believe this is your only chance to stand out, and should be the only criteria — fundamentally it is information asymmetry . I have already said before that power lies in this, so that's where the power to win over competition lies. There is no other way. Vendor doesn't even need to intentionally build that barrier by using something like a trade secret or patent, which lead to another lengthy debate of moral sense of knowledge. Let's keep an open book. I always argue that when was the last time you were willing to look at someone's code, and could actually understand what it was saying!? or, take any Physics text book, the laws are written down, figured out! Yet, did you ever read them? and fewer understands them even! Therefore, domain knowledge is not secret, but a theory or practice that is hard to replicate because of its complexity, not of its secrecy. Vendor is naturally positioned in the front row of this race, because they created that product at the first place — naturally, he knows more of it than anyone else ← here, I want to emphasize again that competing on just sheer data point level is going to be a losing battle — collect and display the same data point, CPU, temperature, raid controller models... these are essential, but these are the starting line every racer is at. Your advantage as a vendor should display in the domain knowledge of what those numbers mean, and what we could do with them — CPU goes up 100%, is this good? bad? When upgrading firmware, wouldn't vendor's tool, however ugly it may be, still holds an edge over an opensource approach, simply because we think vendor knows better of that level of operation, and firmware is so fundamental that getting it wrong will just kill your thousand dollar equipment!? These, is what I will call domain knowledge — an edge over others not because we keep information from others. On the contrary, we just know more, know better, and are fully willing to share. But these knowledge, really we should call them experience , like a personal experience, is so hard to transfer, that it makes you, unique, thus valuable. For these data driven applications, I think we can view them in three layers: Do I have data points that others don't have? → protocol, or sheer openness. Do I know a scenario of these data points that others don't have? → support cases is a wealthy mine of real world experience. When taking an action, can I keep the system stable and healthy better than others can? I feel we have focuses too much on #1, which leads to competition of cosmetic, user experience, and at most, convenience. However, none of these will give you an edge: cosmetics: I have already said that toolsets are converging. Your line graph will not be that much different from ours. And even it's pleasing to look at, one quickly gets bored of it, and will ask the question — what does this line mean? UX: this is an endless discussion, and let's leave it to people who have passion of, humans. convenience: do you realize that this actually implies that customer knows the same as you do!? They are already doing it, but you think you have a better way. Then of course, the question is, how much better is yours? Well, this is like proving yourself worth being loved this girl, and we all know that's just pointless — she loves, or not, has nothing to do with how good a person you actually are. Instead, point #2 is a info repo vendor natually has, but simply will not be accessible by the public, and don't we all know how creative and bizarre the real world can be!? This gives you information that is exclusive, and that leads to advantage! Point #3 should come out of #2, and one failed at this, one should fail to distinguish oneself, because this is where the gold is, this is the domain knowledge . Getting to this is hard, but that's how it should be done. So this lengthy, ambiguous, argument, is what I think about domain knowledge. Confusing, isn't it!?","tags":"thoughts","url":"https://fengxia41103.github.io/myblog/domain%20knowledge.html"},{"title":"Addiction","text":"What is an addiction then!? and why is this word negative!? I think when we talk about this word, the implied message logic is that it is bad because it puts a person into an extreme condition, thus is not sustainable, thus is not healthy ← so there are quite a few assumptions: Extreme state is, bad (but is it bad because of #2 below, that it is not sustainable!? or, regardless it is sustainable or not, it is just bad being in any kind of extreme? and is there such a thing as \"extreme & good\"?). Unsustainable is no good. Well, this is actually interesting then, because then I would ask, what is the sustainable state!? Is drinking water instead of being an alcoholic more sustainable!? Is it defined as being able to live longer, thus more sustainable ? or less likely to be bored of!? This last one must not be true then, because alcoholics don't get bore of liquors, thus definition of this word, alcoholic! So, it is not whether you will be tire of doing the same thing over and over. What about being able to do that longer than others!? When you can walk longer than sprint, walking, is more sustainable than sprint. Therefore, if taking average course one can last longer than the other, this one is more sustainable. These two criteria have nothing to do with whether this addiction makes one happy. You can be addicted to an act that makes you really happy, but it is still an addiction, thus, bad. So, is being in an extreme state really bad!? I actually start to think that they are not. First of all, what is an alternative if not being extreme? Somewhere in the middle. But how to identify of this point!? Without knowing it, how do we know we are off!? and even if we do know where it is, is keeping at that balance state all the time possible!? I would argue it is not. So people are thinking of deviation — what is the degree of us deviating from this balance? But this leads to two questions: How to measure a deviation ← and this implies we know two data points, the reference (that balance point), and where we are. What is the criteria so it becomes bad? So, as long as we don't have a definition of these two, we can't battle \"not being extreme\", because we just don't know. Secondly, we associate addition to things like smoking, drugs, these things get you high, well, under the name of also making you happy . Therefore we think they are bad, because your body craves for them once you are addicted. But is getting high, bad? We know these things make your brain emmit some chemicals so you feel the experience. But other actions can trigger them just as well — sports, sex, and in stone age days, hunting, war → we know getting in a fight will get your body into a state that it feels, high, then extreme fatigue ← isn't this the same cycle that getting high experiences!? I don't know. Maybe they are different chemicals, different processes, but I think there are tremendous overlap between the two. Thirdly, if getting high makes you, happy. Don't we all be pursuing, happiness, in life, as the ultimate goal!? Then, here it is, why not!? So it is not sustainable, won't last, but then, what will? I feel there is a convolution of logic → this doesn't feel right, but I don't know what it is, 诡异的逻辑. Well well. So I don't have an answer, not even a train of thoughts, just a mess of conflicting statements. But still, as I have been telling Noah, as I have been told by my dad at Noah's age, two things don't touch — drugs, and gambling. Addiction or not, they will ruin your life, and your happiness. Addicted to love? Might be ok.","tags":"thoughts","url":"https://fengxia41103.github.io/myblog/addiction.html"},{"title":"A better world","text":"It has been a fascinating thought to me — is human the only specie who thinks about leaving a better world for their children? This perception, or statement, has been widely used in many talks, conversations, lectures, debates, and propaganda, that by doing so and so, we are to leave our children a better world. Or, often presented in the opposite way, that by not doing so and so, we are leaving them with a less world than ours, and shouldn't this give us, the current generation, the moms and dads, a strong incentive to change!? This is how NPR's discussion of climate change has presented itself. On one hand, I have been talking to Noah about becoming a vegetarian. By eating less meat (here I'm also blindly taking someone else's statement as truth ← individually by eating less meat, we could make our contribution to help the climate change catestrophe), we are doing our share to help a change. But on the other, I was thinking to myself, why leaving them with a better world is taken as an indisputable, wish!? Don't we always argue that my definition of being better is not necessarily the same as theirs? Don't all parent generation do this by imposing a superior knowledge that \"I know what is good for you\", and gets back fired when their children grow up, and the young generation simply ignores such advice or concern, and turns out to be a life, sometimes better, sometimes worse, than previous generation has predicted? Then, if we learn from the parental lesson by treating kids as more of a peer than a brain-less walking body, shouldn't we also apply the same principle in those grand topics, such as climate change, that the children generation will, either live in a world which is just different, or figure out a new way of living that cope with the new environment, or even better (or worse) that their definition of a good life becomes a different version from ours? ← what we value as being good, such as nature, specie diversity, blue sky, clean air, wouldn't it be that case that they will start to like indoor, AC-ed environment, artificial lights, virtual reality, and so on (don't these sound familiar already!?). I understand this picture sounds really disturbing. But I am not too sure that what I wish to leave them is actually good. If borrowing from personal experience of love and relationship, I would even argue that being good is not the point — being what they want is important. Hasn't there been enough cases we all know that being the good guy gets you nowhere, but giving her what she wants (if you are lucky to know, or smart enough to figure it out) is what makes her happy. Isn't that the whole point of \"leaving them a better world\" is implying that a \"better world\" will make them happy!? But how do we know!? or do we know? If I take this to an extreme, how do we know that they don't love, war!? or death!? or bullying!? Aren't we again giving them a world that conforms with our principle and preference, while depriving them an opportunity to develop organically of their own!? But this can't be right. I do think there is a consistent principle of good versus bad — clean air, good; smogs, bad. Safe environment, good; discrimination, bad.... I'm speaking from my own education and perception. I fully understand that Noah's generation will have variation of many of these what I hold as true or dear. But I still believe there are things which are bad, regardless which generation is in prime. War, for one, is bad. Human who are caught in it is miserable, outright miserable. What about ants? what's their good life, or better life? do they care their children as we do? or they care them in a different way? This is the same logic one debates about history — what we judge of history is at the point of view of ours. Rolling back to their time, do they still appear the same way!? and since going back in time is impossible, then how can we reconstruct the \"back then\" faithfully? Wouldn't there be unlimited number of factors that it is mathematically impossible to do so!? If we know about butterfly effect, then unless we roll back in time, the entire analysis of history and their lessons learned would be nothing but a subjective opinion by the author, wouldn't it!? I don't know. The more I think about human society, about what is good, what is right, the more I start to question whether there is a truth that is irrelevant from our interpretation, or everything is just a human imagination . Take the dollar for example. We all know that paper money is nothing but, a piece of paper. But then, is gold really better than this paper!? Not really. It has not so called intrinsic value either. It is just a material, a carrier, that many people agrees upon, that's all. It is always someone's dream that you will find gold everywhere on Mars or somewhere, where it was treated like dirt, but beings over there values, human waste, as their \"gold\"! This is the same theme over and over and over. When US conquered the West, native Indians couldn't care less about gold mine in Black Hill . Yet, gold is values by everyone else. So there you go, people poured in to take over the territory which were protected by law (at the time) as Indian reservation. You can call them driven by greed. I think the essence of greed, is just, imagination !! So what they fought over essentially was a thing that lived in nothing but imagination of a society (in our words, the modern society, but really, is modern == more imagination!?), while yours (in this case the local Indians) did not share the same imagination. But then, their lives were destroyed because of it. How ugly! Honestly, I totally believe that such imagination is both the core attribute of human, and the core cause of everything terrible happening to human. In this sense, I would even question whether propaganda is really such an evil!? Isn't it just another form of, imagination!? Strength is always the weakness . The more creative we become, the more we are encouraging imagination, the more wonders we will see and implement, then, the more nasty, ugly, terrible traits human will develop, will demonstrate, will endure. Is this good? bad? better? or worse?","tags":"thoughts","url":"https://fengxia41103.github.io/myblog/a%20better%20world.html"},{"title":"Early morning","text":"I'm getting used to getting up early to feed them. But I still can't get used to not thinking of you, when I'm awake, when I'm lying there in an early winter morning like this. Where are you? I don't know where you are anymore, nor hear from you of anything in your life. Sometimes I feel quite upset about this, that I'm now out of your life, maybe even for the rest of it, that I am nothing but a stranger to you, like million others in that city, in this world. Yet, you are not someone whom I only bump into on a street. The days, the moments kept coming back to me, day and night. I haven't had a nice afternoon nap like yesterday for a long time. Noah and his mom were at church. Waking up, a room filled with cozy sunshine, and zhu wawa cuddling next to me, twisting left and right, as if don't know how to show off his cuteness and his yearning for love anymore, stretching stretching, he put his soft paws over my mouth, as if to say \"don't say anything\"... it was a moment I felt genuinely happy, a life with loved one near by, no more, no less. All of sudden, I realized one thing, that happiness only exists in moments, and a moment can only be counted in a split of second, then disappears, becoming a past, becoming only a memory one could think of, but never able to keep. I miss you, my dear sunshine, wherever you are, I miss you. I miss the evening when we sat on top of 南山 watching the city lights under our feet, miss the day we went out for a day tour roaming around the city, ended up climbing this little hill and finding a temple with no other tourist but us, and you tripped on a stair, and I pretended we were shooting a movie scene, how funny that was! I remember you holding a stick in hand like a little boy with his sword marching on, remember arcades when you raced against a group of teenager boys who must have been fascinated by having someone like you to join. You are special. No matter how hard I tried to leave you, to put these moments to rest, they will not go. There is nothing I can do about. They are here, to stay. If unhappiness are simply longer, more, than those happy moments, then happiness has to be sharper, stronger, to balance, and that's what they are — these memories, these moments when I see them like a movie playing in my head, scene by scene, over and over and over, is what keep me warm, keep me sane. Darkness is all over me; you, gave me light.","tags":"thoughts","url":"https://fengxia41103.github.io/myblog/early%20morning.html"},{"title":"SPA: a cofiguration Dashboard","text":"Project SPA Dashboard demo Demo Code Project SPA Dashboard is a weekend fun. The idea came from Lenovo Open Cloud project, in which we have developed auto deployment of a complex stack on three physical servers. Services are Red Hat software deployed on a RHHI instance. Previously we have maintained a table (shown below) of URLs to these services since VM's IP and hostname are pre-determined. IBB example cheatsheet However, since we have achieved daily deployment using playbook and extra_vars as input, it is possible to generate a dashboard representing a deployment instance with these actual config values, thus eliminating manual maintenance of a static wiki page. For example, here is part of the config file of Satellite VM: vm_name : brain1-satellite <-- host name qcow_name : rhel75_qcow_satellite cloud_init_nics : - nic_name : eth0 nic_boot_protocol : static nic_ip_address : 10.240.41.1 nic_netmask : 255.255.252.0 nic_gateway : 10.240.40.1 nic_on_boot : true - nic_name : eth1 nic_boot_protocol : static nic_ip_address : 172.20.20.101 nic_netmask : 255.255.255.0 nic_gateway : 172.20.20.1 nic_on_boot : true - nic_name : eth2 nic_boot_protocol : static nic_ip_address : 172.20.30.101 nic_netmask : 255.255.255.0 nic_gateway : 172.20.30.1 nic_on_boot : true dns1 : 10.240.0.10 dns2 : 10.240.0.11 host_name : brain1-satellite boot_devices : hd os : rhel_7x64 cpu_cors : 4 memory : 20GiB storage_domain_vm : iso storage_domain_disk : vmstore disk_format : cow disk_interface : virtio_scsi disk_bootable : True nics : - name : nic1 interface : virtio profile_name : Campus network_name : Campus - name : nic2 interface : virtio profile_name : PhysicalMgmt network_name : PhysicalMgmt - name : nic3 interface : virtio profile_name : VMMgmt network_name : VMMgmt Once retrieved, displaying them is really a no brainer. Design The design of it is straightforward. Two components: config repo server : a web server serving YAML configs over HTTP. The source of YAML files are from git. Alternative, we can have github server raw file content directly, thus functioning as the web server fetch can get these YAML data. client side : is the single page application who retrieves YAML data and displays them. Code structure is reused of data visualization . Introduced js-yaml for parsing YAML, we use fetch API to retrieve YAML configs, and map them to individual section for display. The overall architecture is shown below: SPA Dashboard Design Benefits are obvious: All values are from YAML config files used by actual deployment. Therefore, it's the EXACT same source of our daily. Consistency is guaranteed. YAMLs are served by a webserver and retrieved by this application. Thus, it is a trivial step away from having a centralized \"config repo service\" for this EXACT purpose. Application has built-in capability to fetch data in format of YAML or JSON. Thus, it can speak to any REST API, eg. getting server meta from netbox, or POST a request to Tower to kickoff a → the possibility of integration is endless. Any displayed config can be turned into a input box, so we can change config and trigger redeploy or update . The frontend (this application) is ready; the function behind the scene is not there yet. But when we ever have such capability, we can demonstrate it quickly. Toolset Materialize : \"A modern responsive front-end framework based on Material Design\" by their words. REACT : core webpack : new module builder that is making lot of buzz these days. fetch : a new way to talk to API endpoints instead of jQuery AJAX .","tags":"demo","url":"https://fengxia41103.github.io/myblog/project%20spa%20dashboard%20demo.html"},{"title":"Law","text":"It is, I think, the darkest moment in history, that I have been experienced in this great country. Listening to senator hearing for the first time last Thursday, and I was both impressed by the capability to grasp the core of the issue that these senators demonstrated, and the disturbing display by this guy who is bitter, angry, aggressive, eager to please his boss, and not hesitating to express a statement in the form of a conspiracy, even linking it to \"the Clintons\", who, regardless what type of opponent they have been in the presidential race, not to mention that Mr. Clinton has been a real president elected and was doing a good job by the measure of economy. What type of person would this guy be that he is now being bestowed the super power of being a life-long employed judge sitting on the bench of a sacred institution, which I have always viewed with awe and respect, because I thought it holds all the wisdom in this world despite how hard, how difficult to determine, the problem it is assigned to make a decision (think about abortion, gay marriage, anything racial). If we say that the US government has had periods and presidents that failed to win the respect of the world, and had flunked terribly in making this country and this world a better place, this Supreme Court has always been the last line of defense that people could still trust, still have a faith that truth, objectivity, fairness, righteousness, and an idealism that runs in the core of this form of democracy, is being held, being guarded, firmly and thoroughly. They are like the priests of today's society. When all measures fail, we believe they know better, and will guide us out of trouble and chaos. But all these have been proven to be an illusion, shattered. I don't have an opinion whether he had really done the harassment back 30 some years. I'm against him not because I think he has violated the law. But as a job applicant, he has shown himself not be a proper candidate for the job. Period. Let me ask you this, when was the last time you interviewed someone, asking him/her a question, and this person just throw it back at you — do you know the answer? — or even making a comment that your question is just an attack on behalf of some organization, some ideology, some force!!!!?? Give me a break! You tell me, will you hire this person!? This is truly a running joke. I don't care how qualified s/he is, how wonderful s/he can do the job, I don't think manager will embrace an employee who has such attitude, not to mention the teammates who will be working with this person! Yes, this is another question I want to ask — why the other judges have no saying in this interview!? Aren't they the people who will be working as this elite team !? Then, shouldn't they also give a vote on whom they feel comfortable to work with!? This is totally absurd!!! If judicial branch is designed to be independent from other two branches, why in the hell is the head of the executive branch nominating this candidate!???? This is truly contradictory to what I have always believed the merit of this system. And honestly, the more I'm witness these type of fiasco unfold in front of the public's eyes, the more I recall Tom's comment before the 2016 election, that \"Trump will the worst\" possible person for the job. At the time, without having any experience with Trump, I had hoped, and sometimes even hailed, his disruptive manner to the traditional political cliches. But now, I feel he is a total disaster, totally, disastrous. He runs this country as if this is his family business, and he demonstrated a trait of a dictator, a moody one I should say, like no others I have seen (except Billismo). He might be capable, but I'm against any form of such singular, super, concentrated, unchallenged, authority! any! This is a form that leads China into a totalitarian path, leads an engineering team into low efficiency, leads an inevitable pattern of irresponsibility, because it allows one, and only one, decision making process, that is top down, single to N, and no feedback loop. Participants will throw up their hands and say, you know what, I'll just do what you say, but I won't contribute any of my minds, because it's useless, won't be considered, and even could bring fire on my own — but you see, where then will be the line between being a member of a team, and being but a slave!?? This exactly why I hate, hate the authoritarian approach of the Chinese management style, and now why I am feeling so upset of what this country is heading. This is indeed, terrible, even horrible. Kavanaugh had one thing right, the effect of this event will be felt long after this has passed us. I don't know how Supreme Court will function and be viewed since. One thing I'm sure → politics are ugly, disgraceful, and frustrating, in both camps of the Western's and the Eastern's. And, hold on for two more year. I'm sure to vote in 2020. Trump, out.","tags":"thoughts","url":"https://fengxia41103.github.io/myblog/law.html"},{"title":"Dictator, human language, concept","text":"Here is a really interesting conversation with Noah. We have been watching a documentary ( Soviet Storm: World War II — In The East. ). At his age he is absorbed to the war scenes. Then, driving from his school we were talking about how Russia fought the war, he started saying that Stalin is the head of all Russian troops, and he quoted a famous order by him that no one can retreat (I think he was talking about the Leninggrad). So I said, you know, Stalin was actually a terrible person. \"Why?\" \"Cause he is a dictator.\" \"What is a dictator?\" I actually don't know. I tried to come up with a definition, \"Dictator is someone who does not like disagreement. He only wants what he wants.\" \"Oh\" Then, we were talking about German, \"Hitler is a dictator, too.\" I said. \"No!\" \"What do you mean by no!?\" I was rather alarmed ! \"Adolf is not a dictator!\" He said it in such an affirmative tone that I was truly start to wonder what type of message/impression he has got about Adolf Hitler. \"But why you say so?\" \"Because, there is a general who was constantly disgreeing with Adolf. Constantly!\" errr..... This makes me wonder, how many of these knowledge we have taken so much for granted, never questioned much, thought we have comprehended thorough without doubt (of course, who could argue when we say Stalin and Hitler were dictators? and don't we all know what dictator is, when we see one!?). Then, come along these kids. You star to realize just how uncertain you actually are about what you think you know. Really, dictator, how to define it? and is that definition, whatever it is, questionable also? What about other words, probably good words? What are they? Why there are some traits in human we have always admired, respected, hoped to become, like integrity, honest, kindness? Or, are they also recent events, maybe after the Renaissance(?), like the idea of State, patriotism, identity of a country, or race? I have always challenged the human language that on the one hand they are necessary to describe, to communicate, thus essential to us. Yet, they are constantly in flux that new words created at the moment that fits perfect for its meaning, then it gets lost, even reversed, in the different setting, but we continue take them as if they hold one and only one interpretation. And even worse, language, any nouns, are nothing but a label, and people use and abuse these labels to achieve their goals (politics comes to mind, which is notoriously prevalent in labeling opponents as if the label itself represents an objective opinion. Yet we all know there is not objectivity in this exercise at all ← by logic, noun/label can only be a subjective opinion because naming anything, anyone, is nothing but a human mind activity — cloud is perfect fine on its own with or without a name to it, and it certainly was never consulted whether it likes the name cloud , maybe it likes the name mary better!?). So, where is the balance, if there is one at all!? We have to use a language in life, but we are caught by this invention. Now with the amass population of social media and mobile device, communication has expanded in magnitude. So we see the phenomenon of all kinds of word games, some funny, some outright ugly because they are a lie. See, even while writing this, I have inevitably used the word lie to describe a concept I am thinking. Yet, there is nothing about this word that holds a truth of any kind. Only because it has been learned by million other English speakers so we are on the same page of what it means. Martian might as well have called it truth , and confused the hell out of all earth people. Well, is it a concept in mind that drives the use of a label? Like the talk of dictator. I was trying to convey a concept of a type of person/behavior to Noah. So I guess the only solution is if one can transmit mind wave to another human being, somehow, and gets understood. No words required. But how do we verify even if this is possible? I mean, how do I know s/he gets the concept exactly as I transmitted? As an engineer I actually don't see a solution at all. Even in this scenario, we are implying that the two are both alive! The best value of literature is that thoughts/concepts can carry over time ← this makes it possible for human knowledge pool to increment. But then, there is love, when two souls are indeed in sync, in a mysterious way, that no words are necessary, but they understand each other, feel each other, ALWAYS, on the same page. So there must be hope, of some kind. I guess for now, Noah, the word \"dictator\" is just bad. It's the concept that matters, not the definition. Or, how about, music !?","tags":"thoughts","url":"https://fengxia41103.github.io/myblog/dictator.html"},{"title":"Imagination is life","text":"It has been said that what makes human superior to (or different from) other species on this planet is that human is the only one that can imagine; others operate off facts and reality. They do not possess the skill (or the brain capacity) to imagine a virtual world, something that is not there, that is maybe , that is possible. This is quite interesting, because it definitely feels so — we are often moved and motivated by a futuristic view, which may or may not pan out to be the case. Yet we get excited about it, work hard based on such projection, and gets disappointed if it doesn't realize the way we want . So is love, is life. I was thinking today while limping along → what makes of life? what makes one full of life? why getting old makes one, less lively, appearing to have less life? Is it really the beauty, the young skin, the age? These are rather, factual. There is no denial that elders don't look as good , but that is also by the eyes of the young I would think. Even when I heard other species don't imagine, I would have argued that there are two assumptions to this that can be challenged: how do you know a frog doesn't imagine? you can't impose your definition of imagination upon a frog cause s/he (or it) also imagine, but differently from yours. Therefore, using this statement to support the argument that human thus is better, is rather groundless ← this is the same when you say you are the best looking person in the world (or your mom says so) because you are using a standard so subjective (and almost absolutely unique) that no one else can match. As soon as we start to question the objectivity of it, the saying crumbles down. So aging, wrinkled skins, lost physiques, can not be used to make the case of having less life. In the eyes of the 80s, ladies in their 60s are young (then how funny that human is so obsessed of age difference when they are actually young! A love between a 20-year-old girl and a 40-year-old guy often gets a rap as if the girl is at loss and the guy is taking advantage of her). And even their definition of life has likely changed from the ones I'm thinking of ← maybe they view experience of ups and downs more valuable than a pretty face, a healthy teeth more than a flush hair. Then, what about the proximity to death? Surely the closer you are, the less life you should have. This sounds right. Yet, how to explain people who are more, lively, in their 80s than someone who is in the 20s!? Stress? Unhappiness? unfairly treated by life? bad luck?... None of this sounds right. Here is my theory. The degree of life is indeed defined by the capacity to imagine. The more of you that is still willing to imagine, and the less you are views things in its reality and be annoyed by it (or, like me these days, even upset by it), the more life you have. Kids are known to be master of imagination, and no one could deny that kids, all of them, are full of life, energy. Yet, we will also agree that they are the farthest from reality ← they take no notice of time, no etiquette of any except their instinct, no sense of order, completion, anything. When they start to grow up, they are thrown into the reality and forced to learn, to adapt, and to replace, bit by bit, their imaginative world with facts. Like the talk on NPR today, human took astrology because they thought the sky, the wind, the sun, the moon were talking to him, telling him it is time to plant, to harvest, and so on (what a self-important view!). Then, came the scientist, whose so called truth (physics) tells the complete opposite ← that you are nobody in this world, no sun god is overseeing your business, you better either plant your seed when the time is right, which physics and satellite are making it pin-point accurate, or your crop will fail. In the pre-weather-forecast version, we feel loved, we revered these mysterious forces, we feel connected, there is life in everything; in the factual world, yes we as a specie has advanced and has gained much more control than sacrificing a pig to pray for rain. Yet, we have less life . When I'm depressed, I feel the say way. When I got frustrated by some BS talks and wondered how people can be blind to such contradicting reasoning and sometimes pure lies, life itself becomes a burning hell. Then, when love strikes, when a picture of her and a life with her dangling in front of my mind, life is wonderful. So I think the argument is indeed correct — that human is defined by its capacity to imagine, not by its capacity to take facts. Old people don't have less life because they are old, but because they know more, they see more reality, and they put less weight to imagine. Not that they don't imagine. I think they do; I think we will also do. Just that when you imagine, you hear louder and louder a voice in your head, in your heart, telling you this is virtual. When we gain the capability to distinguish reality from fiction, we are becoming stronger, wiser, a better person, I believe. Then, like everything else in life, we pay a price of not believing in a tin solider friend, or love, or a rosy future. We feel, less life.","tags":"thoughts","url":"https://fengxia41103.github.io/myblog/imagination%20is%20life.html"},{"title":"How hard is it to listen?","text":"I guess it must be hard. Noah completely tipped me off again today. His glasses were bent (slightly), and I asked him what happened. He said there was nothing. Then he said yes he was hit by somebody. Then the story turned out to be that he chose to be under someone's chair during independent reading time, and the kid kicked into his face, somehow. I was totally mad! on multiple degrees! First, lie. I hate this. If you did it, admit it. Don't try to wiggle out of it, especially when you are only, what, 10!? There is no way you are going to fool me yet. And, didn't we just talk about this last week, that any lie will only lead to more lies so it rolls like a snowball until a spectacular fall. The longer you can cover it up, the messier it will be when it crashes. I know kid doesn't this yet. But this is a lesson in life, and he needs to learn it, needs to memorizes this, needs to never do this again . Second, integrity. We just went over last week! I was pissed off when finding out during a school's parent even that he had skipped A LOT of works in class (I'm talking 4 out of 5 pages are just blank!!!) He said they are optional. Fine. But even the required one is not completed! We had a long discussion after it, and it wasn't pleasant at all. I brought up the topic of integrity , which his social study went over in 3rd grade. Integrity, is to do the right thing even when no one is looking or knowing. I was using it to tell him that even without me finding out, he should have been a good student in these classes by doing his homework and listening to teachers. But, he didn't, and this is really upsetting. Even just a couple weeks ago, we were joking about his 1st grade day when the Japanese teacher emailed us about his unacceptable behavior in her class. He said, \"I remembered!\" I was actually rather surprised, and impressed. But then!? This!? This is really disappointing. Third, poor judgment. I really hate to say this, but putting your own face to someone's foot as a fun way to play, in class!!?, is just plain stupid. He was asking for it, asking for the damage, asking to be kicked. He didn't care a thing about what could have happened to his glasses, to his safety.. this is just, fxxxx, stupid! I wish the kid could have kicked a lot harder than just causing a bent glasses, if only he could then learn the lesson. I don't know. Sometimes I really feel he has a terrible judgement. I try to argue that it is his age, and his even less age than his calendar age psychologically. Yet, I really think this will carry into his life even when he is older. Poor judgment don't just go away. I have witnesses many in adults, and it just amazes me how and why these people could not comprehend — people racing to a red light, saying one thing while acting another, pretending what they are not, feeling blown up as if they were god, looking down people who serve them, believing a superficial statement w/o questioning or even thinking..... I don't know. By being different, Noah is actually becoming the very opposite of his wishes → he is becoming commonly mindless, stupid, mass.","tags":"thoughts","url":"https://fengxia41103.github.io/myblog/hard%20to%20listen.html"},{"title":"Total Happiness","text":"I was thinking. If we add up the total happiness of this world, versus all the grief, sadness, unhappiness, how would they come out to be? I'm depressed. Noah is not doing his homework at school, and he is moving too much in class, as usual. It pissed me off, and made me really feeling powerless. He is refusing to grow up, but I'm getting old, and nothing is being done. While I was feeling the blues, I start to wonder everyone I saw roaming around the campus whether s/he has a blue day also. I'm sure everybody has. I have long been convinced that there is nobody's life you would be willing to swap once you learn how messy and imperfect theirs is. Just like mine, just like yours. So if we ever add them all up, are there more happiness than unhappiness? On the one hand, we will all agree that happy time is much less than unhappy time in one's life. So it seems that by sheer number unhappiness will win. Then, when you are in love, the intensity of that happiness is so strong that it can probably offset a lot of unhappy days. But then, isn't there also a theory that people are more sensitive to loss than to gains? This would lead to the opposite conclusion that intensity of loss, thus unhappy days, more than that of happy days? Then, which is correct? I don't know. Blues, depression, frustration, days without excitement and without hope... it is certainly not fun. I try to picture a day by the Charles, watching sunset, watching people, watching geese flying by, watching the days go by. It's the same 24 hours like everywhere else on this planet. It doesn't change a thing, practically speaking. Will that really make a difference? If so, how different? and why different? I don't know. I guess people are yearning to a new environment, because, like taking vacation, you walk away from a set of life as if all the problems in that life can be ignored, made to disappear. Some of them will, actually, since new setting makes them not applicable anymore. Then, there are others, will not go away. They are more patient than we want them to be. They sit still, wait for you to come back, then reassert themselves in front of you, may not be all at once, but surely, persistently, stubbornly, like a trickle, they emerge silently onto the stage, even without a word, you know, it's there. I used to believe the total luck in one's life is a fixed number. Thus using it up front in your younger years will leave less for later, and vice versa. I wonder the total unhappiness in this world is a fixed number, too. Lovers generate happiness, few, but intense. The the same amount unhappiness is needed to counter balance them, spread out, like air, blanket many, maybe everybody, with a tint of blue. Like rain falling from sky, leave a few spots on everyone's t-shirt. Instead of being water, it's ink, permanent mark, a dot, tarnish a perfect white T, some finds it beautiful, some is annoyed, nobody has a detergent to wash it off. That's unhappiness, in life.","tags":"thoughts","url":"https://fengxia41103.github.io/myblog/total%20happiness.html"},{"title":"Life without meaning","text":"I don't know. All of a sudden while walking back from gym to office, I felt this moment of, emptiness. Really. It's a sensation I never had before. It's not a strong feeling, but distinctly there, that life is blank, meaningless. I lost the touch of what it is for, what there is to looked forward to, what is in there for me. The sky is blue, temperature comfortable, nothing dramatic in life, everyday is a routine. Why I had this feeling then? I missed you a lot today. I wanted to write you something. But we are soo far apart now, I don't even know what to call you anymore. I feel awkward to begin a letter, though I so want to chat with you, to learn what you are up to, how life has treated you, and whether you are happy. I'm worried. There have been many disturbing nights I dreamed of you. Waking up in the middle of night, I wanted to talk to you, hear your voice, to know you are ok. But then, I'm also afraid. I shouldn't interrupt your quiet life. You should live the way you want to, and secretly I'm still hoping that someday I will get a message from you, even just a hi , so I know you have not forgotten me. Is this silly? or just too idealistic? I don't know. This is part of me I can not change I guess. I have always been living in this idealistic world, in which there is no BS, no pretense, no self-importance, no so called conventional wisdom that 5-year apart is an ideal for a couple ← BS! total BS. Age should never be a factor to determine. After all, how many can you meet in life? and why age gap is anything but an invention of human since time itself is nothing but an invention? Further, why age is so important when we are young, yet when I get to 60s, suddenly I can marry someone in 40s and everyone will just be ok!? But it's 10+ years of gap! Why is it ok then, but not now? I hate this type of social norms. To me, they are not norms at all. They are sayings inherited from past but no one has questioned its standing, and everyone accepts it on face value. Sad. This leads all kinds of unhappiness for individuals whose heart says otherwise. This same bond has an effect on me also, that I felt uncomfortable w/ you because you are so young, so beautiful, so perfect. I wish I could live out of these things I hate. Yet, myself is caught in it and could not get away. How sad really! I guess I'm not really as strong as I picture myself to be, or wish myself to be. It takes two to make a couple. I think you did fine, it's me who is still a slave of convention. I don't know. Thinking of you fills my morning in many days. It's bitter an sweet.

Why is missing somebody so hard? Why is it that we will miss somebody, some days, some moments, some blinks in life, and they will never fade? I don't know whether it's just me or it's a human trait ← I always feel I'm living in the past. I always tried best to be nice and to appreciate the present. Yet, things inevitably slip into a past term, left me with nothing but a tremendous ocean of sadness and memory. But in memory, she lives, safe and sound, immune to time, immune to all the bad things in life, immune to hardship, forever young, forever lovely, forever beautiful, forever close by.","tags":"thoughts","url":"https://fengxia41103.github.io/myblog/burned%20out.html"},{"title":"2nd Child Policy","text":"This has to be the most disturbing talk I have ever heard so far, and this makes me very angry. The talk is about China's new policy to encourage having more than one child, and these people talked about possible ways to turn the tide of China's declining population. Sigh. But this is truly sad sad sad in multiple ways and it is totally disgusting, misleading, wrong, just morally wrong, technically wrong, politically wrong, and absolutely against humanity! 180 turn No where they every even dared to touch the No.1 topic I think they should have discussed ← this is truly an elephant in the room, yet everybody turns his head and as if it doesn't exist! How can a country reverse its one-child policy, the one that has been criticized by human right group, by UN, by everybody except China itself, just like that! How can this be acceptable!!! This speaks to a case in point of China's opaque decision making process that a policy that was sooo dear and soooo important that if you get caught you will be fined and be humiliated and even harmed in public, now suddenly, turns into a reverse gear, with equal justification, equal legitimacy, equal support by these experts!! This, to me, is the scarest thing! Come on. How can I trust such process that it does not turn on me someday and crush me because its agenda puts me in its way! This is like a HUGE truck on the road but switching lane at a blink of eye without giving signal, without apology, without any concern of who the hell is driving next it, or being on board! In daily life we will take this driver to be mad, to be irresponsible (in polite term), and will shun from him/her as much as we can. Yet, when it is a government, a country, no one, no one in this talk even dare to stand up to challenge authority with this question:\"So, were we wrong in the past!? If so, shouldn't you apologize!?\" Talking about 知识份子的良心, which I see none! Sigh.... this is total bullshit! total disgust! totally purely, wrong!.. You know, with such pattern unchallenged, such decision making unchanged, un-reviewed, un-criticized, un-punished, we are letting our own life to be manipulated, and eventually, to be crushed. for the greater good I have argued in too much trust in multi folds that anything, I mean, anything, that is titled as \"for a greater good\", should be carefully examined, eagerly questioned, cautiously observed, hardly participated, never (by all means) obeyed and adopted. How can anyone even allow such a saying as \"为国生娃\"!!!!!! Not to mention this State has not been a nice companion to be with!? Isn't this like asking a woman to bear you a child while you are treat her like trash!? and of course, your argument is that without me you would have been living on a street... doesn't this sound familiar to you!? Oh my god, how can anyone in 21st century, boasting to be educated, be civilized, be westernized, be modern, fall in such a stupidity!!! This is outrageous! Pure insanity! Stop preaching \"do this for your country\"!!! No, I don't want to give birth to my child because it is mainstream! No. I can do it for love, for a sexual need, for my own reason of any kind, but the last thing on my mind when I have sex is to be patriotic! How bizzare it is!! How dare you to ask me to do so!? leading to humanity disaster What they don't realize, and this truly saddens me and scares me, is that this argument is paving the way to a humanity disaster. Here is how this logic will unfold. First of all, this is total discrimination against age, against old people. I have long debated with myself that from an engineer's point of view to optimize efficiency and maximize social progress, I, if were a dictator, would have a policy to eliminate the elders as soon as his/her contribution is less than his/her cost ← but I could never bring myself to agree with such conclusion. This is wrong, even logically I think it is correct, but morally, humanely, personally, it is WRONG WRONG WRONG! We must be alarmed by the name aging society , which ironically has been on this path for the last 30+ years, and yet as if everybody is suddenly waking up from a dream, and switching immediately into a panic mode! Demographics can neither be increased in a short term, nor decreased in a short term. Period. Again, what we should have questioned is why China has been ignoring this long-term trend all along, and continue to treat this topic as if it's an on-off switch — turn it on, make 1 million babies, right now! This is fuxxed up. Paving a justification to view aging in such a negative way will lead to policy to remove \"un-contributing\" population ← this is nothing but the same method that all humanity disaster has started with, some kind of philosophy to: establish the objective to be optimal label and remove the inefficient ones Wake up people. You might be ok in your 20s, 30s, 40s, but such a mentality is a beast out of cage ← once it is out, it will crash and burn in blood, and it doesn't really care whose blood it takes. Second, when talking about policy to encourage birth , it is inevitably leading to a social view of some group being preferred to others. If, as one of the expert said \"for example, letting coastal residents to...\" (essentially enjoying a previlege of a kind), it is nothing but a one step away from what we have all learned in class, in TV, in any book of WWII, that \" people are inferior race... thus...\" ← you know what this is!? This is fascism, is racial discrimination, and can only be ended with war, with terrible social and human cost. How can anyone in today's civilization say such a thing without feeling shame!!?? geeee.... if only these people take a step back and read what I have just said, they will realize how terrible himself/herself has just sounded! self-conflicting It's a common saying, and is the baseline of all these people's argument, that people don't want to have more kids because: People with good education don't like to have babies because, it will lower their quality of life People who have good life don't like to have babies because, it will lower their quality of life. Well well well. Now let me ask you this: do you wish your kid to have a good/better life than yours? and do you wish them to have good/better education? I have yet to meet a single parent who says No to this. Well, then, following the initial logic, doesn't this mean that the next generation will have less babies because, they will have a better education & better life than their parents'!? So, if our goal is to reverse this population trend, it seems to me the logical step should be to lower education and to lower quality life of our next generation, so that they will be willing to give more birth! Now, people, will you still be patriotic ? You see, this is a completely conflicting logic that they are stating without thinking over how this will unfold. And honestly, let's be straight here: High education & life quality is not in negative correlation with child birth. On the contrary, parents wanting their kids to have a good life is a great thing. (Speaking for any parents), it is super important that the society in the future, in the next 25 years when my son grows up, is in a good shape. I want to do my part, not only for my own sake, but also for Noah to have a good life. That, is a strong motivation, to be a good citizen, to be a good person (role model) in life, and to make a new generation of intelligence, of knowledge, and of kindness. Education makes people criticize more, challenges status quo more, thus having less confidence in a rosy future for the next 25 year if things are let be without checks. I think this is actually why many of those who has received high education don't want to have kids ← not that they have less sexual drive, but they have a deeper understanding of things, of human, of society, of what the next 25 years may be like, and a stronger will to determine his/her own life, and a stronger feeling of responsibility when there is a child. Therefore, education is not the enemy of child birth, nor the cause of decline of population. So really, people. This logic can not be true! It's an urban myth at most. Stop quoting it for your statement. It, in my view, is FALSE. responsibility How can young parents make a condition that if only State/company/society makes raising a baby easier, I would have had more kids!???? I totally agree, that raising a kid is hard. Yet, we parents also agree that we love them, wish them the best, though they have brought us the most frustrating experience, most agonizing moment, most tiresome nights & days, most anxious episodes.... we regret, sometimes, sincerely, anger sometimes, uncontrollably, totally at lose of what to do with them, too many times... yet, we deal with it, try not to give it up, peddle water to keep head above water, to put out as much to support them, to give them a good life. I can use some help, for sure. But it is not a condition. Child is the result of a love, or a passionate night. She is not a bargain chip, not a prerequisite ← I have always advised young friends to forget about \"I want to get ready before having a kid\" ← you simply have no way to be ready . God deals you a child, if he chooses so, and you deal with it. Period. You can never be ready. And it becomes even more bizarre that if society supports the old, young people can be more creative, more productive ... are you fxxxxing kidding me!!??? You might as well just say, you know what, if only society takes care of all my problems, I'll be a happy man. Give me break!! Kid, parents, this is all your responsibility. Yes, responsibility is not fun. But no, without it your life will not be paradise. On the contrary, I would guess it will be quite miserable ← if your creativity and productivity is depending on so called social support to such a degree, man, I can bet you are neither creative nor productive. I guarantee it, because you are nothing but a selfish, grown-up baby. last line I haven't been so annoyed and so angry with something like this for a while. This is really sad. I hate this talk. Honestly, I worry about China. I think it's going in a direction that people would suffer greatly. I'm seeing it unfold in front of my eyes. But mostly, I worry about Siqi. She has a full life ahead of her. I will regret dearly if she were caught in such turmoil someday. I wish I could have helped her from going through this; I wish I could be there if the tide comes to her; I wish I could bring her to safety, or at least, peddle the boat for her, so she will be ok.","tags":"thoughts","url":"https://fengxia41103.github.io/myblog/2nd%20child%20policy.html"},{"title":"Hurricane","text":"So there is a hurricane coming to NC. The curious thing, however, is that there is an air of excitement in the air ← everybody is rushing to grocery to stock up food, people calling each other just to exchange that Costco has run out of water since yesterday .. actually now thinking back, I think this same pattern has played out also when Boston was hit by snow storms, that people were both nervous and excited. To think of it, I think this speaks about human psychie. First of all, this risk is certainly not really being taken as a risk, at all. Let me ask you this, if this risk is plainly a risk that you won't survive if caught in it, will you even feel any chance of \"yeah let's go to buy some bottle water!?\" The underline message of this madness is that all these people are 100% sure that they will survive, they will be fine, and hardly they even expect their daily convenience will be interrupted at all ← here is my toilet flushing, my running water so I can take shower, and Netflix works smoothly, maybe even my 5G is never down so I can update my profile w/ some stormy pictures... this is nothing but a kid's thriller ride in a theme park:\"ahhhhh.....\" splash... all soaking wet, but everybody is laughing. Doesn't this speak for human's tendency to underestimate risk, or putting in an encouraging spin, that human is optimistic? Secondly, excuses. I think human needs excuses, in order to justify their action, especially the ones that they know themselves that they are unusual, outliers. For example, everybody is driving in a rush with a sense of emergency and purpose. How interesting! Everybody is a on mission, \"I need to get to the store\" \"I need to buy this\"... for a cause that human has no control whatsoever, it is the perfect clause to give everybody a purpose, instantly. Since no one's action caused this hurricane, my madness of driving and honking and impatience at the checkout line is perfectly justified, understood, if not absolutely expected. Does this speak for built-in self-importance that everybody has? Yes I think so. Hurricane is a God's act, it's meant to remind his creation that regardless how much steel you have, you can be crushed easily with his whip. Yet, the contrary is achieved ← everybody is made important, is feeling important. If God is watching, he has to be upset, \"what the heck!?\" Third, living for a purpose. Ordinary life is boring, purposeless. Having a kid gives one a purpose, so each parent acts with a will of steel. Same when there is a crisis in a scale, a natural disaster, a war, a movement, a tribal fight..... human needs something in mind in order to feel life. The day when I have a thought to write or a diagram to create, I feel good. But how could that be!? Don't we all hate tasks? when did you ever feel happy when your boss walks to you and said \"here I got you 10 more things to do\"!? Then why having something-to-do actually makes you, excited!? I think at least there is a different between being excited versus being happy. My theory is that the excitement raises your energy level so you don't feel as tired, therefore it appears that you are happier! Anyway. People need tasks, need to-dos, I think the difference is tasks that are doable & I need it anyway , are ok; the work ones are the I dont know how to do this either kind, and that tips people off. Fourth, god-send-vacation. This natural disaster must be bad for business owners. I just watched a girl from nearby Chinese restaurant walking to grocery and came back w/ nothing in hand. I guess their business model has been that zero stock of ingredient but re-stock from this grocery when running low. This is common but how they are going to operate today when everybody is rushing to this same grocery to buy out EVERYTHING!? But for corporate employees, this is really really good — no responsibility, no obligation, plenty possibility down the line, and zero fault! This is free-jail card. What a relief for everybody when life itself is full of responsibility and deadlines? You know, I kind of wonder whether we should call this natural disaster, or a natural holiday!? I vote for holiday, because it really is. Fifth, community feeling. It has long been rumored that human is social animal, that you feel better when connected with other human beings. The problem, of course, is that few is connected to you, and you are willing to connect to few. All of sudden, now everyone is in this same group of potential victim — we have one common topic to talk, to exchange a few lines of caring and warm feeling, to shed a sense of humor in face of danger (which I have already argued that this is not taken as danger at all), and to feel being part of a greater something . How fascinating!? I have always criticized this tendency of human being herded into belief of a \"greater good\" which led to terrible human tragedy, and I have always wished people to have more independent thinking. Yet, witnessing this episode proves to myself that this is such a built-in character that changing it is like asking a person to walk on one leg only when he has two ← it is entirely unnatural. But is philosophy then a losing battle? I sincerely wish not. Yet, this does highlight the tragedy that lies within, that human race is doomed to be caught by propaganda, by a version of a greater good someone preaches... it's like drug, once you are part of some group, it's hard to pull yourself out of, be it a love relationship, a team, a school, a company, a church, or in today's scene, a hurricane. We are eager to find common denominator, we are ready to accept a denominator, we are nothing but a list of common denominators (this sounds very much like the \"who am I, and who are you\" argument I put in social media ). In the end, I went shopping w/ Noah after his Kumon also. The moment I walked in and saw shelves of green in produce cooler & buckets of fruits of all kinds (and there are watermelons the size to feed a family for a week!), well, there isn't really much reason to feel nervous then → I can live off a week of vegetables and fruits. It's good to your health!","tags":"thoughts","url":"https://fengxia41103.github.io/myblog/hurricane.html"},{"title":"Accelerated anonymity","text":"It feels that everything is converging. Sometimes I feel this is the sign of aging, too, that by being in 40s and started to understand just about every topic and have an opinion of them, every book I read and every talk I listen to start to convey the same message and contribute to my way of logic in a supportative way. This is both assuring, and alarming — I enjoy the sense that my view finds more agreement and seemingly more supports, but am deeply worried that I'm being cherry picking of evidence actively so to find comfort and enforce an already formed view. The the latter I am truly concerned because this is exactly the behavior and symptom I am advocating against. Yet, like everything in life, there seems to be built-in contradiction in everything — that your strength must also be your weakness, the most you think you believe and you want to promote turns to be the exact opposite of your preach! I don't know. I feel fundamentally I'm just not that smart, don't have much to offer, yet want to feel important, to justify your own being, being valuable, being smarter than many , being a good person, being a thinker ← really, just whatever image I want to project of myself, that's the deep down motives, yet I'm motivated by it exactly because I don't have it, and chances because I'm not capable of achieving it (thus don't have it yet), Therefore, the louder I'm speaking in that term, the louder I'm really announcing to the world that I am not that. How tragic. This leads to the topic of what I want to discuss today, what I call acclerated anonymity . There is a common theme wherever I turn, that people in society has this anxiety to become known , recognized, agreed upon. Why!? In this Japanese movie, Tokyo Story , a common acknowledgment of price one pays by going to a big city like Tokyo is that you becomes insignificant, an ant. There are millions of you out there, doing the same thing, living the same life, thus yourself becomes a person without identity. This exact same feeling is being echoed in this generation in China, and perhaps in previous generations also when people were literally treated as trash and a part-of some great-good. So tools such as social media becomes immensely popular because we now have a channel to make yourself seen and heard, and even applauded. We are all on a stage putting on a show, and waiting for audience to show up, to admire us, to get some eyeballs, and to get, if not financial benefit, at least emotional benefit. This same logic also intensifies the sensation of love, that out of this billion people or million people, s/he finds me, and likes me, and even adores me, what's the odds! what a fate! Then, there is marketing, images of a life that feels ready-to-be-owned if only you put out your credit card, now, painless, effortless, reasonable, entitled, of course. The book of image explained well that this is only made possible with advent of mass production that what used to be available only for the elites and the rich, is now lowered in price that commoners can afford also, with a bit alternation in form, in exquisiteness, in quality, in feel, in originality, in its emotional meaning, and sometimes even in practical usage. But no matter, there you have it, even as a mockup, as a counterfeit, as a A货， as 山寨, it's better than none, than nothing (actually, doesn't this feel like the POC valud I hold so dear!? that the leap from 0 to 1 is qualitative, while 1-N is quantitative). Fascinating. But then, this anxiety, this feeling of not-being-recognized, is accelerating. Going into a crowd makes you feel small; a growing population, or just being in a country of large population, highlights this instantly. So everybody is desperately holding on some identity, internally and externally, to prove his/her existence. Therefore, the LV, the vanity, the fashion, the wechat and your fans... but then, what is the alternative? what is the other extreme? seclusion!? that doesn't sound good either. And arguably, what about book authors? those really master pieces, and music, and essays, thoughts, philosophies... they didn't just write them for their self entertaining, did they!? They wanted their voice and opinion to be heard, to be adopted. So can I say they were also just as vain as us who wants to buy identity with $$? It does seem that we are on equal footing in this aspect. But theirs are, more complex? more advanced? more influential? I don't know. So indeed, this feeling/desire of being somebody is universal and true. It must be part of a human mind. It's there, and we are born with it. There is nothing wrong about this anxiety. It's as natural as eating and shitting, just that it needs to be understood and handled. My reading of all these phenomenon is that this growing intensity of becoming known is exactly a mirror image of population expansion, and progress of large scale coorperation that answers growing complexity of problem human society is to solve (and doesn't this in turn create more complex problems? how self-propelling this is!) But then, what is the other extreme, that a tribe with a handful of residents, you know everyone by name and their family tree back to a few generations, even with blood ties all the way back!? Does it then alleviate or even remove such desire to known ? and also, at least we will agree that being known is different from being agreed with. But in today's anonymity, these two are essentially the same motivation ← if not seeking an agreement, then why bother to be known!? Then why, why we are so eager to seek an agreeing voice? Is it because we just lack self-confidence? why now? and did we have this crisis in a tribe mode? What happens that your opinion was not agreed by tribe members? well, I guess then you will be kicked out, and die, so there is natural selection at work, haha. But then, today's society is practicing this same act, that especially in a (closed-minded) society, different opinion is not welcomed, is surpressed, is to be removed and its owner silienced and even eliminated ← but this should not be justified, should it!? I don't know. The core has not changed, but the scale has changed . The growth of sheer number of population, the growing interconnection from tribe to State to now Globalization, the growing level of coordination in production especially in procurement and assembly (I still firmly believe the logistics of physical goods are soooo much more difficult than sending bits over a wire) → these are driving what we feel as the acceleration of anonymity. Is it bad? No. It's annoying, but inevitable. It's what makes our life better than an ancient king, but also drives us nuts. Just like everything else, this is another case of built-in contradiction of existence → the strength is the weakness, the benefit is the cost. No escape, always true. ah, hope Here is a good news → there is hope! If you live in middle income (XP) countries, you are out of luck because population is growing; if you are in high income (XD) countries, your anxiety has a hope ~~","tags":"thoughts","url":"https://fengxia41103.github.io/myblog/accelerated%20anonymity.html"},{"title":"Too much trust","text":"It has become a cliché that China nowadays are lacking trust. It has been talked about as if it would be the root cause of all disturbing social phenomenon as well as the one single cure of all social disease ← if only there were trust between people, between vendor and customer, between government and its subordinates, between investor and business owners... especially w/ backdrop of ZTE (which is being depicted as a case of not keeping its promise ) and the most recent fatal crime by Didi driver. We want trust; we need trust; let's restore trust. But, and this is really a big BUT. But, I would argue exactly the opposite! No, this society is not lacking trust. On the contrary, China lacks criticism, suspicion, argument, challenge, show-me-the-proof mentality. The very last thing they should promote is exactly not trust, but everything that speaks and yells and shouts with a stern, dirty, annoying look \"I don't trust!\". That's right. You heard me. Isn't the blind trust that people dive into whatever the government's policy says, eg. 大众创新， 工业4.0, 人 工智能，大数据, because they argued that the most trustworthy entity in this society is the government, because, well, you can't trust anyone else. So authority becomes the last hope to represent trust. Then, exactly because the same blind trust of so called knowledge , expert , even history , book , theory , and even a neutral word such as data (which I have argued in data digit & data & credit score that China has totally misunderstood, perhaps intentionally, about the meaning of data, and is actively abusing the word data up to what I would simply call an intellectual crime ), that has misled audience astray with or without a dark thought of manipulation — with, in the sense that many do know what they are selling; without, in the sense, that many do believe what they are selling (and this is infinitely worse because they are becoming sincere liers ). This is not only scary, but outright wrong, and is the root cause of all these sad, really, sad, reality that is being unfolded in front of our eyes. Why would I trust a stranger and get into his car? why should I trust a company who actively advocate that ride is fun because you can have encounter w/ pretty girl as passenger? why should I trust government's policy if his track record has shown over and over and over again that: he never admits he did anything wrong he never said \"I'm sorry\" he changes his mind 180 degrees in many occasions, which had brought tremendous headache to your private life — how about the policy of having baby, for one example? and the right to buy a house, for another? and hi never discloses his decision making process, nor his budget book. If taking him as an individual person, I challenge anyone would say, \"you know what!? He is a great guy, let's marry my daughter to him.\" So, why should there be any trust !? Then, all the BS data published, all the BS theory circulating in wechat and among friends & family, all the BS advice to be long-lived or just to be healthy.... everything, I do mean everything, should be challenged, should be criticized, and should be suspected! There isn't such a thing as TRUST. As a matter of fact, I would say TRUST can only exist when the foundation is being extremely doubtful, thus extremely cautious, thus extremely conservative and protective. TRUST only exist when there is an army of measure to deal with it when it goes wrong relative to 1 that describes the \"right\" scenario ← like writing programs, really, the majority of the code is to deal with conditions or guard conditions that will crash the system, while only a minor amount will end up being the feature implementation. Follow this you can even argue that all the code to deal with alternative course (in UML's syntax) is part of the feature/requirement itself, and that's exactly right. Will you trust a car that have no brake, just because its normal course/main feature is that it moves forward!? Will you trust yourself, at all, if there is no hospital/doctor ever, in this world, because the normal course of life is be in the same state tomorrow like today, and today like yesterday?... you get the idea. It will be simply crazy to agree that normal course is all; and it's simply a crime if normal course is being presented as the ONLY course possible, available, or advisable. Then, why the hell you would trust an author and his/her saying while there is no counter arguments !? why to trust a data when nowhere in its analysis it first defines its assumptions? why to trust a government policy that you can only hear exactly ONE WAY of interpretation , while in fact NO LANGUAGE in the world, including math, is capable to do that!? Think about it, even the Bible, which speaks THE TRUTH, has different ways to read its story and message. And there it is, a policy rolled out fresh out of oven, is being viewed without ambiguity, without doubt, without challenge, without critics, without uproar from somebody, some group → this just can not be! This only means one thing, that opinions have been suppressed, and whoever is promoting this wants you to have one possible conclusion. But now since I have laid these out flat, if you look at this logic chain again, I will be really curious that who would want to do that to you!? and who would want to live in that!? China needs anti trust , someone like me, a lot of me. Trust, is a result, of debate, proof, and clarity; it is not a cause. Whoever promotes this idea is actually getting it reversed. Well, see, I'm practicing my own preach here → I don't trust these guys, don't take their statement easily. People will find me just annoying, I guess. But it's ok. I trust my own judgement more than others'. I trust quite a few authors, whose book and writing, though I don't understand, I find them intriguing — social contract , the road to serfdom — am I committing the same foolishness that I'm criticizing here!? No. I trust them, exactly because all these writings are in tone and in spirit of do not trust !

I can still feel the day, the day that he was coming to this world, and the day it was a hot summer day, and I was biking between hospital and home. He came at 1pm, the same time when my brother passed away. I joked that he was him reborn into this family. This gave my moom, and everyone in the family, a comfort, that he is back to us again, in Noah's body, and will be loved and cherished and spoiled, as if it is a second chance for everybody, like a lost, found. I wanted to believe that myself, too. I missed Lei. It is becoming less frequent now that I will think of him. But he is still there. I wish there were more I could have done at the time, to ease his pain. I wish I had been more mature, more independent, and more thoughtful, and more wise perhaps, to know what to do, and to do what is well, and right. Yet, time is indeed a passing river, never stops for anyone, for any soul... how funny this is! that time is purely a human invention, yet, we are so at the mercy of it, that we could only look at it with a deep sigh, and nothing, absolutely nothing, we can do about it. I told Noah many times that there are many things I can help him with, but there is one thing nobody can give him more, and that is time. I was saying so to get him some sense of time. But it is true. Time flies, life is like a summer, with a flash, the summer of life is gone. I start to feel the age, start to see that the summer of my life is at its end, and it does feel rather sad. Then, here is Noah, double digit now, and this summer has felt really short. People say time starts to accelerate once kids are growing up.

He is eloquent, which I have the impression that his mind runs million miles per second. You can feel it's churning at a speed so to compose the next line and the next thought, which now while writing, feels so different from Linus , whose Q&A sessions filled w/ pauses that he would try to express his view while choosing words, but at the end of day it was just a topic he had no feeling of, and no interest in, which quite like what I feel these days → you feel compelled to express if you have a view and have a feeling of something, someone; while for others, well, I really don't care, and have no interested in saying anything, whether it is pleasing to audience or not. What touched me, and got me think today, is Frank said about technology. He asked technology to think harder how people can use it in a self-serving way, and to build a box around it so to circumvent its abuse. This is quite in the same call that people talk about facebook fiasco, which I have ranted my view on social media . It feels right, and actually I'd like to see it happen. But as an engineer who implements these technology, I feel challenged. it is actually practical First of all, I don't think it is practical to even foresee how people can abuse your technology. Like when any sharp knife is banned on airplane after 911. To me, if I'm intending to do harm to people, then without accessing to a sharp knife becomes an inconvenience, not a stopper. What about the fork they issued you at lunch? and even a chord of some sort will be enough to strangle someone. But I also think this logic is valid, because this is the same for, say, bike locks, that it doesn't stop bike thief, just makes his stealing harder, takes longer, thus increasing his risk of being caught, which in turn deterring him from trying. Therefore, the prevention logic is not to stop, but to raise the bar so your determination has to rise higher than before in order to tip off to the evil side. Yes if you are hardcore, nothing is going to stop you; well, then, since being a hardcore is not defined, quantified, and rare, thus playing w/ human nature of being lazy and satisfied w/ mediocrity, this strategy will work. Make sense. build-in to fail But even so, there can be million ways to self-serve my technology, which, if I were the inventor, can not be held responsible because I just could not know. Think about kids. Any parent can relate million stories when kid picks up something and use it in a creative way, which in adult's eyes it was purely playing w/ fire! We will yell at the kid, blame the supervising adult, but also like to hear some apologies from that manufacturer/inventor, for a emotional comfort I guess. Why so!? I think underline there is this feeling of guilt when things like that happen. Parent feels bad of themselves since they are the one responsible for enlightening the kid not to do such thing. They also feel bad that their breed turn out to be absent-minded adventurer (and don't all parents think their child is the best, smartest, or at least we all hope/wish so, even reality speaks differently!?), which is against his/her view of their product. Then, if Eve ate the apple, snake is to be hated, thus the external influences — manufacturers, bad friends, commercials, violent movies, and so on. The apple also appears to be in fault ← why are you so enticing!? If only you taste just bad, then the kid would not have taken attention of you! I don't know. I think the chain can go quite long, and you can see many echos in these chain that, in different story lines, a couple of these points are manifested to be the top-level significance, but eventually w/ discussion developed, all these points (and more) will be linked and derived, so that essentially this loop of logics keep repeating themselves. This then raises a question — if we will drag out all these points anyway in all the incidents, then we really don't have a clue of what to blame, and how to solve it then! If borrowing a common cliche in love scene, that if your relationships always go sore in the same way ← meeting the same type of date, had similar process then similar breakups, then there is built-ins of you is the cause, because you are the common denominator ! Therefore, parallelly, if we always feel these steps in the logic above when something goes awry, shouldn't it also point to a built-in feature of you (or the kid) that is actually the common denominator!? I think so. It's not the apple, or the snake. It is Eve herself, who possessed this sense of curiosity stronger than, say, Adam, thus she is receptive to snake's talk, thus have a lower bar to become her version of hardcore → nothing is going to stop her from tipping off, if it wasn't the apple, the story will be a pear, or a peach, or, how about an evil watermelon!?... hahaha.... what's the solution This leads another conversation. We all talk about social responsibility, or just responsibility in general. I do think people, or good people, are responsible people. But then, since we can't not foresee how a product can be used by bad people, how can I claim to be a responsible engineer? Are we at mercy of these bad/creative guys who use our technology for an end which we disagree? and how can we gain/regain control if we don't like at mercy in others' hands? In the aftermath of WWII, people pleaded for conscience of bad guys that they lost common sense and committed horrible deeds. But they also evoked the same logic to defend themselves that their job/task was but a screw on a giant machine, what's for the screw to know and to determine this machines does, and to stop it!? There is question about information ← whether screw is made to be aware of the machine's function, and his role in it; and another question of capability ← that screw can cripple this machine. Both of these, are easier said than done, and I think that is the reality. But there is hope, and hope lies in recognition of free information flow assisted w/ technology. If you look at the question above, the capability has an underline message that a screw is too small of a scale in front of machine. Yet, quantity will change it, because the machine is composed nothing but all these screws! So when 1 screw changes nothing, 90% of screws can not stop the machine, it can change this machine into something entirely different, like transformer! So how to amass quantity? Brain wash, of course, for one. But I will never agree w/ that, because it is a top-down approach — an idea is imposed upon us, not our own ideas bubbling up. The key, is information free flow. Only by informing this single tiny screw of the entire machine, of what his role affects the outcome, can the screw makes a link — some crew cares, some don't; some makes a link that is factually right, while others make skewed version — no matter! Only with this background can one be possible to see result of his action, even remotely, and start to build a sense of his role and his effect, and this is the foundation of developing responsibility. Therefore, technology itself has not right or wrong. It's a tool. User has built-ins that she can do nothing about, and will manifest on these tools in a way that was unexpected. That's fine. Human nature, is, nature. As long as we allow such incidents be reported, evaluated, and learn to build guards around these past incidents, we are on the path of becoming responsible. I don't believe there is an end game, like the ultimate responsibility of some kind, so being on the trajectory and has the capability to iterate so to approximate an ideal state, even indefinitely unachievable, is all we need, is all we got.","tags":"thoughts","url":"https://fengxia41103.github.io/myblog/technology%20responsibility.html"},{"title":"Social media","text":"The recent downfall of Facebook stock and its data privacy fiasco have been spectacular, and saddening. People are talking about data privacy as if it is an evil just releases from Gene's bottle, and of course, when a giant like Facebook shows a crack, millions are worked up to bring it dow, for its great tragedy that years later all MBA books and zillion talks on evolution of technology will have a lot of fun to awe its audience, and for profiting from such a downfall if only it is so predictable and exciting, like any revolution that mobs are bringing down the ruling authority and everyone sees an opportunity to reshuffle the social deck he or she has been given, and maybe this time a better card will be in hand. All in all, this is a true irony, that the social networking giant is facing a social force that it both created, and in an arena he is the king. But really, what I want to talk about is something even more fundamental than privacy, and more worthwhile to debate and reflect, if not alarmingly being too little, too late. Because over the last 10 years, the word social networking has been hailed as the gospel of the future, but truly this was done more genuinely than what is of those buzz words flooding the media nowadays such as AI, big data anaylsys, or sharing economy, since it does touch something core to human existence, on which I will be discussing in this essay. Social media and social networking have indeed transformed communication method that people are device-savy are engaging. Not only it is convenient to talk to your dad and mom internationally or nationally; it has become a forum of ideas, opinions, life in a real-time sense, and manifested and recorded in a degree that has never happened and possible in the past. One hundred or one thousand years later historians and researchers will face an overwhelmingly amount of day-to-day or even minute-to-minute data to reconstruct what our life in year 2018 is like. No more speculation and guess work from some books written decades since the even happened, and from debris or broken pieces of archaeology artifacts to derive/reverse-engineer what is like. If assuming that data is still readable then, and data is processable and understandable then, then this generation must be the one that has been mostly documented, recorded, manifested as if everyone is on a stage, hunger for information and for attention. I'm not a fan of posting my life, nor a fan seeing alerts/updates of someone I know has just left for lunch, or having a cup of coffee, everyday at this time. But it' ok if you like to make your life known, however the side you choose to show, prefer to be remembered, and be eager to run away from. I have no problem with this at all. But there is other things of social networking that I feel deserve much attention, which unfortunately has not been given by media, by public, by private citizen, by everyone whose reference of daily life and meaning is being changed by them. torturing yourself Watching any wechat user, or any of the 13 billion Chinese walking on the street, standing on escalator, sitting somewhere, eating, riding a subway, climbing stairs, dating with friends, gathering with family, participating a meeting, talking to client or boss or whoever, toileting... if driving and texting is bad, then I think shitting and wechatting is disgusting, disturbing, humiliating, bizzare, degrading, unhealthy, and utterly covering your beloved phone with germs and god knows what, and for no good reason whatsoever. Because if you are only willing to take one step back out of this fantastic high of constant suspension (yes indeed this is the suspense movie you are starring!), I highly suspect any part of your life is living such a cutting edge and importance that it can not be missed, even for a few minutes. Really, even God rests on Sunday, whom do you think you are!? This level of anxiety , yes, if you are a social networking user, you are anxious , is just bizzare! This is worse than mid-age crisis, because it does not care whether your true age is mid or not. The anxiety to see a response to your message in a bottle is getting to your nerve — oh mine mine mine, did s/he say something to my post? ... oh nothing yet... <20 seconds later> .... didn't I feel the phone just lighted up? there is new message!....<20 seconds later>... maybe it's here now... I'm always watching such strange reality show with an urge to laugh and to pity — at the end of day, why put yourself through such a misery by torturing yourself with anxiety, by caring so much how others react to you, how they comment on a conversation, how they view your activity, how they think about you, how they like or dislike you!? I understand the argument that as a social member, as all human are meant to be one, and gively I agree with this statement, thus a person must care about others' view of you, makes a kind gesture to fit in, and be a good citizen ← it's duty, built-in requirement, thus inevitable, necessary, and justified. I get it. I'm not against human society, relationship, even though I'm quite anti-social these days that I don't enjoy hanging out with people I don't enjoy hanging out with, and I don't give a fxxx who the fxx this person is if s/he is someone I'm interested in knowing, am happy to be with, and am willing to have a relationship. But really, often than not I think this argument is only borrowed by the person to justify his checking-my-phone-every-20-seconds behavior. Fundamentally, s/he take herself/himself too seriously. Universe is rotating around her, thus if you have not yet responded to her message, you must be composing it as we speak, or must be digesting her meaningful words and formulating a reply in mind... either way, your mind is occupied by this input, and should display CPU 100% on all cores, and all memory used up! But the reality is, how many people in your life you would care so much!? I know one, and you probably have, whatever, a few, a dozen?.... it won't be many, that's the point, because if there are many, then you are either playing a God's role, or you are treating them equally shittyly, because you don't know what care means . So, now take a flip side of this, how many would consider you as that person s/he cares!? Equally, the odds is pretty low. So really, if you feel otherwise, either you are in love, or you are in a high and refusing to wake up. This is not some dark theory I'm proposing on human. This is how human emotion is — emotion is an expansive item to have, it take s tremendous energy, space, life. Most of us so called common people simply have no such capacity to create that much caring and love that can drive and support the type of anxious-of-your-response pattern! We just can't, and will not. Therefore, bringing such an anxiety on yourself is completly rootless, and can only be viewed as a sign of poor judgement of yourself, your social networking participants, and the word relationship in general. slowing down your brain Another effect of social media, and enabled by technology, is that your day is becoming a long list of [20, 20, 20, 20......] (in seconds). Not only the anxiety and disappointment of not seeing a response tortures your mind, this pattern forces your brain to constantly doing a context switching ← ask your IT friend, if he is worth his salt, he will know the conclusion, that context switching is expansive . It is necessary, but any designer will show his smartness by avoiding unnecessary switching whenever possible. This is not just a technical talk of optimization; this is basic principle, because at the end of day, your brain is what defines you, no one yet I know of is willingly to be called \"slow\", or \"stupid\", and we often laugh at animals such as Dash (Zootopia) because he reacts slooooooooowly! Then why the heck you want to slow down your brain by forcing it to context switching every 20 seconds!!!!???? Isn't this, stupid, or what!? prisoner of diversity Have your noticed, heard, and must have experienced, that by so called user profiling backed by big data analysis and AI, that on one hand you don't need to bother with Amazon search much at all, since all the products you bought, often buy, likely to be interested, aligned with your shopping cart history, derived from what they know about your needs, your taste, your life, are right there! How convenient! Then, at the same time, Youtube becomes static, any recommendation of the sort described above becomes, STATIC . You are seeing recommendations as your top choice, and the more you choose from them, well, the stronger a belief that you do like this type of stuff! → this is becoming completly self-propelling and self-fullfilling ! This actually proves a point I have longed to state, that when information becomes overwhelmingly abundant, a person will be saturated (again, see my brain analysis in previous section), thus his only method to handle this is to limit inputs , thus we are seeing proliferation of the reader's digest of book club dressed in name of condensed information (or even more shamelessly, educator in a 21st form, give me a break!!), and also, profiling. Both share the same characteristics that please make a decision for me — you know, I'm not sure they are doing anything wrong while writing this line, because I suspect human, or most people, are just lazy, they don't like to think, to explore. I think this is explained by my context switching argument above!!! How nice! So well, my point is that these so called recommendations and what-you-know-about-me (even-better-than-myself!) urban myth, are putting us into a prison of diversity of views. Our inputs are converging, willingly and unknowingly, thus our outputs will also converge, which re-inforces the legitimacy of those choices given to us, not chosen by us . If you enjoy anxiety, this is actually something worth feeling anxious about — that we are losing not only the ability to choose, but the options to choose from. In today's social networking high, we are feeling not too few, but too many choices. But if not careful, this exactly fact is driving us into the other extreme, that we will still have more than ever to choose from, just they are becoming the same!! Remember Ford's T-model? that we can make it any color you want, as long as it is black. Wow. who am I, and who are you If I have not scared you up to this point, there is one more thing that social networking has done a wonderful job that is even more spectacular than smashing your waking time to pieces — it has smashed yourself into pieces. Every person is a unity of God knows how many different persons in one body — there is part of you who loves badminton, another part who loves music, another who loves books, another who loves woman or man or whatever, another who enjoys computer, another who loves family, another who cares your ex girlfriend(s), ..... you get the picture. There isn't, has never been, a single YOU. There has always been a bundle of different you, that is being simplified, labeled as, you. What the social networking does is to bubble these sides of you up and manifest them so that now you are member of a history group because you all love reading history books, a member of the kids club because all of your kids are rising 4th grade, a member of this interest group, a member of that, a member of ..... so what used to be a blob of blur, a feel and a preference that is fuzzy, hard to define and hard to describe, now social networking computers have built abstracts and database models to define them precisely and accurately (remember, they know better of yourself than you do), and all these sides are now clearer than ever, almost even defined, and certainly visible, and you are actively aware of their existence. While you are excitingly discovering yourself and finding it satisfying that these many sides of you have all found its groups, you have also submitted yourself to be re-defined in a modular fashion. The good news is that this is exactly how dating app works, that you fill in a form to describe you, and computer uses these attributes of you to match for literally a percentage of similarity — you two have 80% in common in term of hobbies! wow, very likely you will like each other! Actually, this, if not deciphering the mystery of LOVE, is helping to improve the odds of initial success (well, initial is hard, but a success in marriage is much much harder, and odds by looking at court filings doesn't look encouraging). But then, what is a marriage anymore, if I'm only loving the 20% of you!? or even 80%, 90%!? What about the 10% left!? Do I seek to satisfy that outside the marriage ? Is it then justified for me or for you to do so? After all, look, math is pretty clear here, 100% overlapping is an impossibility, so we all have to live with a gap here — this actually feels right, because we have all know that no one is perfect, and some will even take this further to state that no one is perfect for you... haha.... Well, so when I talk you next time, or work with you, or having a coffee, which part of you am I talking to? looking at? having a relationship with? Do I even need to ask or confirm or request that a particular side of you is the one I want to talk to, to love, to care? and even with such possibility, what if you disagree, but willing to give me the \"I love fashion\" side of you to be with my \"let go for a movie\" side of me!? Is this a mismatch? or just fine? This is just, weird.","tags":"thoughts","url":"https://fengxia41103.github.io/myblog/social%20media.html"},{"title":"UML","text":"Finally a book on UML that makes sense to me (and is short enough so I was willing to read it, in one morning). Milestone 1: requirement review Everything starts with an analysis of the problem at hand. One thing learned and I'd like to clarify is requirement — it is a set of constraints (thus the word must , should ). Requirements often cause confusion as they are taken as the system's objectives → in essence they are, but they are measured as a set of conditions that the system will have to behave within boundary . Thus, viewing them as the law for your design , it's a valid test to your test, but your design can come in many forms, and that's where engineering has some fun. So it becomes clear & natural that design and implementation are like people living in society → his behavior is completly boxed by law he has to obey, that's the minimal. Anything that no law permits nor prohibits (functions that links to no requirements), well, is just to keep the developers happy. Problem domain problems Any description of what the client is trying to do or what they want. There is no restriction at all. What comes out of it are: requirement domain modeling requirement Uses shall , must . Have a N-N mapping to use case → traceability from requirement → design → code → test. Many ways to cut it: functional requirement, data requirement, performance requirement, and so on. A use case describes a unit of behavior. Requirements describe the laws that govern that behavior. Functions are the individual actions that occur within that behavior. domain modeling Quite similar to ERD from Django graph. The difference is that it doesn't yet care attributes or methods, and they are not necessarily translated 1-1 into a DB table. Pick out the nouns → domain models Formulating 3 relationships: generalization: parent → children class aggregation: roll up, eg. DailyRecord → MonthlyRecord association: the closest understanding I can get is to describe the many-to-many relationships. use case This is the soul of UML (or at least for this book) since everything derives from it. Inputs: domain models & requirements. Two types: basic course of action alternative course of action → thus we can cover any exceptions we need to handle. Go expansive on case statement. We want to derive two things out of it: actor domain objects What helps ← visual and mockup user experience: GUI prototyping write a user manual in use case statement, or reverse engineering case statements from a legacy user manual wire frame, or any kind of GUI mockup Ask: what happens → then → then.... use the word invokes and precedes . what else can happen? → alternative course Being thorough is key Once you have done so called analysis, you reach the first milestone — requirement review. That's when client should sign off to recognize these set of use case do represent what they want to do. Milestone 2: design review With a set of use cases, we can break them down into design elements. This book talks in context of OOD, thus words like model and object are essentially a CLASS in code. We don't have to be bound by this. Instead, taking model as an abstract — it can be a database table, or a service — it's just a representation of a logical element that describes our view of breaking down the initial problem into a set of items who interacts with each other. How problem domain works w/ solution domain robustness diagrams Robustness diagram is optional. It is the transition from problem domain → solution domain because it starts to speak using design language, not natural English (as in use case) anymore. Robustness diagram is essentially a MVC framework. This is optional in the sense that this is a transition between problem domain to solution domain. Three types of objects: boundary obj ← interface, UI falls in this category → the V entity obj → can result in more domain models → the M control obj → will be translated to helper models, methods → the C One diagram per use case The good thing about robustness diagram is, there is strict rule of what is allowed: Actor can talk only to boundary objects. Boundary objects can talk only to controllers and actors. Entity objects can also talk only to controllers. Controllers can talk to both boundary objects and controllers, but not to actors. sequence diagram This is where the solution domain starts. Sequence diagram represents detailed design. Per use case ← both basic course and alternative course, try to fit them to the same diagram. On the side of sequence, note which use case it is for → traceability. We will end up with a list of classes and methods . allocation methods to class ← design pattern, eg. class factory vs. iterator state diagram Per class from sequence diagram, but cherry pick the important ones ← if it has only two states (on/off), don't bother. Three types of events: entry: do this when you enter this state exit: do this when you leave this state do: do this when you are at this state \"guard\": condition (True/False) Milestones 3 & 4: development and UAT UML doesn't address development. For completeness I'm adding two more milestones here: dev: topics such as test case fall into this place. release: the only thing matters is the UAT , which should come straightly from use cases. Here I also want to highlight the separation between development tool from test tool → programming your solution in Python does not dictate you to test in Python. If you look at the two type of test cases, I think unit test (whitebox) is tightly determined by implementation details → how thorough I traverse code paths (those if-else ). It's often a matter of convenience to write them in the same language because the language itself offers a toolset for the purse, for example, Python's unit test framework. But blackbox cases have not such restriction — performance test can well be done using a tool that has no relevance with Python whatsoever because it only concerns use case which represents requirements ! Therefore, these tests are what UAT is about. The whitebox tests, on the other hand, are for management purpose so you can have control of quality. Now, this separation of purse is not to support that quality is just for the internal use as long as UAT passes. In practice, use cases (= requirements) are simply not possible to address all qualities. Again going back the analogy of requirement being the law you obey in daily life, law often tells you what not to do, but does not tell you what you should do ← you can always live a despicable life but being a lawful citizen at the same time.

You were wearing the black dress, the one you look so refined and elegant in. I reached out to your hand, but you retrieved it inside your sleeve, and only after a couple tries that I was able to hold it in mine. I couldn't tell whether you were happy or not. You were probably reluctant. But, at the moment, I felt so happy. It was like something long lost found, well, it is, a person long lost, found. Then I woke up. 2:30 in the morning. I wanted to text you to tell you that I have a dream of you, again, and it hasn't been there fore a while, and I was really scared that you stopped coming to my dream. Now you are there, again. But, I didn't. It's really a struggle for me whether I should continue to be present in your life, or should disappear altogether so that you could have yours without any concern of me. I always think the latter is better, better for you. But then, what am I to judge what's better or worse? am I playing the God's hand again? I always have this tendency to put myself in a superior position as if I am the wise one that knows what's better. Well, not that I'm being arrogant or over self-confident. I actually feel this way because I care so much, want to make the best of, and wish the best for. And yet, everytime, it comes out in such a negative way, at the receiving end anyway, that I felt discredited, unfair, and disappointed. Why? I can only think that it must be me, the only common denominator in all these cases, that must have something wrong, a low emotion intelligence, a blant attitude, or just arrogance but myself is not seeing it. However, I know I didn't do anything, say anything, with any intention to be misguiding, looking down on ppl, lecturing, prejudicial, let alone lie or manipulative. I will just kill myself I ever fell into the spell of being someone who lie or is dishonest, because I will be disgusted by myself so much I couldn't be live with myself anymore. I miss you. Yes, I do, many many many times. I tried to hide your from my mind, so you could live in a space in me that is not disturbed, quiet, safe, and sweet. Yet, there you are, always stroll out, many times a day, not a word, not a sound, not a smile or a cry, but you are there. I talk to you, somehow, sometimes of things I just did and thought I did it well, so want you to feel proud, to say \"I know you are the best\"; sometimes just sadness, moments I don't feel like seeing anyone else, talking to anyone else, just you, being there, the only one I still have a wish to talk to, about things that saddens me, bothers me. And this dream, feels so real, so real. I don't know whether you felt anything at that moment. Were you sleeping then? Did you hide your hands in your sleeves and didn't want to give it to me? and did you come along to walk by my side? I don't know where you are anymore. It's ok that none of these has been true, it's ok it's a dream that it disappears when I wake up.

I read a line:\"A mind is a terrible thing to waste.\" (looking it up, there is an NPR !) yes I have always remembered this line, because it is so true — despite that I have been losing faith of human being in general, I do consider a mind, well, regardless it is doing good or evil, is a terrible thing to waste. After all, I think the mind is the one only thing that human may come out of his own misery. Reading books always gives me this, false hope maybe, that once a while, just about everything goes into darkness, there is some mind, somewhere, somehow, wired so differently, that sparks a light, that gives, hope. The recent movie of \"Dying to Survive\" is another case in point, that goods came out of something so original, so humble, so remote from being grand, memorable, plausible, beneficial. This feels almost like the argument that free market ppl like to say the best drive to create something good is the individual's extreme selfishness to maximize his/her own gain — it's the root of both good and bad, twins. Well, before I started this article, I was actually going to make a fun of this news I just came across, that \"陕西省社科联经研究决定开展 \"梁家河大学问\"课题研究\", because my first reaction is, what a waste of mind! But then, why wouldn't such nose browning aldo derive something worthwhile? What's the difference between the drive to propose such research versus peddling something legal or illegal just to make money? If we don't understand how these are different, how do I know I don't step over the line someday myself, and wasted the mind I have? I don't have an answer. Somehow I do have a gut feeling that this drive is quite different from just an urge to make money. It is not greed... well, not a greed of $$, but can we say it's a greed of fame? of social capital ? and don't these greed all converge to be a greed of $$ at the end anyway? hmmm... this is worth looking into, how do we categorize greeds!? and what are the inter-links among them? I think the older I get, the clearer I start to realize that these bad words/concepts should not be avoided. Instead, we should look right into its eyes, with fear and uncertainty maybe, but nonetheless, to face it, so you can watch, study, maybe figure out how strong it is really, and start to see a strategy to break it down into smaller tasks so to defeat it, if we really think it's a bad thing to exist. Without further due, here is the 17 research topics: 1.梁家河七年知青岁月在习近平新时代中国特色社会主义思想中的地位、作用研究。 2.梁家河七年知青岁月与\"以人民为中心的发展思想\"的逻辑关系研究。 3.梁家河七年知青岁月与习近平生态文明思想的逻辑关系研究。 4.梁家河七年知青岁月与习近平新时代三产融合思想的逻辑关系研究。 5.梁家河七年知青岁月与习近平新时代脱贫攻坚思想的逻辑关系研究。 6.梁家河七年知青岁月与习近平新时代乡村振兴战略思想的相关研究。 7.梁家河七年知青岁月与习近平新时代基层党建思想的逻辑关系研究。 8.从梁家河七年知青岁月看习仲勋的家风家教相关研究。 9.梁家河精神的科学内涵和时代价值研究。 10.陕西追赶超越中如何汲取梁家河精神养分研究。 11.梁家河的\"大学问\"的科学内涵和时代价值研究。 12.梁家河精神与当代青年的精神塑造研究。 13.延安精神、西迁精神与梁家河精神的比较研究。 14.从梁家河七年知青岁月看改革开放前后中国农村发展变化研究。 15.梁家河\"大学问\"与中华优秀传统文化研究。 16.梁家河\"大学问\"与红色文化基因研究。 17.其他梁家河\"大学问\"相关研究（研究人员可以根据自己研究方向和专长，自拟题目进行研究）。 It's not easy to produce proposals for such a dry topic (IMHO). But well, I have to admire their capability to tolerate the BS, to even think in this BS fashion, internalize this BS, and become thoughtful enough to put such concept together. Wow, I guess theirs minds are probably even smarter than mine. With that endurance and persistence, they could certainly do wonderful things, be successful and all that. And here they are, putting their mind into a study of these topics, certainly the prospective of where to start is totally beyond me. But as a human member, they have demonstrated an incredible character in spending energy and mind on something as arcane, uninteresting (to me at last) as these topics, I have to say, like the twins of greed, this sheds a hope on us ← who knows, somewhere, someone, will use this same character on something, good, and we will all be thankful then. So I think, there isn't a waste of mind, as long as your mind is working on something, and better be something boring, hard, no one likes to bother type. Even by just absorbing yourself into these so you don't let loose your brain power on something truly terrible, like crimes, then you are still doing the society a favor. What a bizzare logic this is!","tags":"thoughts","url":"https://fengxia41103.github.io/myblog/waste%20of%20mind.html"},{"title":"Development","text":"This is a quite fascinating argument, and quite unexpected when I'm reading this book, Mosquitoes, Malaria and Man . As for typing public health efforts to development, WHO takes its stand on popular but treacherous ground. One reason eradication failed, the argument goes, is that governments were not convinced it was worthwhile and were unwilling to push it or pay for it. Malariologists, negelected to bring out cost-benefit models to prove that it may pay more than it costs to keep people healthy. Now it is notoriously difficult to put a value on human life, though many economists are perennially willing to try. But the exercise becomes superficially plausible if you assume that development is the social objective, axiomatically to be considered good, by which other values are tested. Then the worth of a man may be reckoned as what he contributed during a normal life span to the gross national product. If he dies prematurely the years of useful labor cut off are lost and consistute a social cost. If he is by a measurable amount of his assumed potential. And that is economic loss. All these costs may be charged to a malaria if malaria is the villain, along with the direct expenses of treatment, and weighed against the cost of eliminating the disease or reducing it by any given amount. If the model predicts that fighting disease pays, then the exercise can seem as harmless as it ought to seem superfluous. But suppose the fight is found not to pay. As the whole point of running a cost-benefit model is to sway governments presumed to be responsive to that kind of argument, would they not be under as strong pressure to forgo malaria control when the model lights turn red as to proceed when they are green? Unpleasant as is that proffered choice, in the name of economic reason, to buy or not to buy lives, there is still a more unpleasant middle ground: To buy certain lives and sacrifice others . WHO has come perilously close to recommending that governments do just that. As a limited war against malaria by definition cannot extend to the protection of all people, a suggested strategy is to concentrate on protecting those people in society whose economic contributions are most important — workers in key industries, producers of cash crops, those who labor to build roads, dams and other capital improvements, in short all those who are useful for development. This implies a curious and dismaying reversal of values. It used to be argued that development was a good thing because it benefited people; now we seem on the point of agreeing to have blushed at the implication that human life was to be protected only as it contributed to the gross national product. No politician appears to have protested the cynicism thus imputed to political leadership. Everyone is busy being \"realistic.\" If you want to do good in a world so obsessed with development that it allows only two kinds of nation, the developed and the developing, you have to prove that doing good is one way to develop . Failure of the idea of mosquito eradication has in truth left a vacuum. Nations such as India, that came such a long way toward abolishing the ancient malarial scourge, do not want it back; their governments in fact have no real political choice but to continue the fight. Yet the warriors remain disprited, badly in need of fresh purpose. It may be that the most damaging legacy of eradication has been the mental conditioning it fostered. The eradicators developed military minds: The game, they thought, must go to them or to us, win or to be defeated. But there were skeptics of the eradication strategy all along who protested that this was not the real choice in the real world where man habitually copes with recurrent and perennial problems that he can never hope to resolve and put away forever. Protecting ourselves against the malarial plasmodium can be accepted as quite probably a task for all tiime without being daunted by the prospect. Malarial fighters have been a mercurial lot, subject to intense enthusiasms and deep discouragements. Yet their own history should hearten them. Unless The End is finally here, current doldrums are also part of that history, they are therefore interlude not culmination. So in name of development, as it is another \"-ism\", those that do not benefit the course of it will be deemed unworthy. Again, I found emphasis on individual, value and right of an individual, is constantly being challenged, if not at all denied, by these \"in the name of \" beliefs . I recall listening to Jeffery Sachs at BU when he argued that perpetual progress is neither possible nor practical — even if we believe in that universe is inifite, traveling straight towards one direction will only bring us back to where we are. Economy progress and development can not go upwards forever, and I think his point was that it should not, either. Implication is not only that all resources on earth will not be enough to support everyone living like Americans, but this story of malaria highlighted another aspect when things are viewed in a cost-benefit model. Written in 1978, this argument has yet convinced mass to reconsider the path we are on, achievements we yearn for, value of life (as the Chinese have gone through mania of the age of success in the last few years, when preaching of success was the talk of the day), whether we can only go forward, in a forever motion of moving faster, growing bigger, richer. I don't know whether there is a cap of human society, be it in population, in wealth, in resource consumption, in creativity, in imagination, in invention of disaster, in fostering bias and in correction of faults.... In theory I would think there is an upper limit. I'm just living at the tip of its early phase, I suppose. There is a long way to go, I hope.","tags":"thoughts","url":"https://fengxia41103.github.io/myblog/development.html"},{"title":"China witness","text":"I have seen this book on Reader's Corner's shelf for sometime, and never felt I should pick it up and read. The book didn't feel like a kind of book I would like to read, \"Personal interviews!?\" I thought ot myself, \"that is a common cheap method to get some moving and touching feeling to reader while the author/cook puts in nothing much but to collect and compile them.\" That's my thought, like I always look down on those army of real estate agents hovering around a condo complex in China these days ← what they do own/contribute!? anything!? They didn't own the unit, didn't even do much of a homework to collect information of it. As a matter of fact, many of them deliberately present you the wrong information so they can play a scheme on you, like hooking you with a couple interesting one, one too cheap for your budget and one too much over yours, so the strategy predicts that you will then settle on the next one, the mid-range one, that he is actually selling, which he already knew since the very beginning. What the hell. But then, I bought the book, read it, and felt deeply sad inside. Not that those personal stories were interesting, probably remote, to my experience. After all, that's a generation or two of which I had little sense of, heard only some from my own family accounts through dad and uncles, and had always felt distant, almost repulsed to absorb, since that age of darkness was too heavy to think about, too depressing to dig in, and don't we also secretly believe/hope that it is not going to happen again anyway, so might as well not to burden yourself with those information. But then, there was a clip or two, that caught me to think, to feel disturbed, to feel really really sad. I wish there were also hope I felt. But I have to say there was much more sadness than any other emotions. It's not a sadness of a lost love or a lost generation or of their suffering. I can't describe what it is, it is a profound anger, perhaps, now to think of it, and a feeling of sorry for that they had to twisted and turned and made the best out of what they had (or was given) so to survive, yes, just survive, not flourishing, just, survive. Life is hard, for every single generation. There are always one or two the lucky ones, but overall, it is hard. So religion comes into play, so is any kind of thing that gives you comfort so to balance hardship. It's funny that even yesterday when I dropped Noah at a local Chinese church for his first, and mine too, Sunday school, and I was dragged into a newbie session in which a senior member (I guess he is, though I have no clue how the ranking system works in a church) was discussing w/ three of us (two were a couple and the woman works at Lenovo, too!), and her question was, religion is probably needed because people need something to help go through life's hardtime → a psychological need. On the one hand, I think everybody would just agree w/ her point, because this is such a universal ask. On the other hand, I also feel seeking it is then a challenge, if not a impossibility, because there are so many to choose from (and doesn't each one clams they are the true one, while others are just plain false!?), but without a reference, how can one choose? Oh well. I'll leave this to another discussion later. Here, I want to jog down a few sections from this book, which, while reading them, gave me a moment of, silence. Page 199, \"Tea houses and news singers\" Sitting opposite Old Mr Wu, the \"written complaint\" he had paid someone to write on his behalf clutched in my hands, my heart ached. These peasants who thought that young Westerners in fashionable \"begging jeans\" were poor, and that doing hard, ill-regarded labour in the city was to \"enjoy life and make big money\", did not even have the basic information or understanding they needed to live in the same era. But they had never made demands for a better life ot the rich and powerful who requsitioned them into bankruptcy. Yet those \"mother and father officials\" who have survived until today only because the peasants kept to their work instead of throwing down their hoes to make revolution and class struggle apparently never paused in their daily banquets to consider the price the peasants have paid with their blook and sweat. China's peasants have been treated as a part of the 10,000 things of nature, a group that nobody notices. People are concerned about the melting of the ice caps, they fret over the disappearance of the Asian tigers, they fume at the desert swallowing up the green lands, they even have interminable discussions over the right combination of vitamins ofr every dish of food. But how man people are calling out for an improvement in the living conditions of the Chinese peasants? How many people pause to consider the bowls of weak vegetable soup in China's poverty-stricken villages, with just a few grains of rice added to stave off hunger? How many people would go to read a story like \"The Gourd Children\" or \"The Monkey King\" to the children of poor farmers who don't even know which end to open a book at or where to start reading from on the page, so that those hearts, whose first awareness was of days and nights of hunger, cold and disease, can have their share of goals and beautiful memories like the rest of us? How many people realise that helping those poverty-stricken, uneducated peasants begins with wresting power from local officials who in turn have no education and simply do not understand the law? China has become strong, China has stood up, but we cannot stand on the shoulders of the peasants for the world to admire how tall we are. We cannot let the peasants' blood and sweat water the tree of our national pride. Page 411 — Train from Nanjing to Shanghai, 7 May 2007: GIRL A: How do you know that your dad has a lover?

CLEANER: Yes, all of them, even the new ones they've just hung up. It's just that one over the soap dispenser, there's a mark on the man's face, I can't get it off. MANAGER: Don't you srub that off, I put that tape over the man's eyes myself. Whatever were they were thinking of, hanging a picture of a man in a ladies' toilet? How come the floor in that cubicle isn't shiny? CLEANER: I've just mopped it. MANAGER: Not hard enough, you should mop the floor until you can see the face of the person in the next toilet!

YOUNG WOMAN: That brand's too old-fashioned — as soon as the boss sees it he'll know that I'm behind the times. YOUNG MAN: Things are really expansive here, and money's tight for me this month. YOUNG WOMAN: So do you really love me? YOUNG MAN: Of course I love you! YOUNG WOMAN: Do you? Then you couldn't let me show up in the clothes that aren't even brand names and lose face in front of a foreign boss, now, could you? Page 417 Closing paragraphs. These voices mostly come from the younger generation, I guess, because most of their parents and grandparents don't know how to use a computer — they are a generation who know, instead, of civil war, political madness, and queuing for food. In seeing those young Chinese united in such a way, in their care, their outrage and national pride, I realise I may be wrong about them. I used to think that they were too comfortable and too rich to understand China's hungry past, or those poor, uneducated peasants and the misunderstood last generations. All of this made me think of that song \"Dyed with my Blood\", again: why does the national flag have to be painted with Chinese blood? I pray for my motherland — I hope there will be peasce and strength, rooted in love and happy families, and with friends around the world.","tags":"thoughts","url":"https://fengxia41103.github.io/myblog/china%20witness.html"},{"title":"Generalization","text":"I have been thinking, is generalization good, or bad, or inevitable? I kinda of wonder that looking at something, especially something new, in a generalized term, is actually inevitable. Watching Noah learning things since young, he has to generalize things in order to recognize anything — this is a dog, that is a cat. Over the weekend I got a few mosquito bites which annoyed me to hell. Then I was thinking about the book I picked up last week, something about the history of Malaria, which to many runs that mosquito is spreading virus, thus if we could eliminate mosquito entirely (as a specie), then we are good. Well, then I was thinking, among that gazillion mosquitoes, are we now just viewing ALL of them as a single identity, a unified blob of living thing with a set of common traits, and how many of us have any idea how many mosquitoes out there!? I bet there are many. Then, how many among them are actually the cause Malaria? I don't know. I challenge anyone around me knows that. Then, we human being view ALL of them an enemy in a bio warfare, and targeting to kill them all (at least on a conceptual level. I think the biologist who are developing human side of the weaponry actually do have some idea of which type of mosquito is good & which is bad.) S case in point, this is exactly we can comprehend things, anything, because our capacity simply can not incorporate all the details in order to track and distinguish at an individual level. Therefore, the only way to build a \"knowledge\" (quote on purpose) is to generalize. This same is happening actually in my work. When I'm proud of building a data model through analysis, I always thought in term of attributes so that a set of attributes become a representation of a thing — a car, a user, a server. These are data models, and they are abstracts which approximate the real thing, but will never be as real as the real thing, because we know from the beginning that we are not going to, and simply can not (and I mean this not because we are lazy, but we do NOT have the tool — language, syntax, methodology, to describe them in an OVERALL fashion! Honestly, I don't know what such a description will look like in my wildest dream! It's just beyond me at this moment!) include all details and possibilities. Thus, a model is, as I have always said, a personal view, an opinion if you will, of this thing — I many abstract a car into a shell, 4 wheels, a steering wheel, and so forth; but we all know that first of all, kids always don't view car in such a way at the beginning (eventually they conform w/ our views, but that's completely drilled into their head by us, not their organic view). And secondly, this exactly abstract of a car becomes a force our imagination has to battle in order to think outside the box ! Why does car have to have 4 wheels? or wheels at all?... a dominant view becomes a convention, a convention becomes a rule, a rule becomes both a guide that has proven to work, and a cat who constantly patrolls its territory looking for intrusion to fight off ← this isn't inspired by some dark human nature. This is logic, and I can see this logic has played in the past, is playing now, and will play again and again and again, in different forms and spaces and contexts, but the same logic, over and over. But then, such abstract, which = learning = knowledge, is really problematic, and this is tightly related to technology. NPR talks about policy uses profiling (based on data analysis) to identify candidates to monitor, who essentially is said (by algorithm!) to have higher probability to commit a crime. Well, this is easily understood, from both a conventional wisdom point of view and a data analysis POV. What comes into the play is the word history (or track record ) → if you have done wrong in the past, you may have a certain traits stronger than other people's, and these traits are more likely to get you in a situation that law defines as a crime ← a quick temper, a violent history, or even single-parent family background, low-education, drug taking, and so on and so forth. Actually most people will agree that such statistics do support these claims. But if so, what about individual!? what about having opportunity to correct what was wrong? what about not discriminating somebody by just putting on a label? I mean, how do we know we have stamped a label too liberally that it has not becomes a bias against somebody without a cause or foundation? But then, without using a label, how do we learn!? The entire so called science and technology is built upon this method of abstraction. This is how we can ever simplify the world in a way so that we can study and comprehend. Otherwise, it will the Go game or any of the so-called ancient Chinese art form, martial art included, that we have to count on some odd historical genius to advance it, because its value lies in its entire format , so it can not be broken down, be analytically deciphered, thus hard to teach and to share knowledge, and impossible to replicate. I think human is caught in a dilemma. I don't believe there is solution. Therefore, the struggle between abstracting into a common theme versus calling to treat individual equally will continue to exist without a solution. This then gives a perfect excuse (if they are actually smart because they consciously manipulated this leverage to their advantage) or just plainly a side-effect, that discrimination based on race, gender, education, family tie, whatever (and these are just labels!), is truly an inherited consequence of the nature of human recognition. If we think they are evil deeds (which I believe they are), we have to watch ourselves, and remind ourselves how we have created them in the first place, like creating a child, you can't just walk away → you can be irresponsible by not raising her, but the biological bond is forever true, and you can't deny it. But when I look at my mosquito bites, I still don't them at all, in a most general way, with a most general label → and if I cannot overcome this, how would I know I won't apply this same flaw on other things, things that can cause harm to other human, friend or foe!? As a member of human, I feel powerless.","tags":"thoughts","url":"https://fengxia41103.github.io/myblog/generalization.html"},{"title":"Server RAID","text":"If you are like me who dislikes any GUI and mouse clicks, CLI via a SSH session to IMM is a fun way to get things done.

Infrastructure needs to be managed, but then, what does it mean? Borrowing from wiki, a view can be: Asset Management Network connectivity Management Environment Management Energy Management Change Management and Capacity Management Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD) Integration[17] This type of view is based on an attribute of object that we are managing — serial number is logged in asset management, utilization is likely in energy management, and how full the rack is falls in capacity management, and so on. View of attributes However, I think such a view is inadequate because it artificially break an attribute into multiple systems, thus creating a boundary and possibility that the same attribute may not present, or not defined in an agree-ed way, thus its data and meaning becomes a conflict rather than an added-value. The situation becomes even worse when certain aspect of this attribute is a moving target, eg. interface changes a name, or VLAN gets re-named. Are these networking management? or asset management? To give an example: what does it mean when a server is under management ? First is to inventory (model, serial #, components...). But this is certainly not sufficient. What's the state of it? (firmware version, BIOS settings). Then, reading these and display them leads to the next step -- can we update them? Now this is LXCA and its alternatives. But this leads to more, because server state is meaningful only to whoever is using it (workloads).... on top of these, a deployment involving multiple servers will have a shutdown or bootup sequence which may call for a specific order because of data dependency ← don't shutdown storage server before all its writers have been turned off. Therefore, managing a server will inevitably involve multiple attributes at the same time, thus it must be a vertical view that cuts through all the services mentioned above. In other words, previously we extract a list of attributes from an object and build a system based on commonality of their meaning, eg. we put all serial numbers into a system called \"asset management\", all fan speed and heat assumption into a \"energy management\" system, and so on. But such approach will always result in overlapping presentation of the same object in multiple domains, which then leads to a turf war that each fights over whose reference is more true than others . A band-aid concept then is brought up to build a MDM , a place where all different references are reconcilled so to have a consistency and authority. But then, any secondary presentation of a data leads to a load of questions such as data synchronization, data integrity, and whether MDM is a receiver of first-line system, or the source for them? It should not be that way. A capability model Instead, I am proposing a different approach. Take any attribute you would like to management , I would define its management using a model of five levels of capabilities (see below). The higher the level of capability we implement, the more control we have over that attribute, and having control is just another term for management. Five levels of capabilities level 1: inventory This is capability of bookkeeping, such as an inventory of hardware as seen in vanilla netbox. The distinguished character of data is that they are static — serial number, UUID, and the like. Some data are changed over time, such as rack position, but the frequency of its change justifies it to be fully capable of a manual update. Acceptable strategy: manual, or import auto ← discovery confluent level 2: reality, and/or, design These two go hand-in-hand, and I'll explain why so. Reality is referring to a form of passive read to collect information — meta of a system, network traffic, interface name, power state, host name, MAC address. It provides data to form a view of what we actually have . Remember, in a machine world, if it can read once, it can read continuously for many many times. If one can describe a reality, the same syntax shall be able to describe also a design — an expectation of what we want to have. In any software-defined scheme, we can easily relate to a set of configuration values as the design, while their effects represent the reality — I want to set host name to be \"xyz\", well, so what is its name as of this moment? or in a programming language context, reality is the get while design is the set . But one curious thing of this level is that these two capabilities are not both required! You can have a way to read reality, but may have no way to match it to a design. For example, logdash , is a reality tool, not a design tool. Then there is Visio, PPT, Word, that you can write all about your design, and they will not do anything to convert your text to a line of code or a configured system. Acceptable strategy: For monitoring, auto ONLY (manual is meaningless). level 3: diff Diff = reality - design . If you have ever been in a brainstorm session of new idea, this is what got most people execited about, because it quickly leads to: customer configurable threshold, and alerts . Now everybody is picturing a buzzing text message, or at least an email, to alert an admin in the middle of a night when a diff exceeds a threshold ← it feels empowering, intelligent, and machine like. But this is a lot harder than many would like to believe. The challenge lies in the detail of the design ← what consists of your design? what are the indexes? values? definition of done? Few people are good at describing what they want in an upfront fashion. Often enough it becomes a guess game, while either both parties enjoy, or one gets completly annoyed and frustrated. You: I want to buy a ticket. Agent: where are you going? You: Raleigh, NC. Agent: here it is. You: But it's no good. Agent: What do you mean? You: It's not a United Airline flight. Agent: Oh, np. Here is a UA ticket. You: No good. Agent: Why? You: It's a morning flight! Agent: What would you prefer? ..... Challenge is in the hand of designer — how well can s/he list out a list of preferences, and how important they are... if you have written software requirements, you know most, if not all projects, die right here. Acceptable strategy: auto (manual is meaningless). level 4: design → reality As soon as one can monitor and validate (level 3 capabilities), the next logical step is to make design into reality . This at least takes care of Day 0 deployment. It requires: a syntax to describe design, a tool to convert it into executable instructions, a monitoring service/agent to read where we are a validation/diff to know how far are we from destination To user, this is what they will call a state — they give you a wish list, and you are the genie in a bottle. Acceptable strategy: paper instruction some level of automation many orchestration tools all claim to achieve this with zero pains. level 5: diff → design If level 4 gets your design to a reality on day 1, then system will inevitably drift and diff from design over time. Alert is nice, but self-correction is better. Different from design → reality, diff is essentially a moving target. Unlike design which is a static set of expectations, diff can expose a value on one has thought about. Thus a capability to bring diff back into designed state is a challenge. Acceptable strategy: Full re-build: wipe it clean and re-build as if new. Incremental correction. Hybrid: this is the hardest one, also the most likely approach, because it involves a decision of when we should just wipe it clean and rebuild, and when a correction is preferred. An exercise Let's try it with managing a server. Example: netbox device model Filling a value to each and every attribute field does not make the server managed . Instead, we should examine one attribute at a time. Take primary_ip4 attribute for example: level 1: can we document/inventory its value? level 2: reality: can we discover IP and match it with a server? design: can we define an IP for a server before this IP actually exists? level 3: can we audit and sound an alarm if there is a diff? level 4: can we command this server to obtain a pre-defined IP? level 5: if diff is detected, can we do sonmething to re-obtain the original IP besides sounding an alarm? In Netbox, this capability stops at level 1. It can inventory, but has no discovery capability, no design capability, thus having no level 3-5 capabilities either. Therefore, the IP attribute of a server in Netbox is managed at Level 1, if that satisfies your requirement. Conclusion There is no silver bullet. View, framework, paradigm, these are just convenient words, labels, jargons, or BS-es. Attribute is often real and concrete — a rack position, a serial number; but its management is ambiguous. However, following a vertical view in term of these capabilities, we can at least create five placeholders for each and every, thing, that you want to call to manage, and ask to fill these blanks before claiming it is managed just because it is in a \"management system\". My 2 cents.","tags":"thoughts","url":"https://fengxia41103.github.io/myblog/capability%20model.html"},{"title":"Lights","text":"Walking out from a shadow after a morning gym session, my eyes were blinded, for a while, as if I was walking across a border between two worlds, a new life? a re-birth?

Sunset, the lights came through the corridor like a special lighting effect. Noah was absorbed in his silly word game and his back was facing the door, so he couldn't see the lights, but it was there, for me, to experience this moment of quietness, family-ness, just he and I, and he was in a good mood, laughing at my silly jokes as if I were the best comedian, and he picked it up with his own silly twist, and went on to invent a whole series of words that were completely new, completely silly, but he enjoyed them very much. And I so wished you were there, if the three of us, to be there, just like the last morning we went for breakfast, and you and Noah went off to get him a cake, when you walked to me, leading Noah's hand, I could only wish the time to stop, stop, stop. There were nothing more I could want, nothing more I would wish, nothing more. Don't know where you are now. Walking in this world becomes dull. Lights shined on me, made me to close eyes for a while. Like waking up from a dream, suddenly, wake up, look around, you have gone, nowhere to be found.

Send en\\n to put this login session into a superuser mode. I think this is optional because the login user may already be configured to be a super user. For Enos, Send no console\\n to turn off alerts. This is important . Otherwise switch will throw at you all kinds of messages, such as topology changed, detected logged in from IP (actually that's you!). Anyway, just a best practice. I have to say that after so many tries, there isn't a reliable way to handle login session with confidence. MAC table Commands to use: ENOS: show mac CNOS: display mac address-table MAC table is saying: I see this MAC on VLAN on port # . MAC address table is the core of a switch — all the MACs it has learned by seeing it from a traffic. These MACs, however, are not necessarily from a device you know of! For example, a traffic from some external device flowing through this switch will certainly show up in this table with its MAC, but we have no way to derive information of the device who owns this MAC (a switch? a server? a router?). Further, MAC table changes ALL THE TIME. It is built up from traffic, thus its contents only reflects what this switch has seen (based on its update algorithm). We use it as a exhaustive list (everything this switch knows of), and relying to match with other meta, eg. I found this MAC to be an interface in this server, to connect the dots. This is the key of constructing a reality view of a physical topology . So from a traffic, we can capture: MAC of the source. Again, we know the MAC, but don't know who owns it. VLAN id. Port number.

Switch-to-switch links (we are talking about physical cable connections from A port to B port) can be pulled from a switch ← they refer to devices connected to a switch neighbors .

In trunk mode, you can then set allowed vlans ; in access mode, this port allows only ONE vlan, and that is its native vlan (see next). native vlan : also called untagged vlan (in Netbox, for example) allowed vlans : this is a list of VLAN ids that can flow through this port. In order to set this, mode must be in trunk mode. ENOS To set configs in trunk mode: en <-- enable admin mode config terminal <-- to enter config mode interface port <port id> <-- to select the port to config switchport mode trunk switchport trunk allow vlan < 1 ,2,3...> switchport trunk native vlan <vlan id> Note : you must set the native vlan last, and also must be sure that native vlan id is also part of the allowed vlans. For example, if we are to set native vlan to 1, and current allowed is \"2,3,4,5\", it will fail because 1 is not part of \"2,3,4,5\". Instead, you should set allowed to \"1,2,3,4,5\" first, then set native to 1. To set in access mode → allowed vlan is applicable anymore! en config terminal interface port <port id> swithport mode access switchport access vlan <vlan id> check port config Use show interface port <port id> .

Note that this will succeed if you have removed ISL key first! Then on each switch: set to the same vlag tier-id <id> . set vlag isl adminkey <key> .

In ENOS world, it's called PortChannel (in CNOS it's called port-aggregation , see section next). See manual page 178. Remove existing portchannel: no portchannel <id> Select interface: interface port <id> Setup each port that will be inlcuded in this bind. According to manual , all ports must have identical settings. This makes sense: mode: switchport mode trunk ← I think it must be trunk allowed vlans: switchport trunk allow vlan <1,2,3,4..> native vlan: switchport trunk native vlan <id> Add to bind: portchannel <channel id> port <port list 1,2,3,4> Enable: portchannel <channel id> enable CNOS Link two ports on the same switch It's called aggregation-group (see manual ). First, create and setup an aggregation-group (note that CLI uses port-aggregation !): Create aggregation group: interface port-aggregation <1-4096> . Set this LAG port to trunk mode: bridge-port mode trunk . Assign allowed vlans: bridge-port trunk allowed vlan <comma delimiter list> , eg. 1-19,100-109,3999 . exit ← so you can select other things to config. Second, set up the port you want to add to this aggregation: Select port to config: interface ethernet 1/<port> , eg. 1/17 to select port #17. Set port in trunk mode: bridge-port mode trunk Remove native vlan from port: no bridge-port trunk native vlan ← this is super important. Otherwise, aggregation-group <id> mode on will complain of MISMATCH VLAN . Assign proper list of allowed vlans: bridge-port trunk allow vlan ... ← use the same VLAN list as above!

But we need more. Managing a lab or a rack is more than level 1. On top of all these, we talk about automation, which implies capabilities at least to level 4. Therefore, we used Netbox code as a starting point, and built a POC. Background It has been a painful experience to witness how we are diagnosing infrastructure, especially network connections, in a what I would call chasing the rabbit fashion in which ping , route , vlan , port on a switch, to which port the two ends of a cable plugged into, all coming to a single chain of a valid connection. Part of it is to verify hardware connections (cablings), part of software configurations (many layers deep). A knowledgeable person can traverse the link from one end to the other, but even he is faced with a harsh reality of which area is to focus on. If you think of it in the highest level — a topology design, its mirror image is the reality. Scanning devices to acquire and compose the reality is what computer is good at. Therefore, like counting inventory, it shall have the capability to replace the typing of repetitive commands by a human hand, and piece-meal ocean of meta data into a logical, meaningful view that saves operator mechanical efforts. Without knowing the design, at least it should produce, and even maintain, the reality view, on demand and continuously. Taking this further, if reality can be described, the same syntax shall be used to describe expectation (design). Now, we will be equiped with both views and produce a diff → Previously we are relying on an experienced operator to know where to look; in the future this diff view highlights it, color-codes it, for anyone who wants to look, anytime, and no devop expertise required. If you have read system capability model , you must have identified that this is a capability approach. This shifts the focus of management from bookkeeping to knowledge automation. The goal is not to eliminate human factor, but to alleviate waste of their bandwidth on things that can be well known, well modeled, and scriptable. Analysis requires intelligence; SSH to ten machines does not. There are essentially two type of models: logical and physical. Logic models are logical relationships, eg. device → tenant. Tenant is nothing but a logical concept. Physical models are describing a relationship that requires a physical connection, eg. an interface is connected to a switch port (via a cable). Device The center piece of Netbox models is the Device , representing a physical device such as server and switch. This makes sense as the primary physical asset of a data center are certainly these devices. Example list of devices Device role DeviceRole is a user-defined value list that can be assigned to a device. Its common use is to group device by its function, such as what we see above — \"Management Switch\", \"Ceph\". A device role also defines a color, thus making a color-coded presentation of a list of devices possible. Device type DeviceType describes attributes such as manufacturer and model. There are two important flags that will affect how a device can be used: is a network device ? ← if not, the device will not have an interface → therefore, it will not be able to link to an IP! can have child device ? → if not, it will not have bay device (we model BMC controller as a bay device inside a server). Example list of device types Access a device How to access a device? In bare essence we need three things: (IP, username, password) (we will explain Netbox's way to control password in a later section). Further, we use platform value to determine access method: linux : SSH Lenovo ENOS/CNOS : these are Lenovo switch operating systems, and access method is Telnet (see Network switch for details.) Device IP & credential. A device can have multiple IP address but only one primary IP4 & IP6. It can also have multiple credentials. We are using credential type \"Nanagement\" to highlight the one to use. Interface & topology A device whose device type sets is_network_device=True can be linked to an Interface , and an interface can be linked to an IP address. Device interfaces An InterfaceConnection linking two interfaces is the corner stone to describe a network topology: CONNECTION_STATUS_PLANNED = False CONNECTION_STATUS_CONNECTED = True CONNECTION_STATUS_CHOICES = [ [ CONNECTION_STATUS_PLANNED , 'Planned' ], [ CONNECTION_STATUS_CONNECTED , 'Connected' ], ] class InterfaceConnection ( models . Model ): \"\"\" An InterfaceConnection represents a symmetrical, one-to-one connection between two Interfaces. There is no significant difference between the interface_a and interface_b fields. \"\"\" interface_a = models . ForeignKey ( 'Interface' , related_name = 'connected_as_a' , on_delete = models . CASCADE ) interface_b = models . ForeignKey ( 'Interface' , related_name = 'connected_as_b' , on_delete = models . CASCADE ) connection_status = models . BooleanField ( choices = CONNECTION_STATUS_CHOICES , default = CONNECTION_STATUS_CONNECTED , verbose_name = 'Status' ) In the example topology diagram below, we see: Connect between port #34 of a switch ( LCTC-R1U39-SW ) to a BMC interface ( ceph-1 is the BMC controller's name). A server ( ceph-node-brain2 ) has two interfaces — eno1 and ens4f1 , where: eno1 is connected to port 2 of a switch ( R1U39 ), and ens4f1 is connected to port 18 of another switch ( R1U37 ). Example device view of a topology Children device ( DeviceBay ) A device can have device bays, which essentially forms a parent-children relationship. One use case of this relationship is to register BMC controller as a bay device inside a server: Device bay Conditions to form a parent-child relationship: parent device allows bay/child (defined in DeviceType ) one can not install into itself Related device Related devices is defined as devices that: belong to the same site and has the same device role In Netbox this is only a convenience for navigation. However we can extend this idea using other definitions. Related devices Grouping Just how many ways one can group devices? Maybe too many. Note that there are overlapping groups which are very confusing! Rack can also be grouped by Site . Both rack and site can be grouped by Tenant . device_type = models . ForeignKey ( 'DeviceType' , related_name = 'instances' , on_delete = models . PROTECT ) device_role = models . ForeignKey ( 'DeviceRole' , related_name = 'devices' , on_delete = models . PROTECT ) tenant = models . ForeignKey ( \"tenancy.Tenant\" , blank = True , null = True , related_name = 'devices' , on_delete = models . PROTECT ) platform = models . ForeignKey ( 'Platform' , related_name = 'devices' , blank = True , null = True , on_delete = models . SET_NULL ) site = models . ForeignKey ( 'Site' , related_name = 'devices' , on_delete = models . PROTECT ) rack = models . ForeignKey ( 'Rack' , related_name = 'devices' , blank = True , null = True , on_delete = models . PROTECT ) Rack Rack is the physical grouping of devices. The most important thing about rack is whether it has availabe space to contain a device : rack height how much have been reserved ( RackReservation )? what devices does it already have? what are their height and depth? Depth comes to play because some devices can be half-depth, thus allowing two devices in the same slot — one facing the front, and one facing the back. Also, it is common that top-of-rack switch is mounted facing back so that cables can access its port. Example of a rack There are four ways to group racks: site = models . ForeignKey ( 'Site' , related_name = 'racks' , on_delete = models . PROTECT ) group = models . ForeignKey ( 'RackGroup' , related_name = 'racks' , blank = True , null = True , on_delete = models . SET_NULL ) tenant = models . ForeignKey ( Tenant , blank = True , null = True , related_name = 'racks' , on_delete = models . PROTECT ) role = models . ForeignKey ( 'RackRole' , related_name = 'racks' , blank = True , null = True , on_delete = models . PROTECT )","tags":"dev","url":"https://fengxia41103.github.io/myblog/netbox.html"},{"title":"Moment of quietness","text":"It's quiet here. Office is deserted due to the upcoming long weekend. It feels rather strange. Listening to the song makes me to think of you, and the days agains. Mr.Makato is still here. He is always here early in the morning, and leave late at night. Is he is alone? Doesn't he ever go home? Does he have a home? I want to see you. This moment of quietness. A scene came to my mind, that years later when I was still thinking of you, and my kids look at me and you, and could not figure out what is soo good about you, like when we look at others' love, you wonder what's so special of that person to make him/her so hooked to it. For outsiders, it always looks unlikely , but for people who are the subjective, s/he can't help it. So that's how I am feeling. I can't help it. Was ready to go home, to pick up Noah early so we can spend some time together. I can already see his smile if I tell him we can play computer game together. What a wonderful age! He is so easily entertained, satisfied, and find so many things, happy, genuinely happy. When did I lose these on the way to now? I may still have some, but not a lot left, and is becoming less and less. How sad. I always think there is a song for any couple, either as boyfriend girlfriend, or just a one-night-stand. Whatever, there is a song, that describes the mood, the scene, the feel, the touch, the emotion when two eyes first met, when two hands first touch, when two bodies first unite, for the two hearts first soften and melt. Love is wonderful. I can't think of anything else in life so far that gives you more of a sensation than when you are in love. I think women are indeed wiser than men ← women recognize this long ago before a man grows to his maturity and start to realize how wonderful a relationship he has/had. Sometimes I try to picture that song. There is one you sent me. I like it. I thought it is the one. But sometimes I felt otherwise. This, the one I'm listening, feels more like how I feel. Then there are other songs, that bring back other memories, feelings, people in the past, or life in the past, pain or happiness ← you know, regardless what they are, they are always part of you, just like any food you eat, will eventually become part of you, and any book you read, shapes your mind, even just a tiny bit, will now inseparable. 蒋方舟 said \"dating with someone is like a ghost story, because you see the reflections of all his/her previous relationships\". How true. So sometimes I feel I shouldn't have let you go, because the process is what matters; but still, everytime I start to miss you, I remind myself how I could have faced otherwise when I'm getting too old for you, and you have such a full life ahead! No I can't, I can't do this to you. You are free, and should be free. Live a life as it will give you, I don't know how good or bad it can be. Forever I wanted to be next to you so to make sure you are protected, cherished. I will do that, as a shadow perhaps, so when you fall, ever, that's when you will feel me again, down below, to catch you. Bless. Sweet dream, 遥远的，美丽的，不再有音信的，你.","tags":"thoughts","url":"https://fengxia41103.github.io/myblog/moment%20of%20quietness.html"},{"title":"Must do, maybe","text":"I just had a thought — many mid-age women claim that they feel the best of themselves in this age band because they are independent, self-sufficient, less anxious, not that they have fewer troubles in life, but they view them as a matter-of-fact, just deal with it when it comes. On one hand, the cliche is always that mid-age is a tough time because we have fewer choices now than when we were young, but much more obligation/responsibilities to fulfill, family, kids, parents, and so on. Therefore there are many of the \"I have to\" scenarios, part of it that it becomes a convenient execuse to do the things you want and to dodge the things you don't like; on the other hand they do feel that you have to do them because you are aware that alternatives (not like before that you simply don't know what the alternative path can lead to, thus were feeling hopeful because you didn't know better), if any, is not that pretty and easy either. So might as well force through on this same path, of which at least you know some about. So there is marriage that people hold on to, not that they like it, but they feel they have to (until another perfect candidate shows up in hour life), the job you have to go to everyday (and all jobs are not fun and easy, and mingle with a new team, new environment, essentially a new social group, is not only very tiring, but quite scary.)..... So literature, talks, movies, TVs, all depict a mid-life crisis when these inevitable tasks crash on you, probably in a blow-up fashion (when all the misfortunes happen at once), and honestly, the blow-up fashion is the probably the only possible fashion this will play out, because the original so called \"balance\" is so fragile that any deviation will cause it to → CRASH! So we keep tittering by the edge of a cliff, trying not to look down, not to fall, to fool the mind that the cliff does not exist, to look for even a grass to grab, thinking that at least it will create some resistance when gravity kicks in ← maybe it will slow down the fall? maybe it is just strong enough to hold me?.... in sum, we want a sense of security, but it feels like an impossible goal. But then, why women in their 40s feel so good about themselves? and even for myself, I feel so much, more sure about myself than ever, not because of the skills I have or the job or the status. I mean, if measured by any of these dimensions I'm an absolute loser in any common sense and categories. No. I started to feel \"sure\" about myself because now I'm angrier these day, which then translate to that I constantly feel that I don't care much about the surroundings, other people's views or opinions, anymore. Noah, like me, is keenly sensitive of people around, and gets influenced easily. Siqi, probably the same, when she said she is a like a mirror merely reflecting the people around her. I wonder this is an attribute of smartness ← because you are smart, your mind is that much perceptive to things and people, so you, if viewed as a machine, acquires a much greater amount of information that it feeds your powerful brain to process to keep it busy, then in return you feel more, know more, think more, thun wiser and smarter, than those who don't — a perfect, positive, feedback loop! So when I don't pay attention to others anymore, does it then make me dumb, in the end, because I cut off the feedback loop now? Actually I would say no. Sometimes I feel I'm simply turning inward more, so I still sense these things, think/process, but it becomes an entertainment for myself, a show without an audience, versus when I was younger the best time is when there is an audience who applauds. No, audience is not needed anymore. I think that makes a difference. This leads to that since I don't seek for approval by others, things you do, or not do, becomes solely your own decision — you do it because you enjoy some part of it, no one forces you to. Alternatives are many. The reason you didn't take them is not that you have to do this one, but you have made a choice for yourself. And even for alternatives, I sometimes think I know too many alternatives, which makes choice difficult (aren't we all fear the cost of opportunity?). If only God has laid one path in front of you, and you have no choice but this one! For young folks, alternatives were few, due mostly to their limited life experience (at one point I firmly believed that going to college, getting married, having a kid, is THE ONLY GOOD PATH I should take). As many of them look quite promising, because, they seem to solve the current problem. Well, they might do solve your problem, but they also come with theirs, just different ones, and devils are in the details, they only look easier than what you have because, you haven't been there yet. Once you take a few steps on that alternative path, boy, isn't this one hard! So this is what life has taught me — there is no silver bullet. Everything comes with a set of good things and bad things. Making decision or choosing alternative is simply swapping one set of these goods and bads with another. No difference (well, there is I have to say, because Siqi is such a wonderful, beautiful, person, of mind & soul.) Therefore, I feel relieved at this age, that there isn't anything I have to . No. There are many I can choose from, because it's all about whether I'm willing to take that path or not. I think this explains why these 40ish women feel relieved, and I think it's the right feeling to have. We in our 40s have less possibilities, but abundant alternatives. What's lacking is will, but that's not an age thing. It's more of a personal attribute, some have it, some don't. It can be labled as risk taking, or being conservative, or being a responsible, or just being satisfied with what you have (what-is-happiness kind of talk).... whatever it is called, I want to make it clear, that it's a decision you are making, there is no \"I have to\", there is only \"I do\" .","tags":"thoughts","url":"https://fengxia41103.github.io/myblog/must%20do.html"},{"title":"How many can one love","text":"Train is an interesting, amazing thing. Never thought I will be sitting on a train (CalTrain) which brought me a feeling of riding train in China. I haven't expected to see your messages, because I think it is the right thing to do that I should disappear from your life entirely. Watching a movie the other night, a line struck me — a woman said she hates a man, that she is now 39, and have not married. I don't want you to be like that. I want you to move on your life, because you have so much ahead of you. Don't waste time with me. Don't. Everyone has a life to live, live yours, experience yours. I feel like a parent who is watching over his child, knowing all too well what is ahead of him, yet have to refrain from directing his life — if it were a fall, I could only be there when he falls, and pull him out if I am able to. So that's how I feel, watching the Californian sun zooming by my window. Out there, it is a crowded town with homes, cars, trees, grasses, mountain at remote background. But they are just passing by; you, stayed. Walking on the street the other night, I was thinking to myself, just how many women I have fallen in love with in my life? Surprisingly, there have been quite a few. So what does it mean? Does it mean that human, or male, is capable of (or rather, instintly will) loving quite a few? Each episode was real. I tried to think which one is the one I _love the most , the one who left a dent on my soul, whereas others who have been loved, but moved on? Sometime I picture lying in death bed, which one of them I would want to see the most, the one whom I want to know she is doing well, will be ok, and regretfully I now have to leave first? Each breakup was a tough one. They all felt the end of the world. I know some have now faded in memory whose name and smile hardly pass through my mind anymore. Then there are one and two, whose voice and figure linger on, peeked from deep inside as often as they have always been, fresh, close, vivid, real. So, how many can one love in a life? many, perhaps. Then there is one, whose shadow takes over all of them. Is she the true love? or just a wound never closed? or, perhaps, as perfect as a love, can be?","tags":"thoughts","url":"https://fengxia41103.github.io/myblog/how%20many%20can%20one%20love.html"},{"title":"Technology and society","text":"I have been thinking quite a bit about technology, and its relationship to society. I used to be a firm believer, and a practitioner, of technology. After all, it is what I do, and I actually enjoying writing code and drawing diagrams to analyze a problem at hand and to illustrate my thinkings. government knows more than we have imagined However, while reading the book \"Short history the Chinese Communism\" , I got a really deep impression that government, after all, is not as ignorant, as I, or many others, have imaged. This book, written in 1970s, has a quite good understanding of CCP's historical events, its path till the writing, its organization, its agenda, and its main players and who they are and what they do and have done. What makes it even more impressive is that data are collected from official channels, eg. gov publishing, party journals, which, in my previouly biased opinion, is so crooked and abused that nothing is worth noticing, let alone quoting. But author has made a clear case out of these, and have illustrated cleared and nicely how the party has formulated its strategies to get where it is. It certainly had a critical tone on many of the policies, especially it had zero illusion of its propaganda and the political objective these tools were used to achieve. Towards the mid reading, I could almost picture myself being a party chief or a country lead who thinks not of picture of individual's life, but an impact on a mass scale that effects will be counted in generations, and trial-and-error in lights of its being beneficial or necessary for many while some, well there will always be some edges cases don't you think?, who will lose and suffer — so it's life, so it's always the case, so if the number is small enough and I could sleep well without losing conscience, this will the price to pay. Too bad. This feeling scares me! I start to understand how these people sitting on the top of a country/county/province will reason on a policy/decision. The impact is too remote, and their life are isolated from it so they are essentially operating a joy stick of a war game killing and all without feeling a pinch. Therefore, it is not that they are dark minded, well some of them are, but the system has prevented them from relating to the consequence of their decision. As if a feedback loop is cut, there is not enough information for them to think otherwise larr; I'm not giving them execues. But I do want to gain a better understanding of them instead of just despising them blankly. So now back on this book. If it is available, someone in the government would read it → that means government's knowledge pool (in a general sense) has these bits → US has a really good understanding of CCP, and vice versa → a looked confusing decision made by either government is likely based on such knowledge pool while the mass (myself as one, so are all the Beijing taxi drivers) will only be baffled because we do not have access to that knowledge pool → since gov has an army of smart people (analysts and so on) to collect, to study these books and information, its knowledge pool is logically more comprehensive and richer than any individual's → its decision can not be dismissed lightly. Instead, these decisions are logical, strong, and careful, but the flaw lies in that decision makers are systematically shielded from negative impact of their own behaviors, thus making them fly blindly → decision will be irrational, random, harmful, arrogant, even ridiculous. Therefore, the question is, how to give them a feedback loop? on technology I have been thinking over a lot about the line Siqi said that she is like mirror, merely reflecting the people around her. I actually wonder whether this is true to anybody ← don't we all be influenced (tinted or distilled) by our social environment? don't we all will adopt the behaviorial pattern, some necessary for a day-to-day survival, some just convenient (in this social circumstance)? don't we all learn from peer and others around us whose acts will inevitably impact our life (work & leisure) so we would have to react to them, thus involuntarily fall into the logical path that their behaviors have initiated? This makes me feel that human, as individual or as a mass, is fatefully trapped in an ebb of force-and-counter-force, which is exactly why we constantly feel 人在江湖身不由己. Then, what about freedom of the mind? control of your own life/destiny? be what you want to be?... are these just illusions one gives to oneself? or the society/media/government/education has etched into your mind, just like these communist methods to preach their ideology to the young so to shape their belief? → this is a bleak picture, I think. So, what's the role technology is playing? I mean, is it elevating us out of this trap, or is it deepening the trap, or just numbing us in a new way, like a new medicine that promises wonder, but ages later the generation will be laughing at it because it is made of nothing but harmless and useless dirt? One way or the other, what is the proof? Proof that it is helping There are plenty. Living standard is definitely much much higher than before, which was made only possible because of the development of technology — count any appliances you can't live without, iphone included. Well, one can also argue that the standard is measured by modern men, therefore looking from an ancient prospective, it is worse than then, not better ← well, it is a fair statement. After all, and adjective is up for debate (see mid night and euphemism ). But even for those organic fever person, natural's benefit is only enjoyable if nature's disease doesn't kill you like they used to, for which we owe to advancement of medical knowledge, to biology, to methods/workflows/statistics/... that made these advancements happen. So for that, as long as you are actually reading this article, you are already an beneficiary of technology, and your living standard is a fruit of technology. Proof that it is not working Technology is speeding up information flow, information storage, and information creation. My perception is that a vast amount of one-time data are being created due to convenience of technology. They do contain information; but that information will be permanently locked in itself that they will never be used → in other words, if we measure a life span of information from its creation to its demise, I would dare to guess that 99.99999% of all data that are being created today will be less than a day, an hour, an instant (can I find a study on this topic!?). When was a last time you flip through that selfie from yesterday, or last year's birthday party, or of your ex-? It was generated, stored (probably multiple copies on the Internet), and forgotten. Period. This feels like those sad stuff animals. But the rate of these information, especially the ones in digital form, is unprecedently higher than anything human has experienced up to the last 15 years! So, do we really know what we are doing? acceleration of generation crowding-out One thing I have been witnessing is that an acceleration of younger generation pushing out those who are less than even 10 years senior to them ← what I called \"China's youth culture\". In other words, the life span of a person's social contribution is under a mounting pressure — it's manifest in China that 00s is pushing out 90s, and 90s was obsoleting 80s, and so forth. Each generation feels a shortening window for them to be a contributor as worker bees, which in its reality sense means you will be viewed as too old to find a job . A common reasoning is that wealth has been rising, thus making leisure a more acceptable life style than a working bee ← after all, who wants to work if one can get a comfortable life without it!? But the \"Grow old better\" by Jared Diamond has another point — the Internet is now a repository of human knowledge. It enables the young with access to information that were previously unattainable unless you were privileged (priest) and old enough (elders in a tribe). Btw, they also operate those devices much better than older generations. Therefore, they should legitimately feel empowered and on par with senior peers. The competitive advantage of an older generation lies in their experience ← gained by internalizing these information and by practicing them (and failed more times over time). But then, how many in that generation holds up to that!? Few. Most people are not only lazy thinker, but lazy practitioner → they hear, but hearing is not listening. Therefore, new crops in their 20s are not only equipped with the same information, but are hungrier (socially), cheaper (financially), healthier, and can be over-worked without breaking down or revolution. As a captalist, whom would you pick? can information lead to democracy? Another hope of technology is that information transparency brings accountability, thus leaning towards democracy. It can be said that Arab Spring and many others were exactly that. But then, there is the GFW which we can conveniently blame for its backwardness. But how about many poor/developing countries/continent whose population has access to Youtube, but remained to be war plagued, struggling with basic human needs!? Cambodia doesn't ban Youtube. But even those who own a phone are busy making ends meet, and thoughts of self-education via these only resources have to be secondary at best. And among rich countries, information is not too little, but too much. Many of them are manufactured, manipulated, false, are skewing mass opinion under the cover of data analysis, AI, or simply, technology. If wealth of information is causal to a good society, then it is not showing its effect. Facebook falls into a fiasco of Cambridge Analytics. Is it really wrong to piece together a social profile of a voter in technology so to influence his/her vote? After all, didn't users give Facebook those data at the first place? and to ask them draw a line within which their data CAN be used, are they capable to describe, explain, let alone enforce!? I used to think there is an arm race between computer technology (cloud computing comes to mind) and evils like the GFW. I know for sure technology side will win. But I was also thinking a free information flow is good for everybody, and will bring enlightenment, reasoning, you know, all the good stuff. But I am becoming more and more pessimistic about this view now. The goal can be achieved: Access to information. Information is factual. Reader will read this information. S/he will internalize it (understands its meaning/intention). S/he can learn from it. ... the more I'm writing down this list, the more I feel there is no hope. The condition chain will break down as early as #2! I don't know. Technology is the best thing we know so far. It's not a wonder pill, not even a happy pill. It's a method better than none. Maybe just focus on getting #1 done, and let human carry his own fate from that point on. God bless us all.","tags":"thoughts","url":"https://fengxia41103.github.io/myblog/technology%20and%20society.html"},{"title":"Sadness","text":"Yao Han introduced me to this movie , at the time when we first met and were in love. I was 27, she was 19. I don't know how many times I have watched, listened to, and dreamed of, this movie. Each time it touches me deeper and deeper, makes me wonder why two people would love then go apart, marry yet think back, miss the other person but continue to live a life without him/her. why? It's a wonderful movie, a wonderful story. The guitar at Chen Li's funeral always gets me, every, single, time. It's beautiful, it's sad, it is a memory one can only dare to look at when the memory is about to disappear forever, still pains, still hurts, still live, still real. I don't know. Sadness, a boundless ocean of sadness, surrounds me when the music plays. I was talking to Noah's mom last night that I don't get overwhelmed in emotion, thus I hardly found myself cry. But this one, gets me, every, single, time. If one day I fall into a coma, play the music, the piece when Chen Li wrote a letter to Xiao Rou, confessing her thoughts for the last time, I will answer, for it reaches deep inside, that I, will tear, will sigh.","tags":"thoughts","url":"https://fengxia41103.github.io/myblog/sadness.html"},{"title":"Finite anxiety","text":"I was thinking. People get anxious on topic like bitcoin, why? Some talk says because the feeling of \"loss\" is greater than the feeling of \"gain\" even though the amount is the same. This has been proven in stock books. But then, things like bitcoin, or success, is NOT a loss ← you can only lose something if you had it already. As you can see, many many many times, marketing or hooligans will present this thing in a light of \"them being finite\" — there are only these many ocean view spots you can ever build a house for; there is only these many bitcoins determined by its algorithm (and do we have a math book on this algorithm!? and how much have we proven, on paper, that its set is finite!? I mean, how do I know this statement is true!?), and even life itself — you can live once, so maximize it (by doing ______ ). How familiar! but also how strange! Why is this effective!? Why do you get anxious when the resource is presented as being finite ? and if you take a step back, tell me one thing that is not finite!? Few, if not none! Then why bother!? Everything is finite, so why is this one any different? But reality is, that we get anxious by it — missing a love, missing a good job, missing a friend gathering, missing a lottery ticket, or simply, scared of getting old (life is a process of counting down, continuously, stubbornly, irreversibly, and sadly ← sad because I'm anxious!)... so why!? A missing opportunity? This feels like peer pressure. Everyone is getting on this wagon, I can't be left behind. Last time when I was at Reader's Corner, two old guys were chatting with clerk about aging. One guy said, \"you know you are getting old when your doctors are becoming younger than you\". Clerk said, \"I knew a woman who lived into her 100s. You know what is good about being that old?... she said, no peer pressure\".. hahaha. So true. So come back to the topic. The missing opportunity only comes into play if you consider that you can, or stand a chance, of benefiting from that opportunity; otherwise, I don't think it matters. But why do you think you stand a chance? One an age old confession is that human are over -optimistic when evaluating risks. There are many rational, for example, that's how human race has survived in the wild, so it's part of our built-ins. But this doesn't explain it. Then, alternatively, there is opportunistic, which is just \"exploiting chances offered by immediate circumstances without reference to a general plan or moral principle.\" But what's wrong of being opportunist? I don't know the difference. Isn't opportunity a good word? When so called an opportunity presents itself in front of you, how do you determine whether this is an opportunity? and how would you know whether taking it will jeopardize your integrity? If turn out your integrity or moral was comprised, well, you were an opportunist; if not, were you then an entrepreneur? But don't these also lead the same thing I have discussed over and over, that these are just words, invented by someone or some culture/country to describe a thing/feeling. Now writing this I feel the word should only be frozen in that moment when it was first appearing, because then we have no way to reconstruct the context in which it was invented, therefore any subsequent use of it is literally a risk of tagging something that is similar (maybe), but can also be the negation (also valid) ← how do you know!? → this becomes a chicken-egg race, you can't determine whether this is thesame-as/similar-to the original circumstance when this word was valid/invented because you don't understand the current situation yet; but in order to understand current, you have to use these words to describe (to your brain, really); but by using these words to describe, you have already committed their meaning/implication, and will be limited by their limitation. Therefore, you will not be able to jail-break so to understand the current situation as they are ← it's like looking through a tinted glass → everything will be blue-ish, if your glass is blue. Very strange a world we are living in, indeed! Human invented language in order to communicate ideas. But then ideas are expressed by language which themselves tinted the ideas so ideas are now becoming ambiguous, subject to interpretatoin, and abusive even. But cutting off all language, thus communication, will result in what? silence of the world? or death of the human race? or a idea-less crowd!? None sounds appealing. In this sense, English, being adopted by 70% of the world population (especially by the billion Chinese), is totally doing human a favor — then, everyone is also confined by English way of thinking, judgement, rational, and this mental dominance. I think this must be the theoretical foundation behind propaganda, that enforcing ppl to use your language is THE way to shape their logic, and to shape their mind → \"Now take this blue glass and put it on. Didn't I tell you that this world is actually blue!?\" \"OMG! You are sooooo right!\" Magic. Isn't it!? So when you get anxious over something next time, look for a different language to use, and I can guarantee this anxiety will go away. Reality didn't change; resource is still finite (as always, and will always be); anxiety, is just an English word trying to describe your feeling; and your feeling, can be called \"happiness\" in Mars's term, and they have a lot of books in Mars to teach you that, \"Happiness, is all you should care.\" Ha, ha, ha.","tags":"thoughts","url":"https://fengxia41103.github.io/myblog/finite%20anxiety.html"},{"title":"Mid night","text":"Since coming back from Spring Break trip, my body and mind have been really tired. Work is progressing fine. A lot of new things to learn, but overall are quite manageable. But work is just, work. I was sitting in this good looking, big kitchen 2 o'clock in the morning after fixing a few things, but I really missed you. Writing to you have become a habit, if not the only person I feel an urge to talk to, to share what comes to my mind, if not what sits on my soul. But I felt so lonely sometimes, since I don't know where you are about, and where you will ever be anymore. I asked myself a lot about whether there will be another time that our path will cross. But I can't feel it anymore. It feels as strange as if we had never met. I think it's better that way, I mean, to be able continue the path you were on, and take me as an episode of fun that enriches your life, but hold on to a course to what you feel so, and don't be distracted by me — I think this will be better, because I never left, and you will have me there when you need. I don't know. Life is not hard, it's just sad. It's a bit of sugar in a lot of sand. It grinds, and grinds, and grinds, till one becomes mediocre, plain, and somewhat heart-broken. America, is actually not a foe It looks just strange to me that these articles always have an implied assumption that since America is dominating the world but is not doing well , and China is catching up, if not surpassing, fast, that the two are looking at a battle/war that only one will come out live. How ridiculous a view this is! Through WWI and WWII, honestly, America doesn't owe China. On the contrary we should be grateful for their supplies to keep the country afloat. And even as for the world in general, America held up the Ally camp with its deep pocket and truly had a heart of a gentleman by not asking for colonies and territories even though at that moment there was not the slightest doubt that if he wanted, he would have had it. Besides, the whole talk about ZTE thus the national risk of not having our own CPU or so is just strange. After all, one country just can not have everything that he ever needs, period. So let's say we have come up a CPU capability, then what? Do we need to implement and manufacture everything in order to feel secure? This is just not realistic, nor practical. So there will be things that are ever important to so called national security, yet it is not controlled and owned by China, and you just have to live with this reality. If taking the example of an individual person, the practical approach is simply to be kind to your vendor (for things you don't have), and probably need to be kind to your customer, too, for things you have and want to sell. So the statement or the feeling of anxiety under the name of national security or national pride, is just bogus. This probably ties to what I have described as hurt feelings , that you can not control others' perception, thus China will continue to feel crisis regardless how powerful it has become, and this feeling of pride or shame (however you want to interpret it) will not go away, because they have chosen to feel that way, and there is nothing you can do about. Therefore, America is definitely a foe in that psychological sense. Once China has surpassed America, the world No.1 will not bring them a sense of satisfaction, it will only reveal how meaningless, or even burdensome, to be called No.1, and how the life of No.1 is so different from what it is looked like from a lower position ← after all, the grass is always greener on the other side. Facebook I feel like a prophet these days. Really. If you ever read my article on science , you would have known my position — data is neither truth nor fact. It contains information, but no theory has said that this information is good or bad, right or wrong, useful or useless, will do good or will do bad. Data is actually quite a dangerous thing, because the burden of information has been of collecting them and of storing them, in the past. But with the Internet we have not only made great progress on them, but have gone too far! I think we have created too much information — not in the sense of variety and taking much longer to read through, if even possible to learn and internalize. I think we have manufactured data that are simply misleading, bogus, meaningless, and outright garbage. The talk about Facebook becomes a laughing stock in China — a spectacular show of a hero fall from its shrine. But I think this is exactly why US will continue to lead technology, because audited by congress is just not fun, and you'd better get your notes lined up. I challenge any of the BAT to sit in front a committee like that and live through such scrutiny. This is like what ppl say about medical progress, that people nowadays have a lot more problems than before, but it's because we now have a name for it (before Dad, I challenge anyone in China has regarded his situation in any medical sense — dementia, Alzheimer). So let them laugh, ignorance is the recipe for happiness, indeed . Data collection and so called profiling of a customer or a citizen (as what China takes big data and AI for), is quite a topic worth debating. Let's say you get this capability. Then what!? How do you guard it from doing evil? But this leads to ancient topic that any power, super power in particular, always poses this same question. If you look data integrity , you will see that trusting these firms to be a Saint, or trusting government to be on its good behavior when they possess such power, is just plainly suicidal. Human lives in a virtual world Regardless what thoughts I want to express, or to discuss, inevitably I have to assign them a name, a tag really, because our own name is really nothing but a tag (but any new parent takes this tag ever so seriously as if it had magic power to determine future!) But it just feels so wrong, while so necessary. To me, human language (what do you mean by evil ?) is the HARD limit for human progress. I don't know how philosopher deals with this. They must feel more keen of this than I do. When I feel caught in these language loop , this whole world feels like a giant computer game, that we have invented all the names for things, invented a word to describe feeling, thought, so on and on, but in the end, the least clarity lies in those names, words ← Nouns, not too bad; adjectives, terrible; verbs, I think they are fine. Anything with adjective, is just BAD!!! Because it invites an endless question of what you mean by that, and how do you know that!? But sadly, Chinese language is filled with adjectives, and they are super proud of that effect, which leads me right to write euphemism . No, I would argue, stop using adjective as much as you can. Stop using language as if it says what it means, because no one knows, no one cares, even the language itself does not know what it is talking about. It's just all, mess.","tags":"thoughts","url":"https://fengxia41103.github.io/myblog/mid%20night.html"},{"title":"Use RHEL server qcow2 as sandbox","text":"The closest thing RHEL has to a cloud image is a qcow (download from here ).

There are minor difference between 6.2 and 6.3. Grasp the concept here, and hopefully you will have a good understanding of the Satellite models and procedures. Architecture One satellite server (master server), and 1+ capsule servers. The Satellite Server is required to connect to Red Hat Customer Portal ← main source of RH packags, errata, Puppet modules. The Satellite Server organizes the life cycle management by using organizations as principal division units ← one subscription manifest per org. org → location creates a matrix → 3 org and 4 location will create 3x4=12 management contexts. location is then tied to a capsule server (isolated). Info flow: external source → main server → capsule server → managed host. Content view Content Views are subsets of content from the Library (master copy of all contents). Multiple content views can be applied to one capsule server. Content Views can be combined to create Composite Content Views . Composite view is just a grouping. Individual content view, once updated, shall still be promoted, but the composite shell does not need to be changed. So from its consumer's POV, it sees the change transparently. RH subscription model The center piece of Satellite is RH subscription. This is how user/client can run yum install <pkg name> in RHEL. There can be multiple sources for you. In this discussion, we only distinguish them between on-premise Satellite source vs. everything else. what is my source? In RHEL, it's easy to find out which source you are pulling these rpms from. Look at /etc/yum.repo.d/redhat.repo : For example: [ rhel-7-server-openstack-11-devtools-debug-rpms ] metadata_expire = 86400 sslclientcert = /etc/pki/entitlement/2890837266996509363.pem ##### baseurl = https://cdn.redhat.com/content/dist/rhel/server/7/7Server/ $basearch /openstack-devtools/11/debug ##### ui_repoid_vars = basearch sslverify = 1 name = Red Hat OpenStack Platform 11 Developer Tools for RHEL 7 ( Debug RPMs ) sslclientkey = /etc/pki/entitlement/2890837266996509363-key.pem gpgkey = file:///etc/pki/rpm-gpg/RPM-GPG-KEY-redhat-release enabled = 0 sslcacert = /etc/rhsm/ca/redhat-uep.pem gpgcheck = 1 You see the baseurl points to cdn.redhat.com . This is the catch-all Redhat source, meaning you are pulling things directly from Red Hat. On a Satellite client, instead, you will something like this: [ Lenovo_IBB_Lenovo_Yum_Repo_Lenovo_yum_repo_SLES11SP4_Default ] metadata_expire = 1 sslclientcert = /etc/pki/entitlement/3451950880933034925.pem ##### baseurl = https://brain4-satellite.labs.lenovo.com/pulp/repos/Lenovo_IBB/........... ##### sslverify = 1 name = Lenovo yum repo SLES11SP4_Default sslclientkey = /etc/pki/entitlement/3451950880933034925-key.pem enabled = 1 sslcacert = /etc/rhsm/ca/katello-server-ca.pem gpgcheck = 0 For this one, baseurl is pointing to a Satellite server named brain4-satellite.labs.lenovo.com . Note that the .pem ( sslcacert ) is tied to a particular server (as url is in https !). Therefore, it is possible to switch source from Satellite A to Satellite B (see another section below), but cert needs to be switched together with url. Am I registered? From talk , on a RHEL system, ls /etc/pki/product : 69.pem : identifies this as a RHEL system, no registration. cert.pem and key.pem : created when you registered the system. <a long digit string>.pem : certificates for subscriptions that have been attached to this system. Subscription model From bottom up, package → repo → product → subscription forms the core, each pair has a 1-N relationship; subscription → entitlement has a 1-1 relationship. From these one can derive how many copies ( entitlements ) one can use, and last, contract defines time ← expiration dates. In its simpliest term, a VM consumes 1 entitlement of a subscription . So if you assign 10 entitlements to, say RH Enterprise Linux subscription (which as basic RHEL OS rpms), it will support 10 RHEL VM, and your 11th one will fail to do even yum update . RH subscription model A package is a rpm ( ref ). Essentially package is a name, eg, libgnomeuimm , where then there is a file named libgnomeuimm....rpm . But RPM can refer to both. So use this term with caution. .rpm file has format: <name>-<version>-<release>.<architecture>.rpm Satellite supports 5 types of repos: yum : RH native repos are in this bucket. So are things like Fedora EPEL . The key is the /repodata folder which represents meta data for this yum repo. file : One can upload any file to Satellite server. Satellite will create a URL and function as a regular HTTP server → client can just wget it from that. OSTree : These are OS images flattened on a file system. Docker : TBD Puppet : TBD Product: is a grouping of repos (so one can put it on a brochure). Subscription: is an umbrella term that covers not only the products one bought, but also service, patch, bug fix, and so forth ( ref ). It's the unit of software purchased from Red Hat. Subscription does come with a license, which, once installed, is with the system for life time. So even subscription expires, the system that uses these subscriptions are still functional. The difference being that once it's expired, you will stop receiving updates, service, and so on (so it's like rpms frozen in time). There are 2 types of subscriptions to consider: standard and instance-based . standard: qty 1-N , and doesn't matter deployment is BM or VM, always consumed 1. instance-based: qty 1-N , BM and VM consumes different amount (see \"Entitle accounting\" below for more details.) Entitlement: essentially a total number that how many clients can one subscription allows. For this, we need to do some accounting. Entitlement accounting how many we have From Red Hat Subscription and Entitlement Accounting (pdf) : In implementation, the subscription service (Customer Portal for hosted connectivity or Satellite 6 for on-premise connectivity) converts each subscription into a \"pool​\" of individual entitlements that can be attached to an end-system. The attachment process \"consumes​\" an entitlement from the pool thereby \"entitling\" the end-system to access content stores. The pdf has a clear example to describe this. In a nutshell, entitlements = subscription qty * entitlement qty/sub * instance multiplier how many we are using Now, how are entitlement consumed? From Red Hat Subscription and Entitlement Accounting (pdf) : Each subscription has a consumption rule that determines the number of entitlements (rate) that are consumed from a pool to cover the end-system.​ The consumption rule depends on several factors including: the subscriptions type, the \"unit of capacity​\" the subscription covers (e.g. sockets, ram, cores), and the deployed system type (physical or virtual); thus the consumption rate is governed by the following statements: \"Standard\" subscriptions consumed entitlements at a rate of: One per each virtual system deployment One per unit of capacity on the physical system \"Instance-based\" subscriptions consumed entitlements at a rate of: One per each virtual system deployment The \"instance multiplier\" per unit of capacity on the physical system. So to simply things, if we are looking at VM primarily, 1 entitlement per VM . Period. Manifest Satellite has no entitlement to use. The pool is under a user account and can be managed in Customer Portal. With the knowledge of subscription tyeps, we can create a Subscription Allocation which then can be exported into a manifest file. Satellite can import this file to establish its entitlement pool. Once you have created a subscription allocation , export manifest file to your computer, and see ref : Download manifest from Customer Portal (screenshot). scp it to Satellite server. On satellite server, hammer -u <sa user> -p <sa pwd> subscription upload --file <manifest zip> --organization \"<org name>\" If getting an error A backend service [ Candlepin ] is unreachable , see ref : service tomcat6 status , likely is in error. service tomcat6 start , then check status again, should be fine. Run hammer upload again. This takes a while for a file size of only 300+k. Don't panic. Now go to Content / Red Hat Repositories , it will list repos. Refresh subscription if allocation changed If we change subscriptions in the allocation using Portal (add/remove subscriptions), we need to SSH back to Satellite server machine, and refresh manifest : $ hammer subscription refresh-manifest --organization \"<org name>\" Enable/disable repo See ref . On Satellite server: subscription-manager repos --list subscription-manager repos --enable =[ repo name ] subscription-manager repos --disable =[ repo name ] Register a client to SA server Download `katello ca` from Satellite 6.3 server Two ways to register: activation key, or to an environment. register with activation keys On Satellite UI: create activation key: It asks to select an environment and a content view . By default, 6.3 server has a default environment called Library , which includes every subscriptions this SA knows about, and a content view Default content view , again a catch all version. Go to http://<sa server IP or FQDN>/pub/ , and copy address of katello-ca-consumer-latest.noarch.rpm . On client machine: Make sure it has a host name (hint: /etc/hosts , and /etc/sysconfig/network ). If DNS is not resolving SA server's name, you can add it manually to /etc/hosts . For example, SA server is at brain4-satellite.labs.lenovo.com with IP 192.168.1.100 , and the machine you are to register will be client1.labs.lenovo.com with IP 192.168.1.200 , simply add two lines in /etc/hosts : ```shell In /etc/hosts: 192.168.1.100 brain4-satellite.labs.lenovo.coom 192.168.1.200 client1.labs.lenovo.com ``` Then restart network services: ```shell systemctl start chronyd systemctl enable chronyd systemctl start rhsmcertd ``` Download katello-ca...rpm , eg. curl -O <link copied above> (Note: it is a capital O as oliver). Install, rpm -Uvhi --force katello-ca...rpm . Register, subscription-manager register --org=\"<org name>\" --activationkey=\"<key name>\" . Verify, subscription-manager repos --list . Go to Satellite UI hosts/content hosts , you should see this machine's host name. How contents are used It is actually quite confusing how to use it. I think the biggest pitfall is the mixed use of product , sub , repo on different page: For content view, you are to select by repo ← same product can have two versions of the same \"thing\", eg. RedHat OpenStack product can have two repos: Red Hat OpenStack Platform 13 for RHEL 7 RPMs x86_64 (OSP 13), and Red Hat OpenStack Platform 10 for RHEL 7 RPMs x86_64 7Server (OSP 10) at the same time! But from OSP's POV, these two version are not compatible ! For environment, you don't get to choose either content view or repo. You get whatever content views give you, and each environment can have N content views. For activation key, you are to add by subsctiption , and you can manually enable/disable by repo.

This is doing the right thing when nobody is watching. People with integrity practice what they preach and maintain a consistent pattern of behavior aligned with their values. They have the courage not to follow the crowd if it means going against their beliefs. Integrity is closely linked with the terms of honesty and authenticity. People with integrity tell the truth and have alignment in their thoughts, feelings, and behaviors. Well said, isn't it? Just came back from a long trip, I felt this piece described exactly how I feel what China's current society lacks, integrity. We had a red eye flight at 1:45am at Pudong airport. I was thinking to take the T line 9 → line 2, which on map gets to Pudong at last stop. I also know there is a switch on line 2, four stops earlier than the airport stop, that everyone needs to get off the line 2 train and transit to the other side of the platform for a smaller train (and this I never figured out why!? It's such a waste of traveller's time and energy, for the benefit of economy? energy!? for the few times I travelled on this line, the carts were ALWAYS packed! So it wasn't because only few people need to go to the airport thus why wasting precious subway space, and could get line 2 turn around quicklier that way, too ← sorry, not the case!) Anyway, so I looked up online for its schedule, and it was just confusing . That Guanglan Road stop was the trouble one. So I saw the extended weekend hour and it was passing midnight. So I thought this would just work since my flight is 1:45am. For pure odds, Noah and I got off at Guanglan Road stop around 10pm. Boy, just when we were getting off, a \"shorter train\" pulled into the platform on the other side, and everyone, I mean, the entire passenger who were on line 2, and I'm talking about like 60% full of the entire train set, started running to that train. I held Noah back since I figure, well, there would plenty train till midnight deadline. Then all of sudden, these swarm of people started evacuating from that train, and just disappeared! In between, there were a swamp of people asking whether you want a ride to airport ← those so called 黑车 (unauthourized taxi drivers). There were actually staff on board that train, but no one explained anything! Finally when the entire crowd was completely gone, left with a few dumb-founded faces, like me and Noah, dragging luggages and had no idea what is this about, asked a staff, who calmly told us that the last train to airport is 10pm → so there is no more train! WTF!!?? Then why isn't there any sign, direction, guideline to tell all these passengers what to do!? and what the heck running line 2 to passing midnight and having midnight flight while a 4-stop of distance has to be cut off at a different, earlier hour!?? What's the rationale!? I guess there isn't any. And didn't the gov battle these unauthorized drivers for years!?? well well well, you have just created this GIANT NEED for their existence! and I would even say you not only created them, you actually encouraged them to be in service!! Otherwise, what are these passengers going to do!? Apparently you are not helping them for sure! You actually kicked them right into this pothole and watching them to figure it out completely on their own!! Geeeee......... this is just, maddening !! Once we finally got the airport, for all its grandeur and cool looking, all terminal gates were shut! and every single passenger must enter this building from a single entrance! and it was windy, chilly, and regardless where you unboard your vehicle, you must walk to that entrance, and there is again, NO SIGN ! .. well, there was a human sign ← they acutally put a poor girl standing there to tell all the confused faces \"go to entrance number 24\"... what for!!?? I really don't get it!!! and I can bet all doors would be open when the World Repo was holding here! Just ridiculous! Then at custom, there was a single window open for poor foreigners! A single one! while citizen windows had like 10! and the guy who worked there was god damn slow! I guess they just love us so much that they didn't want us to leave. What a service, and what a country! And this, is exactly what integrity is about ← do things based on your value, not on impressing someone for a good show! Well, I guess these are pretty telling what values this city/country holds. So really, before you think you are getting back your historical glory and be the center of universe again, I for one, will not want to live in that universe at all, because our value systems surely are incompatible as far as I can tell. Peace.","tags":"thoughts","url":"https://fengxia41103.github.io/myblog/integrity.html"},{"title":"Too little sympathy, too much generalization","text":"Noah is a taking social intelligence course. A conversation gets me thinking, what is to measure a social intelligence? My observation of kids (and adults, too) is that we need sympathy — the feeling that your action will affect others in this or that way, and the uncomfort the others display truly get to you so you feel bad about it, too. It's hard, actually. How many times you curse the ass-hole on the road who just speed by you without a slightest concern what he does affects you one or another. But, on the other hand, where to draw the line!? You can be doing things while thinking about how others are going to feel ← this is just not practical, even the intention is certainly sound. I have discussed this in great length in my hurt feeling episode . Then further down the line, there is broadly used generalization of, everything! One post in our highschool wechat page is that Arizona Phoenix sold a piece of property that looks like a China town to a chinese SOE, and the company is going to tear it down. The outcry is that if this happens to Phoenix today, it is coming to Chinatown in Boston, NYC, and so on. Well, this is certainly an exaggerated example because the logic of generalization is too obvious and too weak to be defendable — to me, this is a typical case of tactic of fear when someone (the author?) uses to stir a public emotion in order to, not even achieve a goal I'm afraid, but sheer chaos and disturbance. Another case in the headline news these days is the Florida mass shooting. Honestly, I can't think of any solution to this, problem. The shooter is coward, because school will always be a target for these ppl — they are vulnerable, easy target, and killing kids hurt the most, to their family, and to the society. This is an economic calculation, not even a hatred motivation — \"I want to maximize the outcome with my hit\", or the \"why you rob a bank? that's where the money is.\" type of logic. If you hate ppl, or society, or just want to create grief, shooting kids is the logical, optimized move. How terrible this is!!! But then, sympathy leads right into generalization — if it happened in Florida, it may happen here, to my kids, too. I understand the feeling. Well, not only I understand, I share this whole heartedly. Everyday dropping off Noah at school becomes a jittering experience. A phone call from school reporting \"we need to talk to you that Noah had an incident\" is bad and upsetting enough; now imagine.... god I don't dare to even imagine that! So yes, I share the grief, share the pain, share the urge to do something so to prevent this from happening. However, I'm also thinking, are we generalizing!? School shooting creates an uproar in society because the social image of kids are such a crown jewel and the least disputable concensus in all society (pointing me one tribe, group, state, country, religion that kids are not deemed a near-God status) that it creates the perfect target for maximizing damage, and also the perfect foundation for generalization without being challenged. I don't think anybody wants their kids hurt at school. But, does anyone want to get cancer? HIV? or hit by a car? or not looking like Brad Pitt?.... HIV and Cancer are always the poster child of the uncurable disease. But the fact is, more ppl die from some low-profile name everyone just shrugs shoulder when hearing them. When was the last time you heard somebody talking about malaria , one thing made me truly admire what Bill Gates is doing with his fortune and fame!? And even talking about kids, I listen to NPR's report on Myanmar , young girls at age of 14 are being exploited, by local women and even their own family member, as sex slave(!)... and who is making an outcry for them, why aren't we are generalizing on their behalf!? Sad, isn't it? So this leads me to another reasoning, that what get heard, get attention, get front page, is indeed decided by the attention of ppl, or, what we care about. This sounds like a cleche. Of course, only ppl's attention will decide what they hear and care. Then what determines that? education? media? propaganda? I feel I'm running down a rabbit hole again. Sigh. Human society is just messy. Sorry, I don't get it, don't have an answer, not even a clue. At the mean time, hold on to sympathy in its generalized term. At least we should feel sad when others are sad, feel sorry when others suffer, and try to understand how our acts will affect others, intentionally or not. That's all.","tags":"thoughts","url":"https://fengxia41103.github.io/myblog/sympathy.html"},{"title":"Django to REST","text":"I have been building Django based web application for a while now. One design/request I get often is a REST API. Once the model data is exposed in REST, one can truly build a complete separate frontend using things like Angular, react, and whatever you fancy. I have tried a couple times myself following this architecture. On one hand it gives a lot of flexibility and it looks nice, too ← front end technology is a lot of \"{}\", but it does look quite nice, and responsive, too. But on the other, REST is a thing few understands well except it is an API through which you can CRUD. Honestly, I don't even understand yet how authentication is done, what is a good balance between massaging data (in Tastypie's term, (de)-hydration) and exposing data model raw. Anyway, here I want to document a practice I use, a really rudimentary one, of making django model available as REST resource through Tastypie. Django model reference Tastypie Let's say you are building a site called mysite , and in it it has an application called myapp . So the file structure will be like gitroot/mysite/urls.py for site-level URLs, and gitroot/myapp/urls.py for app-level patterns. The confusing part is that myapp/urls.py will be folded into mysite/urls.py . So the thought is that a site can have multiple applications, each defining its own sub-pattern , while the mysite/urls.py has the first run of the match before handing URL to myapp/urls.py to match further . So it's a matter of matching order. Anyway. So building a REST can be broken down into 5 steps: Step 1 : create an API varialbe name. Define an object v1_api in myapp/api.py . Name is not important at all. It is a Tastypie's Api object, therefore it comes with an army of capabilities: from tastypie.api import Api v1_api = Api ( api_name = 'v1' ) Step 2 : wire URL patterns v1_api defined in the previous step comes with a list of REST url patterns, and this is the beauty of Tastypie . So all we need to do is make these sub-patterns available through URL matching. As explained above, we need to wire these into mysite/urls.py : from myapp.api import v1_api as myapp_api <-- the variable we defined urlpatterns = patterns ( # REST url ( r '&#94;mysite/api/myapp/' , <-- pattern matching include ( myapp_api . urls )), <-- sub - pattern handler Step 3 : define your django DB model Nothing fancy here. Just the old school of data modeling. Step 4 : transform DB model to a resource model REST speaks resources . Packaging a DB model into a resource is quite simple: from tastypie.resources import ModelResource from myapp.models import MyModel <-- import DB model v1_api = Api ( api_name = 'v1' ) <-- we have seen this one ( see \"step 1\" ) class MyModelResource ( ModelResource ): class Meta : queryset = MyModel . objects . all () <-- data set to display in list resource_name = \"mymodels\" <-- string used in REST url \"/mymodels/\" v1_api . register ( MyModelResource ()) <-- expose it to URL This is the simpliest example to make magic happen. What's more you can do with this now? .objects.all() : you don't have to expose everything. Any queryset is adequate. REST will allow filtering as well. So just need to be aware what your decision means. de-hydrate : this is how you can massage your data set (essentially serializing and de-serializing) before you send data to user or taking data from data to DB. foreign key reverse lookup Django defines reverse lookup by defining a related name in model: class Datacenter ( BaseModel ): pass class Cluster ( BaseModel ): datacenter = models . ForeignKey ( \"Datacenter\" , related_name = \"clusters\" ) <-- related_name ! Consequently, DataCenterResource reverse lookup to cluster will be like this: class DatacenterResource ( MyModelResource ): clusters = fields . ToManyField ( \"vx.api.ClusterResource\" , <-- FK resource attribute = \"clusters\" , <-- django related name step 5 : enjoy Now go to mysite/api/myapp/mymodels ( mysite/api/myapp/ part is defined in \"step 1\", mymodels part is defined in \"step 4\"), it should show the queryset (defined in \"step 4\"). With REST, you can also do things like ?format=json or ?format=yaml , and ?a_model_field__gt= type of filtering . Cool huh!?","tags":"dev","url":"https://fengxia41103.github.io/myblog/django%20to%20rest.html"},{"title":"Moving, and a big trip","text":"The past weekend was the big moving day. Things actually went pretty well, except the morning pick up of U-Haul. What a terrible customer service they had! Well, it started with my fault really by forgetting to bring my driver license. Nonetheless, the only service was not helpful ← and it's just another example of euphemism that it gave an error message to retry during business hours of the self-service pickup location (which was closed for Sunday, btw, wtf!), and what it really meant, thanks for the last representative who revealed it to me, was that my account was blocked for any further self-service and my only option was to find a U-Haul location that was open and have a real person to help me. Really, once again, euphemism never works for anybody because it doesn't specify action to take to move things forward! Make it clear, as precise and actionable as possible, so to remove and minimize lost in translation. An ambiguity like that isn't a sign of politeness. Instead, it is a sign of arrogance and apathy, and smells especially bad in customer service. Moving is tiring. Really. It's not bad this time to move all the stuff since most of the stuff are already in boxes (and never left there since Boston). And also, I like my way of minimal living, that makes moving less of a heaache, for me, at least. One thing coming out of this life fiasco is that I learned to live on mininum, and started to realize how little one needs, physically and materially — things you could put away for a week or two, you can safely discard them without harming your way of living anymore than they would do to you if being kept around, moved around, attached as if they were necessary but they are practically useless. On the other hand, a minimal living emphasizes how much one would need to fill in this gap with mind, with soul, with emotion, with love, with something inner, someone to miss, some days to think of, some part of life to regret... I miss those days. I miss those people. I read books, give thoughts to a lot of sayings. I try to make sense of this world, make sense of people, history, society, try to figure out what is important to me, important to others, important to Noah. I get angry sometimes, because those BS annoys me to hell; I get calmer than before, too, because I can see through so many things and people now that I know what they are trying to do, and I feel it's really just up to me to decide whether I want to be part of this BS, if at all (and most likely I won't be, cause that will annoy me even further because now it will be myself being part of the annoyance, and I can't get rid of myself, what a pity). Friday is approaching. There is actually relief between us because there is no suspension anymore — it's done, it will be done. I have been preaching to Noah that if it is something you care enough about, make it happen, don't wait around . While saying that I always wonder on the back of my mind what this meant to us — do I really care so much about being official that way? Once upon in life I wished I were available then to be with her and gave her what she wanted. I feel this is a step I'm taking for myself so that myself knows I was serious, sincere, and truthful. It's how I felt, how I feel, and how I should have done, for both of them. Timing didn't play out, again, which is perhaps the theme of my life, or a curse? No matter. Destiny has its own course, and I don't want to guess nor expect. Whatever it may be, I am just hoping I can stay true, to myself and to others I care about — I sincerely live a life without ever thinking to hurt or harm the ones I loved and cared. If consequence of a mistake is hurtful just the same with or without a sincerity, I think having one is still better than having none. It's a selfish act I feel ← I care how I judge myself, but none how others judge me. Is this bad? I don't know. It is my way. Peace. PS. Books and bookshelves make me happy. I like the new bookshelves and my collection of books. I have been thinking by the day I go away, which book I would bring with me, if there were only one, or a few? I don't know yet. I like Practicing History . She has a sharp tongue, and cut-through pen. I like it. While reading it I was always reminded the line in 冯唐's book that reading book is like conversing with the author, through time. And lot of times I felt that she was there, and she is there, though far far far away, if not in front of my eyes, but in front of my mind, my heart. There is such a thing as soul mate, I believe, and she is mine.","tags":"thoughts","url":"https://fengxia41103.github.io/myblog/moving.html"},{"title":"A song","text":"It's a morning that you are touched, by a song. Quite out of nowhere when I was just flipping through Youtube trying to find something to watch. Then there was this movie , I probably have watched it before. I can't remember when now. I don't even recall its tune. But when the music was played, it echoed inside me — there were days when I was walking on the bridge in 太原, thinking of the future and Noah's mom, this tune was with me. At some point I actually thought it was something quite beautiful and genuine and I wanted to write it down before I forget. But now to think of it, it must have been there all along since I watched the movie some time ago, just didn't surface till this morning, or that day. But the song made me think of you. I could feel it, could feel you tossing around inside me as if you were just sleeping there. How real. I think that's the power of music, or should I say the power of missing someone, of loving someone, of wanting someone? Noah was a great boy today. The day didn't start well for him — he played his Prodigy and was happy, until I reminded him of his assignment due in a few days and he needs to work on it. There was silence, heavy silence. But then, he picked up his binder and started working on it. I guess the homework must be quite reasonable because before we hit I-40 exit he said he is all done! How wonderful! I remember the night, the moment, when you were next to me, and Noah was on your segway zooming around. That was a moment in life when I felt complete, there was nothing I would have asked, nothing. If only life could have ended at that moment, that would have been nice. Here he is, growing, still a boy with lots of boyish thoughts and mischievous ways. He will be fine. But what about you? where are you these days? and what's your life like? and are you happy? I don't know how many times you fly through my mind each day. A lot, I think. Listening to this song I felt this urge to tear, to miss the ones I have missed in life, the ones who are here no more. I wonder, maybe that's how one should count his/her age — by counting how many lives one has seen its end. I miss them, Lei, 波波, 臭豆腐, and all the lost loves that had once bestowed on me, but not anymore. Is this fate? destiny? It is interesting that last night I came across a line in the book , which says Buddha is meant to break the cycle of rebirth because life = suffering. So the idea, I guess, is that once you are out of this vicious cycle, your suffering ends and that's when you are saved . Sometimes I truly feel this is probably how it should go, cause life certainly is not easy. Then there are all the love vows one makes to the other person that if not this life, I vow to try again in the next, and one following till we are together, then we will never part . How touching! If looking from this Buddha lens, what this vow says is an incredible commitment, that I'm willing to go through another cycle of life, to suffer, to live through, and may there be even more of these rounds, because I want to meet you, see you again, and love you again . This is indeed a noble thought. You are giving up chance to be saved in order to fulfill a love you feel about another person (but if you think of it, how do know s/he has not quit the cycle and has bee saved already?) well, it does make sense though, maybe that's exactly why there are people feeling they are not finding the one they want ← because that person has been saved and is not in this cycle anymore! Oh mine, that's just disappointing, isn't it? Then what? I guess from what I know about Buddha, the only option now is to save yourself as quickly as possible so you could join her in that saved land (suppose the saved are going to the same place. nirvana? heaven? or even hell? does it matter then if your objective is to find that person and be with her? even if the place is called hell or whatever, I think it's irrelevant.) So here it is, a lovely lovely song. I'll hymn it for you, my love, someday, in some life:","tags":"thoughts","url":"https://fengxia41103.github.io/myblog/a%20song.html"},{"title":"Science disease","text":"Another Chinese new year. But what came to my mind this morning was something quite peculiar, if not irrelevant to the scene — what is science, or being scientific? Noah is taking some science class on rock and mineral, and I have just written about euphemism . This word, science, has been lingering on my mind and I wonder whether I'm telling Noah the right thing about it. So what is science? I always had this hunch that it certainly is not truth (but what is a truth, or anyone can possibly possess such thing as truth? I doubt it, if not completly refuting it). So the next closest thing is, fact!? Here is what webster says: the state of knowing : knowledge as distinguished from ignorance or misunderstanding So it has something to do with knowledge . What is a knowledge? webster definition: (1) : the fact or condition of knowing something with familiarity gained through experience or association (2) : acquaintance with or understanding of a science, art, or technique If I'm reading it right, even knowledge is not necessarily fact. Fact, according to Noah, is something you can prove. But don't you think the word prove is also troublesome!? What do you mean by proving? of your hypothesis, but doesn't it just validate your premise, instead of what we take fact as something that is objective ? How about turning it around, and say that fact is not something you can prove right, but prove wrong!? I like webster on fact : a : something that has actual existence space exploration is now a fact b : an actual occurrence prove the fact of damage 2 : a piece of information presented as having objective reality These are the hard facts of the case. 3 : the quality of being actual : actuality a question of fact hinges on evidence But then again, this seems to lead to more questions than answers → what is actuality ? Isn't it also depending on my perception, or existing regardless of my being? A common example to describe fact, \"this line is 3 feet long\" — but here I would question, if we both agree on the definition of number system as well as the word feet , so the most we could disa/prove is that whether the line meets what our definition says → therefore, it is a hard fact , but only to you and me!! Think of another person from Mars whose feet is different, this statement of \"3 feet long\" is certainly not True anymore. If you think of it, there isn't a single fact in this statement at all!! Are we saying that length of an object is a fact we can always measure and prove? Not quite so! what is a length? why not call it width, in Mars system? and who says there is such an attribute called length that we commonly link to a physical object? but even in this sentence there lies a twist — a line, is virtual!! So are we saying that length is an attribute applies to both physical and virtual object? But certainly it is not a required attribute, because, why can't we have an object that has no concept of length, at all!? Then what? Science, is becoming a disease Headache. What I'm really getting to is this. I believe we have turned the word science into another label that we freely slap on things — I call it window dressing — and people have bought into this idea that science is such a vigorous and superior, thing, that it automatically validate your saying — that's it! I think what lies in the core of all these labeling is that speaker has a need to validate his/her saying... wait a minute, really? why do you want to validate? I think it's a power you are trying to give yourself so your message will prevail. If power can come from other mean, validation, or science in this matter, has a diminishing return, therefore will just disappear, as we are seeing everyday in politics, media, and many many other occasions. Makes total sense! why do people want to prevail? To benefit? not necessarily. A psychological need? This is more likely, but I can't elaborate what this is. To dominate so to protect him/herself? hmmm.... this is a likely reason also. As I observed, dressing to be scientific is more prevalent when being in a unfriendly crowd — if among close friends and family, who the hell care whether your statement is really valid, or factual, or backed up by numbers or not. Often enough we even skew the sentence on purpose, just for a funny effect and laugh. But then, I hate that these days every argument is traced back to our million-year-old ancestor and their survival instinct, as if a trace of such thing, even a tiny portion among all the other developed, evolved, changed, updated, attributes, is still sufficient to make the case. Especially when people bring up the instinct of survival, well, who doesn't want to survive, first!? Therefore, as long as your argument traces to your so called survival instinct, it becomes unreputable — but this to me really is just an argument bully ! Don't we all agree, and actually broadcast, that there have been living example that a subject will not put their survival instinct on top, when there was something significant enough to override your survival instinct ← such as patriotism, personal love, and parenthood? So first, let's make the statement that desire to survive isn't a sufficient argument why people want to prevail in a crowd. It's a strong one, but I don't think it's a sufficient one. Second, science is subjective. It has dominated my generation (and many before and many to follow), but it is one of many methods we human use to make sense of this world. Science so far I would say has developed the most number of tools and methods facilitating this effort, and have figured out a system to spread its teaching. It seems to answer the most of number of questions posted by God, but quantity doesn't speak quality — science is not the only tool, the only method, the only teaching, and its answer is not the only one that makes sense . Third, ah ah! don't you also observe that many many many articles always make to this number so to make the points more, convincing!? I don't know. There is definitely something about this number in argument! I actually wonder that three is the capacity of human brain (for most of us) to summarize information. Anyway, off topic. So I'll skip number three. I don't have one. Two is fine. bogus (science) is epidemic If science is viewed in this lens, I would have to rant (more) on how this technique of window dressing has become an epidemic in Chinese scenes. Oh boy I don't even know where to start. Every show you tune to, every article I have come across in the last two years, everyone I spoke to and listened to, the word science is being used left and right as if we are now in the age of science and are now becoming a part of this, enlightened?, family. Sigh. But really, if my message has any value to you, it should be obvious now that they use the word simply to make a stronger case for themselves whatever their agenda is. Science is a view, and as any other view, it is personal, it is subjective, it is fallible, and it is debatable (.... almost did 3 myself!) Throwing numbers around isn't science, isn't scientific. Quoting a research finding without first stating its assumption and experiment methods, and in particular its reasoning, is simply slogan shouting, and is just wrong, I mean, morally, wrong! I don't believe there is a correct science. But I do think there is bogus science — definition being one that omit definition of its premises and presenting conclusions/opinions with a illogical reasoning. One sign of a bogus science is that its statements are loaded with adjectives such as many, much, very, most — and conversations on stocks and medication are the worst — you know this stock CAN fall up to 20%.... why can't it fall 21%? or 100%? or -200%? of course it can, and you can't even state how like it CAN! A line like this, is what I would call a bogus science ← it slapped a fine, scientific number on itself, but it has zero information nor validation.","tags":"thoughts","url":"https://fengxia41103.github.io/myblog/science.html"},{"title":"To Nianyi","text":"Hi, Haven't been a while since I wrote you anything. I'm listening to this movie while working, and felt I have something to say to you. I want to say I'm sorry, sorry for being such a ass recently, for not speaking to you much these days anymore, for checked out from our family and am moving away. I'm sorry. I feel very very sad. I wanted to be nice, but there is something stuck in my throat, that made me not able to respond when you ask me question, when I should have said things to you and Noah in a nice way, to be patient with him, and you, and this family, and our situation. I'm sorry. I don't have those anymore. I lost patience, lost willingness to save our marriage, lost courage to go through the thin and thickness of life with you as I have promised. Up to recent week I still though I had a chance to revive your feeling, and maybe you could turn around and realize how难得we had come along these many years, though filled with many happinesses, also moments of laugh, lightness, fun, love. But I can't hold on to this wishful thinking any longer. Tian Wentong told me you two had a chat while in Beijing, and you have already determined back then. I don't mean to blame in any way. I just wished you could have told me this earlier. This is the same struggle I have had with you for the last five years, maybe even longer, that I just don't know what your thoughts are. I don't know whether it's my being insensitive thus missed all the signs and cues you must have had for me along the way. I honestly did not see them. I apologize that I haven't been smarter than I had been, so I could have been a good husband and partner, and could have avoided all these stressful days I have caused you and Noah. I'm sorry. This is a lost battle. I don't know what could have saved us. I tried to get away, tried to find love, tried to come back, tried to heal myself with other women. In the end, I'm further and further away from you, and you are further and further away from me. I used to think I could not live without Noah. But now, I sometimes want to get away from him, too, and this thought scares me. I don't know what is going wrong with me. I'm sad, just sad. My brain is still spinning as fast as ever, but my feelings are cold, distant, and sad. Pls don't blame this on the girls and women I met and brought into our life. If there were fault and penalty, I should be the one to bear. Period. They were all loving people with a warm heart and a lovely soul. I was not in a position to give them what they want. Yet I didn't resist their intimacy because they made me feel live again. I have been selfish in this regard; I wanted to. I know what I was doing, and I made the choices without regret. So whatever they lead to, such as the moment like right now, I should face it, deal with it, and live it. I feel sorry these made you unhappy, if they did. I don't dare to guess such things anymore, because you are becoming a mystery to me. I don't even know whether you care, and if you do, why you care. It's still important to me, but I lost all touch of your inside, and thus am less than a stranger you are willing to chat on the street. Such a long time, the past 9 years we somehow crawled through. I don't know who else can bear with me for this long, and give what you gave. I used to believe there must be someone who cherish what I have; but I am not confident of that anymore. I know I'll continue to meet someone. But the courage needed to tie a knot and to give promise is thinner than ever. This is sad. I yearn for companionship; yet, I fail over and over to live in one. What you and I had were the closest to a family life I had in mind. Love is like soil to me — one can live without, but one can't stand without. I constantly think over the women I had in my life, lovable, beautiful, regretful. I did good with some, and failed with others. I had the best chance with you, yet here I am, finding a place for myself so we will call it over. Noah used to be a string attached me to this family so I will come back. But even he is becoming a lose string now. And I always know this is a losing battle if we just maintain the status quo — nothing will stop him from growing up and becoming more and more independent. This string that attaches you and me, will have be let go sooner or later. Then, what we two still have left to glue us together instead of drifting apart? I am tired now, and am old now. I often think of death, and last days in my life, like a movie rolling in front of eyes. It is not scary, but too many regrets. I wish I could have known better back then, could have been less self-confident self-important self-centric back then, have been older, or younger, when I met you and them, could have had different personality and patience level when dealing with our issues back in 2012 and 2013, could have been nicer to Noah and you in recent months, could have been a less sentimental person, could have just been an asshole regular common averagely-educated pickup-truck-driving man so I don't feel or care that much. I'm sorry I'm pulling away. There is nothing left for me to try. I used to hate the idea that we are to pay two rents instead of one, while these money could have been used for Noah's college fund, or a nice decor in living room. But I realized how weak and unrealistic such thought is — it's an engineer's urge for maximum efficiency I guess. Since there are million other women I'm willing to look at all live with their own rents and places, low efficiency is the reality, not the other way around. So what to deter us living in the same pattern then? None. I realized that if we go apart, we each will start to live our own life, and therefore there is no point to think about the ridiculous saving we could have achieved otherwise. How slow am I to grasp this idea when it must have been completly obvious to everyone? I wish this realization could have come earlier, so I could have not dragged you along in the last 5 years and caused you frustration and agony. I'm sorry. I'm learning, just always too late. Our marriage is not nourished to either of us. Noah is not learning to communicate, to interact, to handle intimacy, to see a fun smiling parents together. I feel bad I didn't figure out, nor strong enough to come over this. I know all these will become so unimportant when another 10-20 years pass by, just like how we look at the things that bothered us to hell that many years back. Time doesn't heal; time doesn't make us forget either; time just makes sense less and less tender till it couldn't feel much anymore. Hopefully I will find a place soon so you don't have to look at my temper and rudeness anymore. This place will still be yours, if it's ok with you. I wanted to have you pick one you like. But my strength and my wish to save our relationship burned out. I hate how I'm treating you and him. So I have to change this by staying away. Thank you for the marriage, for tolerating me, for allowing me to stay with her last year, for putting so much in this family and Noah's life. I probably won't be able to shoulder much of your burden in the future anymore. So, take care. If in need, I'm still willing to help.

Life is indeed full of puzzling person and phenomenon that annoys me and I found myself always wonder why they do that and what I have done to make them act that way (or regardless what I have done and do, they are just like that). Why? The new house is coming together nicely. All the good decisions were made and the outcome is really satisfying. Bill is a good guy. But then, communication with him is just not there — calling him didn't usually feel welcomed, and calling me always starts 7is in the morning (regardless the day of the week) and it's always when I needed to pay him. How, one way, ish. After getting off that annoying phone conversation with him, I was thinking that this is both entertaining and annoying — I thought I'm an angry old man. Well, here he is, an even angri er than I am — funny, and rude. Oh well well, no harm done, so be it. history, euphemism Reading \"Practicing History: Selected Essays\" by Barbara Tuchman , I am deeply shocked how terrible track record of human had been and how ugly the outlook of current days would be (and already have been). It's really disturbing and sad. The good news is that I found a new word, euphemism , I feel it's exactly the noun I have been searching for to describe those bloated response of Chinese language I have been complaining about. I'm not sure I agree with its dictionary description, but I can see the root of it is that an act of window dressing to make something sounds prettier, better than it actually is, with a motive of what!? In the oriental world the common perception is that the drive of saving-face is a strong argument. But honestly I now fail to see the line between face-saving and trickery — by dressing up and avoiding a clarification of the words in use, I would argue that you are just giving me a false impression and leading me astray, often with a deliberate intention of such false effect as the outcome! Isn't this trickery or what!? I really enjoyed her words on history because she stated clearly the words she meant, and her stands on things she discussed. See, this is what a historian or any profession should do — a thinker who questions order given in a broader sense than his/her own job and command chain, derives an opinion and judgment with your own argument, and take a stand for question and discussion. It's hard, confusing, destructive, anti-progress, anti-many-status-quos, but it is necessary, must. technology != True. Period. Her words led to think more about my profession — technology. Yes I have had this feeling recently that words like \"education\", \"technology\", \"science\" have been misused as if it's outlook is unquestionably good and its cause universally agreed! But far from it I'm afraid. Not only its outcomes have been proven to be a disaster (in history) in many many places and periods, but its ingredient and reasoning have been borrowed by too many statements so they are now universally used, but hardly understood and checked! Everybody talks about science as if anything now prefix-ed by the word becomes a valid offer. Really!? I was thinking the Chinese word xx学, what does it mean!? Is it science? is it research? or is it knowledge? For science, I think we are talking about a pattern that is recognized, has predictable output when given a known input. We believe we know the mechanics that converts the input into output, in a understandable, documented fashion. Technology, on the other hand, is far from it. It is nowadays being used as if itself is the answer to problem. Not at all! Technology is at most a method, and I would even take this further to say that it is an opinionated implementation of something. What it brings us is efficiency, what it derives is a query into the problem (if there wasn't a definition of problem, it will create at one version; if there is a version to work with, it throws more dimensions at it so we know more about that problem after) so we get more insights. **In the end, it is a mechanics to facilitate discussion, not an ultimate solution as many many Powerpoints are preaching. In today's atmosphere I feel the equation of technology=science is becoming a conceptual pattern. Even more disturbing is that it has been extended to become technology=data, technology=science, science=True , therefore data=True ! Oh mine. I don't even think euphemism is sufficient to describe this fear of mine — this is utterly insane, and false, and unacceptable! let me try to argue And here is my argument. technology First, technology is a tool, like a hammer, that we need to first say the task is to knock a nail ! Without that, hammer itself is a neutral, meaningless, piece of metal on a wood stick. It will then become a weapon if the 2nd piece is now stating the task is to wave and knock down that guy charging at you with a katana — you see the point? Technology itself should not be elevated to a Sainthood. It doesn't deserve it, and it never says so itself. Technology is a powerful tool, but the user who swings that hammer and the goal of that swing are what we should be discussing, questioning, and debating. Throwing the buzz word \"based on the latest greatest technology\" is confusing and BS. Technology is just a tool. It requires a definition of the task to achieve, and its effectiveness is at mercy of its user. knowledge, truth Second, there may not be a truth, but there is knowledge, and the purpose of gaining knowledge is not to seek truth . I don't believe there is truth, absolute or not (I think in common thinking we also have an equation of fact=truth . I'll accept that definition, then it still holds that data!=fact, therefore data!=truth ) Therefore, it doesn't compute if it is the goal of anything. What is a knowledge then? I can only think of a definition that knowledge is a personal awareness of (input → output) pair (the \"→\" stands for a transformation mechanics). Yes, it is subjective, and it has no right or wrong. I know this sounds quite strange. Knowledge is subjective. It is defined as output = transformation(input) . Truth, if exists, = facts. data It is both funny and sad witnessing Chinese talks swing from complete ignorance of data and digitizing information (so to gain conformity, consistency, and efficiency) to these days data everywhere as if data is a truth. Of course not! Data is a presentation of information, that's it. You can certainly point at someone's photo and make statement that he is a bad guy (you actually mean he looks like a bad guy , or he has a bad guy's look ? I'm not sure even yourself knows which one you meant!?), but no one is going to take that as fact or truth because it is just one look of that person's million dimensions, and you didn't even give the definition of your knowledge equation of (look → bad guy)! See!? You need to define: what is a look ? what is the transformation mechanism? what is a bad guy ? Only then, your statement based on data becomes clear. But no one says your equation is accurate , valid , correct , True ! Therefore, having data itself does not (in)validate anything. It is an ingredient to establish a reasoning which always depends on the view point of the analyst and the process that logics are derived! Data, has information. But it is not fact (and leave Truth out of this will be wise). Data is another form of information. Information can be used to reconstruct a fact. But even that is a far-fetched wish because then who is defining that fact ? I feel it is a lost battle.","tags":"thoughts","url":"https://fengxia41103.github.io/myblog/euphemism.html"},{"title":"Big D","text":"This has been a long past due as I have been thinking about this for the last few days, and have attempted to write a letter a few times, but always not feeling the feel , and when the feel was there I was usually busy running around for things that is far less important but more imminent. I think the actuality is that I don't know what to say about it — on the day I submitted the paperworks, stepping outside the course house building, nice warm sunny peaceful almost cheering urban scene with pedestrians walking by and a few hovering around as if they had all the time in this world, I sat down on the metal garden bench, felt, I don't know, relieved? not really. ease that something on to-do list is finally done? yes, some. sad? yes, some, too. But yes, I felt sad. I felt I was letting people down, without knowing what's laying ahead, and knowing I have broken a vow that I casted sincerely, whole-heartedly, believed, wanted, proud of, but now have failed her, and myself, and the principle I have been preaching to Noah, that don't make a promise that you can't keep, and I always thought that is one thing I have held, and will hold true to myself, to others who have come across and will come across my path, that I can and will keep a promise I made & make. Yet, here I am, sitting here, and have broken THE promise I have made to a person I loved, cared more than myself, at really not much of her own, have turned into someone I now can not look straight into eyes when we talk. So sad. Really. How could any vow be trustworthy anymore? how could any promise be held to its end anymore? How could I have peace with myself after I have betrayed the one thing I dear, and the one person I deared, anymore? Hi, This is a letter I have been wanting to write, for the last few days at least, but don't know where to start or how to send. But let me try. I want to say, I am really really sorry, that it has finally come to this. I feel sorry I have let you down, have let Noah down, and is the one breaking up a family we have. I am really sorry. On one hand I felt it's been long past due, that it should have ended a long time ago so the agonies we have experienced in the past few years would not have been necessary; on the other hand it never feels a right moment to do this. It is like watching your own child or pet sick in bed but all you could do is watching it slowly fade, weaken, and die. I don't know. I have this resentment inside me against you, which made my both unpleasant, rude, and unhealthy, not only to you, but to anyone around me. I used to resent you not trying to save or to change our situation. But I also question myself whether I have tried, and what I have tried. I tried to go away, try to make my absence a painful reminder to you of what we had, met two in my life who, inevitably, left a mark on our breakdown, one smartly chose another man better than what I could give her, and one spoiled me with her love and beauty to put me back on my feet. I am the lucky one. I always had wonderful women in my life, from the first girl I met, to you, to siqi. I couldn't help now facing the harsh reality that it must have been me who have disappointed you all, by not being wise when I need to, not being sensitive when I need to, not being respectful, or forceful, or independent, or mature, or any of the adjectives that woman wishes in a man, when it should have been there. Sometimes I thought of those blant riches who claim not to marry until he has enough money to give his woman comfort and style. I still can't bring myself to approve this view. But I see its merit now — it is better, more responsible I think, to provide your loved one such things, than expecting her to be on your side thick or thin unconditionally — it's an idealistic version of love life, but not life itself. I want to thank you for the years when I was jobless, wondering around with a bloated ego but a pathetic understanding of you. I really enjoyed the years in MBA, and the days when I felt at the brink of fortune and fame. But more and more with each day passes, I hate the version of me in those days because I was ego-centric, self-importance, self-centered, short-tempered, aggressive, and greed of success to prove myself. Looking back, it is also a double-edged sword, that having you and this family made me proud, gave me confidence, resulting in an enlarged ego, which in turn led me astray — in the process of building a better life for the ones I cared, I lost the ones along the way. How pity was I! If you have seen through all these back then, I would have to say that you are indeed wiser than I realized, and which makes me even more in debt that you have still agreed to be with me. Ten-year is not the longest of a personal relationship I have experienced, but is most intimate one of that length, and certainly a fruitful one because of Noah. I sometime think of him whether he is a bond or a bond-breaker. What would be us without him? would less stress from raising a child have made things easier? better? or worse? I don't know. On his good days I had no doubt he is the best decision having made; then on the others I wonder what I have done. He is fine. He will grow, regardless how we raise him or what we give him, or not give him. My resentment used to be caused by imagining an ideal life for him that he now is going to miss. But truth is, he will be fine. He will adopt a life of his own, and however we think we have shaped that, it will not be. There will be residual memories of how we have conducted things that he will recall, will take in, and will apply. But the majority of him will be picked up randomly from him school, his friends, his hours and days when none of us is around. There is the influence of genes; then there is the influence of the world. Whiling reading those disturbing books, sometimes I even wonder whether bringing him to this world is a good or a bad thing. Life is hard. I have yet to come across anyone whose life isn't — there is always a seemingly glory on surface, with torrents of trouble underneath. Five years ago it scared me to think of separation, logistic headaches, and the gloomy prospect of future life. Now, I think it's just there, whether separation or not, different set of problems, but equally challenging, agonizing, and scary. I think it's better this way, at least no suspense. One day I was driving and was thinking over financial statement analysis, a book I am reading, a line suddenly occurred to me, if I were a comedian standing on a stage, is that \"If you are a disorganized person or company, how should you manage you finance!? Just take on a shit load of debt, so now the banks and lenders will put together the best statement and analysis of you yourself don't even know how to, and will also watch your progress in such a keen spirit that no change will escape. So now just for free, you have an army of experienced accountant, analyst, finance expert, to work for you, for free! ha, ha, ha\" Because, by doing so, there is no analysis needed anymore, no suspense, no prediction of how well you will be doing if I lend you money — you are in debt, done. I think this principle applies in life. Instead of keeping a suspense, I am dropping the other shoe, so it is now done, and we can all react to it with fact, not guessing. With Noah between us, there will always be a tie uncut. So I don't think this will be the LAST letter to you. But if I do end up dead tomorrow or the next moment, at least I wrote down everything I want to say at this moment, and made it available to you. Since I have failed to keep a promise I held dear, I should be extra truthful and honest, so that I would, by the time of my death bed, claim myself an honest person. I used to think high of myself with many good traits. Now, I only wish I could win this last defense. I meant to say sorry when I handed you the notification, but I didn't. I was afraid of tears, emotion, and waver of this decision. I retreat to this mean I know of, by writing and email. I think it's better to write, as it gives me a chance to reflect, to organize my thoughts, to re-read and re-check, so I know I am speaking with understanding of what I am saying, and what it may bring. I am really really sorry. I let you down. But now you are free, and I can not hold on anymore. What I owed, I don't know how to repay, and can not repay with any satisfactory conclusion; what I may help, I will be there. I may drift now in life and in space, so I don't know where I will be eventually. But I will make myself available if you ask.

This book is just stimulating, fun, and sharp. It actually hurts. It describes sooo accurately of what I feel about many aspects/signals in life that I come off with a much clearer idea of what all these things are about and why they exist and behave in such a way. Super interesting. One thing for sure, Noah will be a middle-class man, because I simply do not possess the attributes of the uppers, thus having no ability to teach him that. Yet I truly wish he would become one someday, not implying the fortune or the fame, but their carefree of others' opinion, their accurate use of words in its essence and intent, their blunt expression without ambiguity, and their dismiss of artifacts created without practical purpose. This is brilliant! Really. I have been agonized by proliferating use of adjectives both in my own language and others for a while (even this exact sentence is full of adjectives I feel redundant, harmful!). I could not get to the bottom of it. I realized that adding more adjectives make the sentence long and richer (it seems), thus giving (or I should say, I, the speaker, hope ) a sense sophistication and profoundness — but really many many times I felt it is a cover-up job because I (the speaker) simply lack the accurate understanding of the topic, thus having to pile up big words and adjectives so to describe it with an attempt to be accurate . Well, at least in my case the intention is to make it more accurate than what my mind is capable to describe. There are another army of cases (that just annoyed me to hell, whenever I hear them in speech, see them in writing, or smell them in the air!) whose sole purpose is pretentious (learned this word from this book, what a lovely word!). Ah, how about another word, euphemism — this is exactly what I talked about China's booming degradation of its language — people are proud of speaking in riddles as if it carries more information than it contains. But the only effect is misunderstanding, anxiety, and completly irresponsibility of the speaker because the words are intentionally infallible, ambiguous, and keeping audience in perpetual suspense! When upper says \"I want my daughter's wedding to be right\", I think they have a clear picture in mind of what is right (and certainly what is wrong). However, when the word \"right\" is being used pretentiously, neither its speaker nor its audience dares to stand up for a definition — the speakers feels superior to audience because s/he has just used an infallible word whose correctness is implied, inherent, built-in ; the audiences wonder whether they didn't get it just because they are stupid. How sad. How outrageous! This is not merely ridiculous, this is absolutely bad. I am glad to come across this book, not because I agree with his view of society (or even class divisions), but a sharp tongue to remove those seemingly elegant, civilized, sophisticated items in life. This is a book all marketing people should read, study, discuss, and apply — I always believe good sales is about a good understanding of the group (segment, but now we should just say class ), about their human desire (of a projected image of themselves, eg. the collectible item example in this book, or the British product name, and of course the easy way to show $$ by dangling a luxury handbag with bling-bling name plate, and fondness of personalizing anything). If I have citicized marketing before, I will emphasize my view once again — stop thinking you are smarter than your buyers by selling your ideas to them ! On the contrary, your success relies on you learning their ideas — you see, the whole team of China marketing gurus is getting this reversed! So, call it whatever you want, and feel free to agree or disagree this book however you feel. The point I make here isn't about the class descriptions, isn't about signals to identify and categorize anyone, anything into a 9-grade system. It's the spirit of being practical, being truthful to oneself and to others, being real — if you don't know something, just say it, \"I don't know anything about it.\" This goes to all used broadly, freely, carelessly in China these days — 专家，老师，先生，大数据，人工智能...","tags":"thoughts","url":"https://fengxia41103.github.io/myblog/class.html"},{"title":"Society","text":"I have been doing a lot of thinking recently, about human society. There are multiple themes in my life and in my thinkings that I find them interesting, disturbing, annoying, and saddening. The more books I'm reading about historical events and views, the more I question how a society, or any society, can survive and develop, and whether there is a pattern (or lesson to learn from) that propels their initiation, growth, and declination? I don't know. Human society is messy. That's the only word I can think of. Listening to NPR makes this feeling stronger all the time — I actually feel sorry for government officials, politicians, and advocates who are either in a position to serve the people, and to help all . It's an illusion that, in my opinion, both wrong and impossible. I'm not sure how much they really believe in what they are saying and preaching, and they are set out to do. Chances are, I would dare to bet, they are feeling the conflicts within themselves all the time, that they are not devoted as they show to their cause, but then, they are in a position that they have to pretend, not necessarily for fame and glory, but for their survival and reconciliation with themselves. tested This is sad. Reading the book Auschwitz made me wonder how deep the rabbit hole goes!? It strikes me when the German commando of concentration camp questioned how someone who had not been tested could be his judge? This is very true I think. If you haven't been in that situation, you really don't know how much yourself is going to change, and how much that toxic environment is going to modify your behavior and thinking. For these natiz criminals (this I have no doubt that they have done the anti-humanity act not out of their excuse of following the order , but out of a balanced decision of benefit and cost — it could have been completly rational at their individual level), at least they have done what they have done in those context, and we know how low they had been. But because of the extreme characteristics of those act, it should also raise a question mark on the head of everyone else who is being judgmental of being right or wrong. I know there were many great examples and people who did not fall into the low in the same overall circumstances. But do they then serve as a proof of human strength? I mean, how much can we generalize these attributes against the ugly ones? What I see is an alarming pattern of people who submit themselves to the oppression as a majority's choice, this echoes the same question I asked 小舅 about why people didn't revolt during the Culture Revolution. I don't know what is the theory behind this, but it has been demonstrated over and over and over in Holocust of any form, and which could only mean that this reaction and mechanism is a built-in part of human → so as long as you and me are human, we own this attribute, and will inevitably at mercy of its effect. But how to interpret heroes and heroic acts in those times then? They were human, too. Why didn't they suffer from these built-ins? I don't know. I wonder whether it is again a trick of labeling that I have been debating with myself recently (a lot). You see, we take a certain type of act as being heroic, while viewing others as criminal. But what is the criteria to judge them? Law? isn't law also written by a bunch human? then who says their opinions should be the law ? To that matter, there are many words I start to question (but no answer yet): science hate vs. love race discrimination I feel they have been over-used in such a blanket fashion that it's really an abuse now. science Science is being spoken as if itself is a Truth, a good thing. No. It is a view, an opinion, just like all others. Its difference from previous Gods and superstitions is that its equations and interpretations can in some cases predict the future — when is the next total eclipse? But quoting something as scientific in many many discussions is not even centered around this, but as a take-for-granted attitude that science is better than (whatever your argument is). No, no no! This is just BS. This is what I call labelling . You slap a label called scientific onto your argument, and violla, yours become valid, accurate, and better — or do they!? I would immediately challenge: What is your definition of being scientific ? What is your proof that yours is scientific ? (and mine isn't) Why yous being scientific is therefore better than [blank, fill in whatever you are arguing about]? Exactly. Science is not a catch-all phrase. It does requires a way of thinking (through experiment and quantification), which is being highly regarded by current human race. But objectively speaking, it is on an equal footing with other views of this world. I think its power lies in two folds, which makes it a implementation (for the time being, my life for sure): its much-more-likely-to-be-true predictability than other methods on a day-to-day minute-to-minute basis. its ability to uncover more of what we didn't and don't know , eg. was the earth round, or flat? how to identify a place on the earth globe (using a tuple of longitude and latitude numbers.) But when somebody claiming his is scientific without addressing the above three questions, he is lying, abusing this word, and is exactly being unscientific. hate vs. love This came from a conversation w/ Noah in car. I commented on a bad driver (in my personal perception), and he said he has a word to describe this — fxxx. Certainly I don't want to encourage him using such word. But also it became to me that you need something to describe such a strong feeling . Any human will develop these emotions, and who can really say one emotion is good and another is bad ? I mean, what do you mean by calling it good? Any kid will learn these emotions eventually, and they exist as a matter of fact. You need all of them to live this life. So hate is just another strong emotion that will occur someday. I think the real difference is at handling these emotions. But again, if you view something as negative, you will try to avoid and punish it. So we have anger control, we have don't make war, make love — the underline assumption is that love is better than hate. I found this curious. Not only they are both strong feelings I have argued to be perfectly valid to exist, but also I challenge why hate is a worse feeling than love!? Is it because hate is going to cause more harm to oneself and others? This is a good point I can accept. But then does it mean how much harm is the criteria to judge? Sounds so, then how much harm is ok, or just any harm is bad? and further, harm to whom? What if my hate only harm me? or is there such a thing as an isolated harm, or isolated me ? You see, very quickly this logic is running into a subjective domain that I don't think anyone has a clue. Even further, as we all know the cliche, hate and love are like twins — they feed each other, support each other, and become each other! So really, I don't see hate is being bad at all. It is just a strong feeling that one needs to handle. But the hard question emerges, how to handle!? suppress? limit? encourage? aren't all these already based on a pre-conclusion that these are negative, bad, therefore should be handled with suppression!? I don't know. I feel I'm chasing my own tails. So the conversation with Noah — the F-word is one way to express that strong feeling you feel, but not the only one. The consequence of using it can be a fight. So if you are prepared to fight, go with it, the word itself is perfect fine as it is because it expressed your feeling at the moment well (effective), message clearly understood (no lost-in-translation), and will have the intended result (fight) — man, if only projects at work can be done as such!

Actually I started to find myself always fascinated by early first-person account of China. I have this curiosity of what this country was like, and everytime I read a book like I always found myself keep thinking how similar peopel then to people now, and how unchanged this place has been. This actually bothers me because I think I am being biased against them, that I have already drawn a conclusion and am therefore seeing evidence (and seeking evidence in haystack) everywhere. The conversation between Bea and her Russian pupil is just funny: Speaking of saving for a rainy day, one of my Russians met that expression in his reading the other day, and wanted to know what it meant. I said he might be sick and need money for doctor or hospital. \"But doctors and hospitals are free.\" \"You might want to save to send your child to college.\" \"But all education is free.\" \"Your house might burn up.\" \"The I would be given another.\" \"You might want to travel.\" \"If the government allows me to travel, they will pay my expenses.\" I felt uneasy at the thought of a culture in which there is no motive for thrift, and in which one may not make one's own decision to travel. So even in the time of such, she had an acute sense of disillusion of utopia however well its golden cage may give its captives. But again, I start to wonder whether it is just a matter of choice of life style, like belief, is completly subjective and opinionated.","tags":"thoughts","url":"https://fengxia41103.github.io/myblog/remembering%20china.html"},{"title":"Reader digest life","text":"Teacher: If you have 10 chocolate cakes and someone asks for 2, how many do you have left? Me: 10. Teacher: Okay, well what if someone forcibly takes two of the cakes, how many would you have left then? Me: 10, and a dead body. This thought has been haunting me for a while now since I was listenning to 罗辑思维 while in Shanghai in 2016. I really enjoyed the talks to the point that siqi joked that 罗辑 was becoming my idol. Well, that certainly was not happening and would never happen — I enjoyed it because of the new information of history which I was both familiar with and strange of, partially derived from my deficient formal and self- education on these topics, partially because I never thought of them this way. Nonetheless, I found topics intriguing and fun and had some really good point — the analogy of training passing by a platform as he described how progress of AI will pass human advantages. But anyway, I disliked tremendously when I first watched his annual presentation, which strongly mimiced Steven Jobs and a grand powerpoint. I was disgusted not by the form or the content, but how he was giving credits to those successful business men sitting in honory seats — yes they have done a great job in their own right; no I get it, it's a licking butt, giving face, and a fxxk banquet of an elite club of millionaires. That's not the what I want to talk about in this article. A detour. What really bugs me is the thought of how I am acquiring information and knowledge. On one hand I take pride of myself of being independent thinker, cynical, even over-critical; on the other hand, even with all the books I am reading, I wonder that with the unique view that author is presenting and I'm deep into it at this moment, how do I know which side of the coin I am looking at? If I think people who rely on reader's digest for information is lazy and biased, am I really that different? Isn't what I see and read also just a version of a digest? Even worse, author of the reader digest often than not is a better writer, better analyst, better domain expert, than I am, so his/her view and summary of the book/article/whatever should have a better quality, depth, accuracy, thus a higher density of information, than what I could derive through my own effort. So in this light, me as a person who always to advocate efficiency, is actually taking a path of lower efficiency in acquiring information! Many many times I felt sorry for those upper management who was litening to my presentation. My view is that their channel of information came from my PPT, which truly I feel is just a tunnel view of the subject, even though I honestly wasn't having any intention of manipulating their perception. But it is inevitable. The slides bear a stamp of my perception, and is completly limited to my own way of thinking and understanding — and mine could be well off track from what the truth is. But then, with so many projects going on and so many new technologies, buzz words, subordinates and daily meetings, even by design for their role in work, they have been deprived of having hands-on experience to obtain the level of details that I have. Therefore, they have not choice but to play the managerial pride because that's the only way they could mask their lack of confidence in front of someone who has done the work many times over and know a whole lot of details. But this is pathetic, don't you think? Anyway, from my previous argument, learning from PPT is also more efficient than me studying everything by myself. To think of it, even going to school is an experience of learning from someone's reader's digest, isn't it? Professor had more knowledge and experience with the subject, s/he picked a book, taught us a few things about the subject, and influenced with s/he own personal view of what topic in this field holds a higher priority and excitement. Therefore, learning from reader's digest is not an evil, nor an outlier, but a necessity, a norm, a must. But but, I still have a strong feeling against program like 罗辑思维 when it preached the idea of \"let me read, for you\". This ideology bothers me. I appreciate a venue to learn a summary of a book, even an opinion (or opinions) through such a program. But it being an only, or even an primary information channel, is not healthy I would say. Regardless how well the digest sounds, it is a distilled version, and it is not your version . There is nothing wrong to adopt it as your version if you feel so, but always bear in mind that it is one way to look at things, not The way. More importantly, it should trigger a train of thought that disturbs you more than it gives you anwsers — it demonstrates how ignorant one is (how can I never heard of this before!?), and how ignorant one is about one's ignorance ! I think reading, listening to these digests are fine and a must. But don't stop there. If it is a topic that interest you dearly, dig in, you will be shocked how deep all rabbit holes go. The evil of 罗辑思维 or any digest is when it prints in large font \"all you need to know\" on package — that is not a summarized knowledge anymore, that has become a dose of opium numbing your soul.","tags":"thoughts","url":"https://fengxia41103.github.io/myblog/reader%20digest%20life.html"},{"title":"Best yoda lines","text":"Noah wrote a sheet he titled best yoda line from the clone war .

This is really sad. I think there is something up to her life recently, too — she was not being patient with Noah, actually I would say less patient with him than I do these days even. I don't know. It could be just a period, but then, it's not like her. Then, I got a phone call from our contractor asking about the vanity doors. Honestly I haven't seen them much since they were removed, and have little idea where they are. Yet, just from the conversation I picked up from her this weekend, I had a faint idea of what happened to it, and of course, a phone call verified the hunch. This makes me wonder, why so? and does it matter at all? and why do I get upset? First of all, the matter is such a minor case that it doesn't lend itself to a reason to frustrate. Yes it is an inconvenience; nah, it doesn't hurt things I deem important, the place will come together, the contractor will be a bit upset (but then he is always a bit upset, as a technique I believe), and the harmony or the feeling of peace of mind is certainly more important than a missing vanity door, which is being disregarded anyway. So why do I feel upset, at least at that moment? I think what really upset me, is the thought that this is a case proving my bias that she has a terrible judgement. This is too strong a word and statement, and I feel actually quite uncomfortable with it as I don't even use them on people who really pissed me off. Yet, that's how I feel, about her. I don't know how to describe it, nor having a clear thoughts on what it means. It's a feeling, a confession, an, even I would say a guilty expectation, that she will make such a fall. This is not fair to her at all ! But why can't I check myself when it comes to her case!? I feel I'm just chanting the thought that \"you are wrong you are wrong you are wrong...\" until, as sure as it must be eventually (as anything could possibly be, after all, no one, nothing, is perfect anyway!), she will be wrong — isn't this the same that I always look at China's booming economy with a pessimistic view, until someday it proves this case and I will be like, \"ah ha, I knew it!\" But seriously, this is such a bad way to look at things! This is just, dark! This makes me actively seek for faults in these negative views so to prove the view itself, therefore it becomes a self-fulfilled prophecy! This is just, terrible, unfair. What kind of person am I? But why!? is that because I have already determined her image therefore seeking to prove it? or, taking the China economy as the case, that fundamentally I feel left-out without being benefitted? What if I were the lucky one who came out on top of the ride? Would I still be as biased and unfair as I am today!? Isn't the view that I'm holding against her really roots in the fact that I have lost her on the way but I'm still viewing myself in a light of being worthy having!? What happens if I adjust my own view so that she made the right decision to leave, and I am not worth her time anymore!? But then, who wants to admit that to oneself!? or to live with this view!? Because I think this just leaves to elimination of self-confidence, which then leads to depression, then to, what, death!? If you don't think of yourself worth having, man, that just can't be good. And also, why you want to think that way anyway!? You are not that good, but not that bad either. Objectively speaking, you two are just growing apart. Why being resentful, being unfair, being upset!? I don't get upset much by any stranger having a terrible judgement, why is it different on her case then? Doesn't it mean that I still view her not as another stranger yet? or even worse, I view her as a stranger that is worse than an average one, because I think I know she could have done better? Maybe that's why. Like the frustration logic , it's the false feeling of control and expectation that leads me to this. But then, the only alternative, if a peace of mind is the goal, is not caring anymore. And with Noah and fluffies attached to this relationship, it is an impossibility. So really people get upset about a mistake or an error is that they extrapolate that onto something or someone they actually do care about. If there is a distance between that mistake and the caring target, it becomes pretty easy to visualize that the more extrapolation one does, the more likely it will reach a point touch those target, therefore leading to upset. So with this, I can see that being upset of someone is indeed unfair! You are the one doing the extrapolation. How far you care that logic is completly up to you. The person who has done something, whether good or bad, has no control, but the perception of that act is being depending on your degree of extrapolation now. So it is unfair to blame at all; you already choose to blame and are only seeking evidence to support your conclusion by extrapolation until that act touches something you care. You could have also chosen to stop the extrapolation short, as we often say \"taking the matter as it is\", don't over- extrapolating things. But either way, if one takes a view of an action never in light of how it is going to impact me or someone I care, then, there will be nothing left to be cared about, and one becomes a cold-hearted, souless, walking dead. That's a doom, too. Man, this logic, is actually very depressing, indeed.","tags":"thoughts","url":"https://fengxia41103.github.io/myblog/grownup%20kid.html"},{"title":"Age and maturity","text":"I admire youth. It is a wonderful treasure to have since there is nothing you did to have it, and nothing you can do to retain it. You have it when you have it, then it's gone. But youth is also an awful curse since you are cast into a spell of hope , which is often viewed as a bless, the last straw Gods put into the Pandora's box so to save human from drowning from the evil of chance (but can also be viewed as an evil. go figure.) It's admirable to quote classics and such so support a view you have as if these classics add much credibility and value to your opinion. Yet, I would have to argue that the same statement made by these 老男人 on this show bears sophistication that the junior speaker in his 30s is unlikely to follow and understand — it's cruel (and amusing) to watch the tease, but fundamentally I feel sad that myself has reached the age to appreciate these remarks, and found life and people to be such a messy business that they have lost all the halo of glory — it used to be that people are genuinely good and occasionally bad. No. People are genuinely practical and self-important, and accidentally considerate. That's just, that. Love, expectation I often look at Noah and wonder whether he is an odd case of growing up in a slower pace than my expectation (or my unconscious reference to other kids at this age whom I don't know much about but have drawn an irresponsible conclusion that they behave better or on par to what this age should be . How ridiculous is this statement if I'm looking at myself from a third-party view! So even as much as I'd like to take pride of my reasoning and logical thoughts, I myself fall as victim of being thoroughly irrational, unreasonable, and unfair, to Noah's case at least. So what credit do I have to criticize or comment on others!?). But the truth is, I was acting just like him when I was at this age, and I know too well how he is enjoying being viewed as a little kid spoiled by mom and being the center of attention. He doesn't recognize this, but the feeling is too good to be passed by. And yet, if he is to follow the path I have come along, I know what pitfall he is to have, and how eventually he is to understand of himself (as I think I do of him at this moment) what he is really doing. After all, I believe nowadyas that everyone is living off an image himself or herself is projecting — thus the happiness of being in love is really that you are in love with the projected self who is a state of love, that you are being kind, being generous, being the center of a person's universe, and being appreciated for whatever you do as all intentions are being interpreted in a positive way. Of course, then the projected image does not fade, but the diff between this image and day-to-day actions will start to manifest, therefore fostering disappointment and frustration. A theory on frustration Talking about frustration, I was thinking about this yesterday, and it suddenly occurred to me, that the source of frustration isn't what you expectation isn't satisfied. You could very well expect a thing with your heart and soul, but it doesn't frustrate you a bit if you never feel in a position of having the slightest control of the outcome! Think about buying a lottery ticket, I don't think it's a frustrating experience at all when you lose. The fact that you already know your chance of winning is slim doesn't cancel your secret prayer of winning at all. If we take one step further, frustration is really caused when you think (I know, you think) you know how the situation can be better but turn out not to be ! If you ever think you have put into effort of winning that lottery thus having a level of control of it, well, you will be frustrated. So whenever I feel the frustration towards Noah, it is really rooted in my belief that he could have done better, and he is in the position to make the outcome better. But doesn't it mean that eliminating this belief equals to giving it up — that nothing he could have done, so be it? This sounds not only discouraging, but impractical to execute. One can't give up all level of control; otherwise, one would have been paralyzed to walk in life since daily life consists of millions of decisions one has to make, and the sheer mechanism of making a decision consists of nothing but some sort of confidence/judgement of being in control. Therefore, it is only possible to assume that he is executing with a level of control — thus, I was right to feel frustrated (whenever he forgot his stuff in school, like on the 2nd day of a new semester, and out of the pile of Lost & Found in Wiley at the end of 2017 winter semester, he found two jackets, one sweater — it was just sad sad sad!) Now I guess the question becomes whether I should have assumed him having the control over the things he is not performing well!? That I don't know. It can be easily blanketed by the term of expectation — no expectation, no frustration — and yet, the only possibility of no expectation is when you don't care about it anymore. This is a long iteration towards such a conclusion which have always been obvious. Couples quarrel when they still care to resolve the difference; indifference to each other is a death sentence to a relationship. However, if this logic is sound, it means frustration is a logical outcome of a relationship! This sounds terrible! Isn't that any relationship is then inherently cursed? the cliché, of course, is that the two need to learn to resolve this. But this statement implies that frustration is bad, is a problem, is hampering the health of love. What if we recognize frustration (and same for other emotions, eg. anger, sadness, and so on) in a neutral light that it is just part of human emotions, it exists so to express a particular feeling, like a noun describing this is a cat and that is a dog. There is nothing bad about it, just one emotion you develop in a natural course, and need to learn to use in its context! But what does this mean!? Is frustration then an emotional syntax when I want to convey this feeling to the other person so she can understand what my feeling is? It feels that way. But it also always ties to a pointer of criticism that makes the other person hurt . Because we have said that frustration comes from assumption that one can control the outcome better. Well, the one is either yourself, or the other person, isn't it!? If yourself is in the driver seat, it's up to you to make it better (but it didn't), so you hate yourself; in most cases, it's the other one you feel could have done better, thus this logically leads criticism . There is a third option, that the other one is some God, and this is nothing but saying \"Nah, no one has really the control\", thus leading to fatalism I believe. Therefore, the only non-frustrating relation one can have is that one party is taken as completly incapable ! A pet, a toddler, or what men used to view women in an inferior fashion (but this is just wrong!).... hmmm, interesting.","tags":"thoughts","url":"https://fengxia41103.github.io/myblog/age%20and%20maturity.html"},{"title":"Half the world","text":"Indeed a fascinating book, Where half the world is waking up by [Clarence Poe], a person born in North Carolina writing about China, Japan, Korea and India in the year of 1911. What a view he had!? Certainly I got to learn about what these countries were like — more backwards than I have thought, have been taught to believe, and have ever imagined. It was not the West bullying because they love to bully; it was the East being relatively too weak, so in a simplified game of world dynamics with only two contestants, the West & the East, the winner went to the West (as we conventionally call though I'm also reading another book , in which the author spent pages to articulate and hoped to define the term \"East vs. West\" → therefore, the convention wisdom of the two terms are not nearly as clear as one assumes. On the contrary, they are such a broad brush in a social, historical, even geographical context that the line between them are completly blurred and up for interpretation by whoever is speaking!). Not that the West was being more civilized, advanced, enlightened, knowledgeable, but the East had grown to be primitive (the Korean spade pic ), rigid (Indian's caste system!), and readily positioned itself to be swept away by the wave of development. The only way out of this is not to lock yourself into a belief but to think yourself and to listen and to read as much as you can. Quoting from the book, we are also ready to admit the truth of what Dr. Timothy Richard said to me in Peking last November. \"This revolutionary progress in China has come about,\" he remarked, \"because for twenty years China has been measuring herself with other countries. It is a comparative view of the world that is remaking the empire.\" This echoes again my firm belief that open-mindness , the sheer exposure of multiple angles of views of the same world we live in, makes you think, makes you wonder, make you tremble, with excitement and with fear, make you question what you have been told all along, make you seek explanation none sofar has been satisfying to you, make you put conflicting theories, ideologies, teachings, point of views, voices, opinions, beliefs, interpretations, writings, sacred or not, together into a single entity — yourself — with a struggle to internalize all, bits from some, pieces from another, so to reach a world you yourself can explain, can navigate, can function, can make decisions as if there were a reason, can see the cause as if there were one, can feel confident from time to time, can act as if its intended outcome is predictable, can convince yourself what to and not to do, can convince others what you think is right and wrong, and can hope (if Hope was indeed a savior instead of an evil!) your existence make sense. So reading, thinking, debating, conflicting, is the only way that knowledge (what an abstract term itself is! what is a knowledge!? how do you know you have obtained knowledge ?) can be manifested. Reconciliation is difficult; yet, everyone is a result of reconciliation of all the above, or else s/he will not exist. Contradiction is eternal; consistency is an illusion; consistently contradicting is real. Interesting quotes from the book JAPAN: THE LAND OF UPSIDE DOWN \"I cannot help thinking,\" said one of my friends to me when I left home, \"that when you get over on the other side of the world, in Japan and China, you will have to walk upside down like the flies on the ceiling!\" While I find that this is not true in a physical sense, it is true, as Mr. Percival Lowell has pointed out, that, with regard to the manners and customs of the people, everything is reversed, and the surest way to go right is to take pains to go dead wrong! \"To speak backward, write backward, read backward, is but the A B C of Oriental contrariety.\" Alice need not have gone to Wonderland; she should have come to Japan. I cannot get used, for example, to seeing men start at what with us would be the back of a book or paper and read toward the front; and it is said that no European or American ever gets used to the construction of a Japanese sentence, considered merely from the standpoint of thought-arrangement. I had noticed that the Japanese usually ended their sentences with an emphatic upward spurt before I learned that with them the subject of a sentence usually comes last (if at all), as for example, \"By a rough road yesterday came John,\" instead of, \"John came by a rough road yesterday.\" And this, of course, is but one illustration of thousands that might be given to justify my title, \"The Land of Upside Down,\" the land of contradictions to all our Occidental ideas. That {4} Japan is a land \"where the flowers have no odor and the birds no song\" has passed into a proverb that is almost literally true; and similarly, the far-famed cherry blossoms bear no fruit. The typesetters I saw in the Kokumin Shimbum office were singing like birds, but the field-hands I saw at Komaba were as silent as church-worshippers. The women carry children on their backs and not in their arms. The girls dance with their hands, not with their feet, and alone, not with partners. An ox is worth more than a horse. The people bathe frequently, but in dirty water. The people are exceptionally artistic, yet the stone \"lions\" at Nikko Temple look as much like bulldogs as lions. A man's birthday is not celebrated, but the anniversary of his death is. The people are immeasurably polite, and yet often unendurably cocky and conceited. Kissing or waltzing, even for man and wife, would be improper in public, but the exposure of the human body excites no surprise. The national government is supposed to be modern, and yet only 2 per cent, of the people--the wealthiest--can vote. Famed for kindness though the people are, war correspondents declared the brutality of Japanese soldiers to the Chinese at Port Arthur such as \"would damn the fairest nation on earth.\" Though the nation is equally noted for simplicity of living, it is a Japanese banker, coming to New York, who breaks even America's record for extravagance, by giving a banquet costing $40 a plate. The people are supposed to be singularly contented, and yet Socialism has had a rapid growth. The Emperor is regarded as sacred and almost infallible, and yet the Crown Prince is not a legitimate son. Although the government is one of the most autocratic on earth, it has nevertheless adopted many highly \"paternalistic\" schemes--government ownership of railways and telegraphs, for example. The people work all the time, but they refuse to work as strenuously as Americans. The temples attract thousands of people, but usually only in a spirit of frolic: in the first Shinto temple I visited the priests offered me sake (the national liquor) {5} to drink. Labor per day is amazingly cheap, but, in actual results, little cheaper than American labor. It is amid such a maze of contradictions and surprises that one moves in Japan. When I go into a Japanese home, for example, it is a hundred times more important to take off my shoes than it is to take off my hat--even though, as happened this week when I called on a celebrated Japanese singer, there be holes in my left sock. (But I was comforted later when I learned that on President Taft's visit to a famous Tokyo teahouse his footwear was found to be in like plight.) Speaking of music, we run squarely against another oddity, in that native Japanese (as well as Chinese) music usually consists merely of monotonous twanging on one or two strings--so that I can now understand the old story of Li Hung Chang's musical experiences in America. His friends took him to hear grand opera singers, to listen to famous violinists, but these moved him not; the most gifted pianists failed equally to interest him. But one night the great Chinaman went early to a theatre, and all at once his face beamed with delight, and he turned to his friends in enthusiastic gratitude: \"We have found it at last!\" he exclaimed. \"That is genuine music!\" . . . And it was only the orchestra \"tuning up\" their instruments! BUDDHISM, SHINTOISM, AND CHRISTIANITY IN JAPAN No religion of the Far East has ever recognized the dignity of woman, probably because no religion has ever recognized the worth of the individual. Just as I have said, that in the old days, and almost as largely to-day, in the relations of the home, it was the family that counted and not the individual, so in his relations to the larger world beyond the individual formerly counted for nothing when weighed against the wishes of the superior classes. In the earliest days, when the lord died, a number of his subjects were buried with him to wait upon his spirit in the Beyond. Later, with the same object in view, wives and servants committed suicide on the death of the master. Even now it is regarded as honorable for a girl to sell herself into shame to save the family from want. The same antipodal difference between East and West--here \"the family is the social unit\" and with us the individual himself--explains the system of adoption: a younger son not being essential to the maintenance of the family cult may be adopted into another family, while the eldest son may not. On the same principle the father rules, not because of what he represents as an Individual, but because he represents the Family. Whenever he chooses, he abdicates, and must then join his other children in obeying the eldest son. In the relations of citizenship the same disregard of {56} individual rights was the ancient rule, not merely in the fact that for centuries the smallest details of everyday life were regulated by law, but more seriously in that the Samurai, or privileged class, might \"cut down in cold blood a beggar, a merchant, or a farmer on the slightest provocation, or simply for the purpose of testing his sword,\" while in case of the ruin of their cause it was the honorable and natural thing for soldiers to commit \"hari-kiri\"--that is to say, commit suicide by disemboweling themselves. A Japanese writer recently declared that \"the value of the individual life is an illustration of the Christian spirit\" that is profoundly influencing Japan, and he mentioned as an example that formerly suicide, in such circumstances as I have mentioned, \"was regarded as an honorable act; now it is regarded as a sin.\" Without professing the religion of fatalism which so influences the peoples of the Nearer East, the Japanese soldiers behave like fatalists because the fundamental basis of the social order for centuries has been the necessity of the Individual to sacrifice pleasure, comfort, or life itself when required either by the Family or by the Social Order. And this partially explains why it is said in sober earnest that the highest ambition of most Japanese schoolboys to-day is to die for their Emperor.","tags":"thoughts","url":"https://fengxia41103.github.io/myblog/half%20the%20world.html"},{"title":"Mind","text":"Got a book and it is truly disturbing, Rape of the Mind . So the mind manipulation has been developed to the point that is highly refined, highly scientific (you know I always have reserve about this particular word this days), highly systematic, and highly predictable.

Like how I have analyzed my line of work, psychology has developed framework and divided torture into phases that can be systematically entered through means of physical torture, drug, mental confusion and such. Therefore, all the brutality of torturing on the body isn't just a pain to bear or to yield, but just one step towards a goal that the initiator has a clear definition — in other words, he knows what he is doing, the question is, if you are the one being tortured, do you know what he is doing to you!? Scary, isn't it!? Part of the book will be talking about mind manipulation on the mass, which I have always wondered about. The recent movie 芳华 made the talk of that bizarre age to the headline again, which is often a cliche to my education and my generation, when everybody kinda of shrug shoulder as if it was a bad dream and would not happen again. Yeah, it was just a crazy time done by crazy people. But always, I ask myself, was it? Was it just made possible because of the all the crazy people over excited about their communist future, or it was a demonstration of evil manipulation of the mass, as what this book is talking about? If you were caught in a bad dream, how do you know!? or you just can't know? If so, what's the remedy? I think bad dream happens, so you can't eliminate it. Then what? You get caught and destroyed by it? or is there a way to ID the dream even while you are in it, like that spinning totem in the Inception movie? I never knew the word brain wash was invented by the Chinese (according to the book author). Nonetheless, I firmly believe the act and the thought of braining washing anyone, for however the purpose and agenda, is evil. This come from my underline belief that if there were one thing that is completly free in this world, it is the mind, and to me, guarding its freedom is the last line of defense of humanity. That's why I view the way internet is being blocked in China as a pure act against humanity and society because it is artificially controlling the input to your mind so to achieve a controllable output — this is setup of a social lab, and I don't want to be in it. But reading the western philosophy make this even worse. To some views, the mind is not free, it doesn't even exist. We can be just in the dream, and there is nothing wrong with that. Dream isn't an illusion, and illusion isn't necessarily bad either. It's just, that. Descarte's I think therefore I am is neither sufficient nor correct, because it implies a causal relationship which he didn't want, so he changed it to I am, I exist . How fascinating! I admire these thinkers who made reasoning to explore these concepts. It doesn't really matter which conclusion they have, I think the act of thinking and reasoning is the cornerstone of humanity and being. Sitting here watching Noah finally got to play his minecraft game, I wonder, even it's a fantasy world he is building and is into at the moment, he is creating (a fuzzy pixel house), a world of his own, that reflects what his mind has, his reasoning carries, and his like prefers... however unreal this world is, it's a place he can feel, how it is like being free.","tags":"thoughts","url":"https://fengxia41103.github.io/myblog/mind.html"},{"title":"Logic","text":"It amazes me, really, that how many people are conflicting themselves in term of logic in their arguments. Or I should say, everyone, including myself, are constantly in a state of contradicting of ourselves when it comes to explain an opinion or in a discussion to win a debate. How so? So the big news of China's financial world is that Baidu is opening up some kind of online version of a traditional bank, and everybody thinks it is going to rock the money industry because now it has officially married the crown jewel of this era — computer technology. Of course, the marriage carries an army of buzz word ornaments — AI, big data... the scenario is that by collecting consumer data and data crunching, agent shall be able to improve efficiency dramatically in deciding whether one should get a loan approval or not, which, if realized as what they say, is certainly a huge advantage over the status quo — Chinese state-owned banks are notorious in treating their customers badly by being low efficient and arrogant. From my own experience, both as an employee and as a customer, the understanding of what data is and what one can do with it is just not there. Yes they collect a huge amount of private data, but at the mean time these data are dis-organized, arbitrarily designed and decided — guilty as charged, I was one of those who actually designed application form that our loan customer has to fill out for dollar amount up to millions (!!), while I had literally zero experimental proof of any of those data points could be effective, or even correlate in one way or another!? Even worse, the VP of the bank had strong opinion of his own so the form also incorporated many of his wishes while his only defense is that it has been used in banking industry for years or that he had good experience with it — all subjective, all what I say against yours, and I win because I'm the boss , kind of deal → so that's how the wheels went. I'm super-surprised how well these banks are doing according to their official paper, while its internal is such a mess. Oh well. Back to the topic. Universally everybody thought Baidu stepping into the financial world is a big news, even as yet another example that these tech companies — Alibaba, Tencent, are transforming themselves into something closer to money. Why? Because the core of the argument is that by looking at the same type of entity in the US market, who has about 10% of all financial transaction volume, China has only 0.2% currently → therefore, we are looking at 50x growth just to catch up . But wait!!! This is what bothers me now . You can't have both True First of all, where is the voice of familiar Chinese charateristics now!? Don't people always think that their market is so unique (from the rest of world) that it expects, deserves, a special treatment, a Chinese version!? How come all of sudden what US market is now a benchmark? This isn't an isolated case. Taking any marketing PPT when the first couple pages talks about an industry, a business model, there is always the logic that whatever the 先进国家 has (or had), it represents a self-proven projection of what the topic (and PPT author's view) will have. Don't you see!? This is completly contradicting to what they will inevitably derive just a few pages later, now the old cliché that \"oh btw, China is different that you just don't understand it as well as I do, and there is a new, modified, custom-made version, just for China, and look how smart I am, how business savvy I am, and how接地气 I am\". Give me a fxxx break!!! This is completly BS, and the frustration I have is that s/he doesn't realize how BS s/he is being! What I'm hearing are two assumptions as the basis of their logic: I have an apple, and you have an orange. Because orange grows 10 lb/piece, my apple will grow to 10 lb/piece, too. Excuse me!? You can have one of these two points, but not both. You can't make projection withiout distinction Secondly, if the business (model) are indeed the same in core — online or not is just a form, the core of banking, the logic of banking — I'm talking about transactional logics and details, do your due dilligence — they should still be viewed in at least two segments — a fixed-value segment and a variable-value segment . Fixed-value segment : covers attributes and transactions that are universally true and can be confidently applied in parallel, for example, how interest rate is calculated, how accounting books are made, how tax is done... really, people, please stop being creative in this segment, read the rules written by authority and educate yourself to be a domain expert on these. These are blank & white, and should be understood like 2*2=4 — everybody works on the same syntax and rule. Variable-value segment : covers these local opinions and customs that are society driven, psychology driven, and human-need driven. So the homework here is to gain an insight of these factors, and without me even says, these topics are hard !! I wouldn't even dare to claim there is science behind them. There are studies and professors, but really, human business is just messy. It's difficult to profile a person, let alone to predict a behavior. There are patterns when samples are large, but individual is a wildcard. So what I'm trying to derive from this? is that only the fixed values are transportable and can be used in a projection. The variable segment requires a delibrate analysis with a clearly defined point of view (yes, you are required to take a stand so all the analysis has a foundation. Otherwise, it's meaningless.) and framework so to support your opinion, and like any subjevtive POV it's very much up for debate and challenge (but at least it is clear to all that it is a subjective POV, not an objective fact, and that is a core difference). But omitting it as if it is a universal knowledge without a need of explanation is just a coward action showing that you don't understand it either, and that defeats the whole logic of the my apple will grow to 10 lb/piece just because their apple grows to that big, too. No!! If your division of fixed vs. variable is 20%-80%, I would only accept that there is 20% of a chance your apple will grow to their size, certainly not 100%. Period. You see, this is how logic should be, be logical, and be consistent. Sigh Too many times now, in too many occasions, and by too many dressed-up experts and talk shows, the two contradicting views are being presented and mingled to support a single argument, which fundamentally is saying: \"Look, I flip a coin and both faces are up!\" This line is indeed impressive (as its speaker is hoping to sound). As a matter of fact, it must be impressive, it has to be impressive, because this is absolutely magical! It is absolutely magical because, it can not logically happen. That's all.","tags":"thoughts","url":"https://fengxia41103.github.io/myblog/logic.html"},{"title":"Hurt feelings","text":"This is a tough one, really, cause I have been puzzled by this topic for the last five years, and am continuing being puzzled by it without a resolution. I don't know how to resolve this. But it is definitely an issue of me that I need to understand, to fix (if it can be), and to do better without this. Here is the situation: someone close to you said she was hurt, by you, maybe a remark, a move, something. And here is the dilemma. On the one hand, I think no one can control how another person feels, therefore it is simply not sensible to project the result of the perception — you may make the perfect conversation with a golden heart, there is simply nothing stop it being perceived as a vicious attack with a dark intention. So, does this make it completly unrelated between your behavior and others' reactions? In other words, if each is responsible for his/her own feelings, do I just get a jail-free card to be a jerk? Certainly, it should not be this way. But on the other hand, one can't be responsible for others, at least not as adults. I mean, really, only you can make yourself happy, or sad, or whatever, no one else can. If not, it becomes a scary thing, because think of all the brain wash remarks I have heard in my education, in my experience working with Chinese elites, when all they were crafting was to lead the customer ← isn't the underline message of this is that fxxx you, I am telling you what is good or bad because first of all, you don't know, secondly, I am superior to you!? This is just, so, wrong!!! But if you speak with a projection of how the other person is to perceive and to react, doesn't it make your saying a form of this manipulation? What is the difference? Yes one can argue that one is with a good intention, and one is deliberately manipulative. But well, how do you define \"good\"? Isn't itself a subjective matter that what is good from your point of view is, again, a poison for me, because I perceive that way!? Dont you see, this argument becomes circular. So what is a right thing to do, to say, to behave, to act, so you don't hurt others? and should you care, if it is out of your control, and as being good intention as you want, shouldn't you also avoid manipulating others' perception, even if it is positive (and helpful)? Well, if you can make a positive impact, wouldn't it by definition also make you in position to make bad and negative ones, intentionally and unintentionally!? I don't know. I feel this logic goes round and round without an ending, and sometimes I feel I'm paralyzed by it. I feel the sensible thing, if at all, is to be honest to yourself and to the othe person, be sincere at the moment of your do and say, speak from your inner belief, and live on. If others find you positive, great; if negative, they are not for you and you are not for them. I think this is the only possible outcome, that people love you, love you; people don't, don't. I have always argued that love is not given by the other person. It is a creation of yourself — you make yourself feel the love. When you are in love, any \"flaw\" becomes a virtue, any cumbersome becomes a thrill and cuteness; when love is gone — I don't believe person changes much, if at all, at least the primary attributes simply don't change (even if you really want them to, you will be suprised how stubborn they are) — it's not the person who has gone bad, it's you who have changed point of view, the same traits that used to be wonderful and cute, now is ugly or intolerable. So along this line, I think at the end of day, you can't be responsible for others' feeling, you are in control of your own, whether it is love or anything else. You can hurt others, even if you are sincere and truthful, because perception is something you don't have control, and should not try to control. In my opinion, controlling is a far worse version than hurting someone on purpose → the former is lying, the latter is a claimed war so at least you know what you are dealing with. I don't know. I feel that I'm promoting open confrontation over articulated social behavior. I'm not. I am just preferring truthfulness over any form of disguise, however pretty and beautiful it may seems for the time being. But then, I was told (by urban legend), that woman always prefers the disguised version even she knows it is not true. Huh? I'm puzzled, and continue being so.","tags":"thoughts","url":"https://fengxia41103.github.io/myblog/hurt%20feelings.html"},{"title":"Love, life","text":"I'm in the middle of this mid-life crisis, I guess, which prompted me to think a lot about why I am feeling this, whether this is happening for a reason, that it is just unique to me, or to everyone in a way, just different content? If it's the latter, then it's just like a phase in growing up, that sooner or later one will experience it → it's the process driven by nature, not by my mind, which I always fear is going crazy, sometimes. I mean, being unique is what everybody wants, but being unique is also what gives you anxiety — you want to be part of a social team (so you don't feel left out), but you also want to be standing out, uniquely you, being taken that way, that you are someone special . How conflicting! This is like everything else in life, that two sides of a coin are fighting but must co-exist, all the time, and inside one body, one brain, one person! I used to think oxymoron is an exceptional mind game or word game that's fun to play with, as a joke. But nowadays, I think it is not even funny; it is the normal. Scary. So, I was thinking about love, why two ppl fall in love with each other, why the feeling of love can fade, say, in marriage, and too often than we want it to, it not only fades, but flips to become an agony, an annoyance, a piece of you that upsets you, makes you mad, frustrated, even hatred. This can't be just a myth, a cliche that marriage is the doom of love, then everybody, young and old repeat generation after generation, partially driven by the mating urge, but in many many many ways by a reflection of so called ideal self & life you have in mind. When young I used to think breaking up was due to a misunderstanding of your partner, \"can't you see how much I love you!? can't you see how good I am!? can't you see what you are missing out (by not being with me)!?....\" If one ever take a step back to look at these comments, the only conclusion to draw is, man, this is one self-centered man/woman! and who wants to be around someone like that!? I think they did the right thing by leaving me. Really, I would have made the same decision, because the person who thought that way is just not lovable, at all. But then, I start to ask, why I had thought that way? Was that because of the age, that all young people are self-centered (and of course, the younger you are, the more it is, just think of Noah, who was SUPER self-centered when he was like 3-month, to like a 3-4 year. Man, he couldn't care less of what the world is doing. He wanted his milk bottle, now! So it is a phase thing!? so can one grow out of it ? When? in his 80s? or 40s, like what I'm going through as I'm typing these?), or it was happening for a reason? I mean, why one feels self-important that way!? I think there is much self-confidence involved, that one truly think s/he is lovable, priceless, has much to give to the other party, and has the strength to bring an image of life and self in reality. Sometimes when I sit by Starbucks watching young people coming in and out, I can't help feeling that besides the nature's calls, there is a fundamental logic that one likes (and likely to fall in love with) these beautiful young people, and here is how it goes. phase 1 Love life, phase 1 When you are young, how can you not be lovable !? Just look at the life around you. Yourself is healthy, having an endless potential. Your parents are young enough and likely to contribute to your life rathe than being a responsibility. You have an army friends who share a very similar life (& styles) like you. You all have similar worries and happinesses. You have quite a few suitors who adore you, so you feel loved, needed, special (even though you may not like them back). This is a version of life's image everyone would like to have, isn't it!? The only drawback one says about this is that young people may be poor. But, if you are not in the poor category, then life is literally, wonderful! So how can I not love someone like you!? You have everything to be loved! phase 2 Then, there is phase 2. A bit older now, maybe married, maybe dating, 5-10 years into a career of some sort, have formed a few deeper understanding of the job, of boss and co-worker, of people and life in general, hurt a few times by someone, hopefully not fatal and mentally fatal, have moments of doubts and downs ofteners than before. The killer problem starts to show — if married, there maybe a kid, oh man, parenting is just, HARD! or a few marriage/dating glitches now and then, not quite sure the one you love or the life is coming up, parents are aging and you start to see some effect of it, grandparents are aging, too. And the worst thing is, friends start to drive in different pace now, some getting ahead, some lingering (as you always feel you are the one), some falling behind (but you feel you are not that much better than them), some already has kid in 3rd grade, while others are dating to get married, and you are just somewhere in between, of all these. The down spiral, sigh. Love life, phase 1 sad, sad, sad I think you get the idea. Life is becoming more and more of things you need to take care of — parent, grandparent, kids, job, partner, frustration of yourself, of seeing some of your friends/peers are getting ahead, a few what-ifs one start to ponder, an urge to find a shortcut so to get back the loss , and on and on and on. This is sad. And if you think of it and ask yourself, would you love someone like this? If you are being with this person, your sphere of problems and responsbilities have just expanded. So for a love between adults, it is a serious commitment to take on these, to make his/her problem, mine. Let's face it, the reality is, these challenges don't go away when you say \"I love you\". They persist, until you find a way to handle it → this is the same that saying those buzz words are easy and fun and blood-pumping, making a version of that buzz word reality, however minute and preliminary that version is, is hard. thoughts So, I'm not crazy after all. The feeling of struggle is not only real, but logical. The task to tackle these things in life just can't be an easy decision. It's only rational to feel the gravity of it and be fearful of how much work it is going to take. Those who think these are easy, just like the ones I always criticize on those Chinese tech shows, or someone how think technology is mature , the truth is, they want someone else to solve these for him/her , because they certainly won't.","tags":"thoughts","url":"https://fengxia41103.github.io/myblog/love%20life.html"},{"title":"A vain debate pattern","text":"I am amazed, that 财经郎眼 I used to enjoy so much which kept me on tap with China's economic progress and debates, is nowadays plagued with a BS culture and discussion pattern that I have witnessed , criticized, hated (no I don't hate this program, just the cliche amplified by this 11/6/2017 episode on 新能源车 变革未来 .) Where should I even start? The topic was about a new Chinese policy that is to obsolete gasoline car and promote electric cars. What bugs me is the fact that no one, I mean no one, on the show and involved in this discussion said anything about efficiency of energy conversion. They all stated the easy opinions , environment protection, green life, obsoleting old technology (and really!? who said, or proved, that gasoline car is an old technology? Isn't it again stated with an underline assumption of mature technology ?), and how we, China, could yet again lead the next wave in technology, and automobile has long been seen as the symbol of the start of America's industrial dominance — the high gear version of a terrible system called capitalism. So we could lead the march to a new form of automobile, wow, that's like another God's sign posted on the side of the road says, \"yes you are the one, you are made to replace America as #1. Look, you are replicating his success! so that must be on the right path.\" Geee!!! Come on people! When you are so hung up on the idea that critical path to success in electric car is battery technology, and throwing in a few lines that government should step in to build infrastructure so there is charging station available for drivers' convenience, it pisses me off in a number degrees beyond frustration. battery's power is not, free First of all, yes battery is the critical path. But no, let's take one step further on this → the key issue here is not about battery vs. gasoline , it is electricity vs. gasoline . In other words, it is really a comparison of two super duper complicated industries: power station + transmission + battery + engine oil + transmission + combustion + engine So to comprehend the benefit (or con) of either side, one needs to consider the whole nine yard of electricity generation from coal, hydraulic power, wind, solar, nuclear, to a heated water pump that drives a GIANT engine in an power plant, all the way to that little tiny bit locked inside your battery, versus a completly similiar breakdown of technology chain but using, transporting a different material. If you ever study high school physics, energy is constant, just different form. People are talking about the power stored in battery as if it came for free!! Nuts! The electrical power came from somewhere, and there is a cost associate with it, and I'm not talking about the cost of $0.50 per watt you pay on your electricity bill, I'm talking about this industrial supply chain that convert a raw material to a form that will drive the wheels. So really, regardless which material to choose from, it's the efficiency of this chain matters, not the last link of battery! In other words, if you suck in the current chain (which, as matter of fact, is a lot mature than the one you are proposing), then your odds of doing well in the new chain is pretty slim, too. Even to the extent of these people's favourate argument to support electric car — green. Well, the true comparison has to be an aggregation of power station pollution versus. oil refinery pollution, for the least. And you know what, don't we all agree that both are nasty, equally evil, industry, that no one wants to have it in his backyard!? If so, how can you just throw in a buzz word (again, I hate people using buzz word like this!) and think all the old problems would now go away!? No, they will not go away, unless you address them diligently and efficiently . Otherwise, I can bet that you are just swapping one set of problems with another, just that the other set you don't know much about yet ← this is truly an example of the happiness of the ignorance ! Same gravity Second, can you just drop the fantasy of the 中国玩法!? This is absolutely a conspiracy theory now that just because the US and Europe lead the technology race (as of today), so anything business model or standard or theory must be inherently bad for China, so and so that China has to control its own destiny by leveraging their lust for its market to come up a new game rule!? Does it make you feel safe now!? Really, I can understand in many levels why a country wants to do that, but one should also admit there are fundamental principles that apply to all human, all societies. I seriously wonder that rolling back a few hundred years should China also acclaim that its gravity is very different from 9.8 thus Newton's laws just don't apply!? Get a grip! There is a reason why western is leading the technology race — it had a first mover advantage, of course, but truly it's the attitude of being practical, being critical, and less BS that give them the advantage. Especially when we face the question of efficiency, science, technology, really, there is one set of physics rules that are universally true, and one should continue to challenge it, to test it, to gain better understanding of it so to find out when it falls short. But having a moral cry with excitement that \"look, the new Chinese way!\", is just fxxxx BS. Be conservative I have observed this pattern many times over that is crazily prevalent in China and its elite circle these days. I call it the view of being a competitor rather than being a contributor . China elites keep thinking in term of a race and competition in which winner takes it all. They should instead think how their experiments and trials could help to eliminate unknown path and to contribute to the pool of this overall interesting, seemingly beneficial, and humanely progressive topic. If they truly believe in the future of a wide adoption of this technology that can make people's life better, they should be extremely critical of its risk and problems, because if you truly care about people, you don't see shinning $$ signs or benefits written all over, you see how painful and struggling someone's life can be affected, and how agonizing that will be to one's soul, to yours. Leave government alone Last, the baby cry that government should step in to do this, do that. I think any idea is going to fly if the government steps in to build an infrastructure for you, to eliminate tax, to ban all your competitors, and so on.... this is baby talk! Chinese business people are not entrepreneurs at all, they want government backup for EVERYTHING! Who doesn't like a risk free business!? I know I will. But then, don't label yourself pioneer, or business man, or innovator... you are not! You are not even a follower. You just want both, 当了婊子还要立牌坊, disgusting! Put those charging stations as a sunk cost on your budget sheet, if you have one, factor in tax benefits and potential loss, hone in your development and production to make quality, efficient product, fight your competitors till one is dead, and accept a lost battle with grace and regrets that there were many many points you could have done better, differently, that may have changed the outcome. Then, if given a chance, try again, if that's still your passion to do. But mixing your grand, wonderful business plan with a line saying government should have prepared the stage for me... well, then I already know you will point a finger to the government also when it doesn't work. It's just convenient, and honestly, you didn't believe this so called great stuff yourself either, you just want to profit off others' belief.

I don't even know how to translate this line.) bothers me a LOT! What do you mean by that? There are loads questions to be clarified, don't you think!? that the technology has already been developed? that can be easily copied and re-implemented, with the same wonderful results? or has been in existence for a while and everybody in the room understands what it means, and what it takes!? Are we talking about the principle of this technology here? or a version of implementation? or some other customized idea based on it? and how do you know it works for you in your application context? Have you done a POC? and to what degree your POC was built and tested and proven to give you confidence? How far apart is your POC from what you envision of the real thing? How did you derive that conclusioin? Really, whenever ppl use such a vain, vague, meaningless line as to set the theme of a discussion, it is nothing but a grand title that leads to nowhere and a unmistakened signal of wasting time on everybody involved on the thread, regardless the topic and actual fact. Truth told, the speaker or the writer just has zero clue of what the technology really means, how it works, how it is implemented, what quirks s/he has experienced and is aware of, how these quirks are going to impact what you are thinking to achieve with this technology... the list can go on and on and on. The bottom line is, there isn't such a thing as mature technology . There is known implementation of it; there is successful case (and failure cases in that matter) of it; there is probably many many theories and diagrams about it developed from multiple dimensions of viewing angle so to have an interpretation of it; there is so called best practice (even this term has been completly abused in context of a technical discussion) of certain aspects of it derived from accrued experience by others who have treaded on this path before and attempted a few things here and there while one is easier/harder than another. But the way people (bogus tech experts) commonly put this line forward, is really implying one huge assumption that this worked before, and I can find someone to replicate this result. Really!? Should we then list some counter example just to make a point? Computer architecture. Since its birth, its architecture has always been: a compute unit (CPU), memory (for transitional data), storage (for data persistence), and data bus (for data transportation). Every single electronic device that we know of today follows this exact architecture (in its most general term). Yes it is a mature design and widely adopted, understood, practiced, and used. Yet, Intel can do it doesn't mean you can do it. If someone standing on a stage and starts saying \"this is a mature technology, and I'm going build a computer of XYZ to make it the fastest or the most powerful of computer on earth\", forget it ← no, it is a mature design, probably, but there are million dials to make it work, and having a architecture diagram at hand shows nothing of its possible implementation path and its pitfall. If you are the first time doing it, you will fail, 100% of the time. Like everything else in life, if you never practiced it before, your odds of striking gold on the first try is, and should be, zero . So please, don't quote examples of Google whenever you talk about AI or the best technology company; don't quote Amazon whenever the topic is about e-commerce or supply chain; don't quote Alibaba or Tencent whenever it's about Chinese tech ruling the world... because, like a personal success story, the true capability of the company or the business contribute to less than 10% of what it achieved. It's the other 90% that has no theory, no diagram, no roadmap, no recipe, and impossible to replicate. Period. Besides, duplicating the exact growth path doesn't guarantee a 1-to-1 copy of their status to you, either. Not to mention, technology, is really a particular mindset, a view of the world and a understanding of the issue, yours against mine. The difference is not in which tech stack to use. It's in the way we each build a logic, to do analysis, evaluation, and to battle trench wars of the old saying of devils being in the details , and to make decisions along the trial-and-error.

It's rather surprising how recent these events were — we are talking about the mid-19th century, what, about 150 years ago? In prospective, the history of Egypt and its glorious monuments have been around for much longer than that. reality of the past What really bothers me, however, is how the people at those days were treating these ancient artifacts back then — just like the horror propaganda I have been told about China's treasure being looted and trashed by barbarians of both foreign and domestic origin (and admittedly much more by the domestic ones), the same theme of sadness was playing in Egypt, over and over and over again. Pyramids were used for quarrying building materials, and artifacts were given as a token to influential whoever the ruler was trying to please. At the end of the day, no one was looking at them as arts of unreplaceable value. They were free gifts left over by ancient anonymous — cheap as dirt, and only meaningful to one when it could bring glory, fame, profit, or the things s/he wants at that given moment. There was no perpetual value, no inherited value, certainly no emotional value worth preservation, and much less of responsible value by making them available for the generations to come → consume and dispose them now, by me, period. \"unfairness\", in a hindsight But then, if you feel it is clear now to see how terrible those deeds were, I kept wondering how to justify this view when I'm really reading all these from a distant present , or to say looking from a rear view mirror. I hold a different prospective than those in the book at the time. You can call it a progress of civilization as we are now understanding more of its history (since no one was even able to read the Egyptian words till the Rosetta stone , and even that took a few decades before it was deciphered), thus its importance and value. But does it state that it's not fair to those people we call barbarians these days since they were really operating in a disadvantage comparing to what we know today? Well, then why being fair is a measure of good or bad anyway? who said it must be fair ? If you throw these out, then how does one look at so called history and opinionate it one way or the other? After all, each holds his own life experience as the only foundation he could relate and refer to. So it becomes a completly random chance that someone's reference happens to match the one that later gets realized and is labelled as a human progress , which then leads them standing out as the pioneer and a great mind, while in reality, who the heck know what it is going to be tomorrow!? right of the advanced Further, when western museums were the buyer who drove all the tomb robbers and antique traders, the sad reality back then was that local folks didn't give a fxxx of all the mummies and monuments. So now fast forward 150 years, it is just not reasonable to blame them for collecting them in the name of loot or steal . Their argument is valid — the antiques did have a better chance to be preserved and to survive, and they did have a better vision (if can be called enlightened) of the future than others. But this leads to another dilemma. Does it then mean that a so called advanced group or society should be in position to take over things from a less advanced group so to maximize the overall benefits of, what, society? human race? history?... I don't find a word to describe this. But you see what I'm driving towards right? This argument definitely feels, not right morally, but right factually. Let's say we let them do that, and the future proves they were right ← both of these are pretty SIGNIFICANT assumptions. But does it mean that the less advanced group will be locked in their inferior position/class forever? If I enjoy the benefit of taking over others' stuff, what incentive do I have to educate them and lift them up out of their existence so to compete with me!? Isn't this the exact thought any privileged subject has and wish to maintain, forever!? So the elites rule us all, because even you are the privileged one, chances are you are not the single top guy of the food chain, then by this reasoning it derives that you will also be ruled, crashed, bullied, and wasted, maybe just with a slight less degree of destruction, but the idea is the same. Well, then why do you want to promote that!? history === myth How confusing! I think this whole mess of arguments really lead to the problem that there is no compass in my life these days and the line between right and wrong is completly blurred (or just disappeared). I lost faith in the future, has serious contempt of the present, and has a shaky feeling of the past. Santayana warned that \" Those who do not learn history are doomed to repeat it.\" But what you learned from history isn't really a truth or even fact, but a hindsight of judgement which itself could just be a complete wrong in the next few decades because of the prospective shift. Then, what could one really learn from so called history, if anything? 马未都说：\"历史没有真相，只残存一个道理\". Now even this seems over optimistic. There isn't even a 道理, just a story, a legend, a myth. So to this point, history doesn't really matter much, nor it has any value in anything. Its left over artifacts are valuable, when they have a market (which means someone wants it for $$). If no one wants it, oh well, they are just a whole pile of dirt regardless what they are named, mummy, gold, or whatever. \"Epilogue\" I am quoting the \"epilogue\" chapter of the book , which I feel draw a clear picture of paradox of history that barbarians whom we so disgust today, who looted the Niles with selfish motivation ONLY, in the end became the driving force, though brutal and even uncivilized judged by these days' standars, created a repository of treasure, even unintentionally, so we living in this century still have some to look at and to admire. If left to the rightful owner of them (the locals, but who said they have the right?), many we see today would have been long gone, consumed as a trivial heating bundle in winter and supersititious medicine, whose usage and purpose we scorn even more I suppose, comparing to their dark fate of being moved from their origin to a foreign location as monument, as cash machine, as a ladder to fame and fortune for some, but in the end, as an inheritage of mankind. Over a hundred and fifty years have passed since Giovanni Belzoni shook the dust of Alexandria off his feed for the last time. But many familiar scenes would greet his eyes if he were to return to the Nile today. The pyramids still tower above the floodplain, while the Sphinx crouches at their feed surrounded by curious tourists. The sun still rises in a gray dawn, lights up the vast spaces of the desert, and highlights the fertile green and cultivated land by the banks of the Nile. The shimmering heat of midday embraces the heavy air of temple and royal bomb in the same way that it has for centuries. White-sailed river vessels retrace the course taken by Belzoni's ramshackle boats and pass the scenes of this greatest exploits. There is a sense of timelessness about the Nile that transcends the passage of years or the stirring events of history. The visitor to the Nile can smell the same smells as the Ancient Egyptians, of hot dust and damp reeds, of the river itself as it flows smoothly toward the north. Every year, like clockwork, the Nile comes down in flood, ensuring the fertility of crops and perpetuating agricultural practices that are often little modified from pharaonic times. One can almost sense that elusive feeling of equilibrium and ma′et, that sense of rightness so highly prized by the Ancient Egyptians as they identified with their unchanging environment. Belzoni had come to the Nile at a time when the full extend of the glories of Ancient Egypt had just been revealed to the world for the first time. The coolections of Napoleon's savants had electrified the scholars of Europe and a craze for things Egyptian had swept the cultivated drawing rooms of European capitals. The Rosetta Stone had reached the British Museum; the Louvre in Paris had just unpacked its spoils from the Nile. A surge of nationalistic lust for the precious and exotic was filling these museums and those in other countries with all manner of curiosities and the finest artistic achievements of Western civilization. And Egyptian antiquities were at the top of the curators' shopping lists. Thus the scramble for Ancient Egypt began, a campaign of looting conducted in the name of diplomacy and leisured cultural inquiry, which soon degenerated into an orgy of destruction, greed, and outright profiteering. As in other parts of the world, archaeology began as treasure hunting and then slowly evolved into a scientific discipline armed with all the specialist methods and techniques of the twentieth-century fieldworker. But by the time the scientific archaeologist arrived, much of the Ancient Egypt was gone forever, devoured by the voracious maw of the treasure hunter, unscrupulous collection, or curious tourist. Napoleon's mena were only human in their desire to collect Egyptian antiquities, for the urge to collect and posses is one of the more passionate of human desires. Time and time again the early archaeologist was overcome with a passion to excavate, loot, or just remove the past to another place, where he could caress it and contemplate its glories without the disturbing qualities of its original context. Soon European antionalism and the petty ambitions of dislomats and statesmen became involve in the collecting business, as many nations sought to acquire a fine repository of the most beautiful, exotic, and valuable manifestations of Ancient Egyptian civilization. It became fashionable to be knowledgeable about Ancient Egyptin all its nostalgic and fascinating glory. Egypt was the epitome of ancient civilization, that of a strong and powerful society that had oppressed the Israelities, suffered from the Mosaic plagues, and taken a conspicuous place in the established order of world history. Unfortunately, knowledge coincided with ownership and profit in many people's minds. In a sense one cannnot blame the museum curator or collector of a century and a half ago for the attitudes that they possessed. Everywhere they looked they saw statuary and temples being broken up and tombs being looted for jewelry. In Egypt nothing was safe. But a papyrus carefully unrolled in the secluded comfort of the British Museum was safe from destruction, cushioned with the awesome security of the greates museum in the world. After all, as Wallis Budge pointedly remarked, a mummy displayed in the British Museum was very priuvileged compared with his cousins in the looted tombs of Thebes. No on could desecrate a British Museum mummy or tear it apart. The outrageous tactics of private purchase and surreptitious excavation in definance of authority were condoned in the comfortable certainty that they were the only practicable way to save Ancient Egypt from extinction. What need, asked many people, did the Egyptians have for their past? After all, the pasha's government was destroying and giving it away all the time. And the fellahin seemed to have no respected for tomb or temple or any identity with the Ancient Egyptians themselves, only in the value of their corpses. There was non of the local nationalistic sentiment that had stirred vigorous public outcry in Greece when Lord Elgin removed the marble friezes that bear his name in the British Museum from the portico of the Parthenon. The well-heeled museum collection and tourist of a century and a half ago was fully aware that the Ancient Egyptians themselves had helped themselves to the contents of royal tombs. They had viuolated their most sacred places and the royal sepulchers for gold and a guaranteed source of wealth that would enable them to meet life's day-to-to needs. The ancients had treated the past with a causal cynicism that had been inherited by their successors, a cynicism that was mathed with equal contempt by the nineteenth-century collector. It is a miracle that anything at all has survived for us to enjoy. Without question, however, much of Ancient Egypt's magnificent splendor was saved from oblivion by the aggressive policies of Wallis Budge and other — witness, to mention only a few instances, not only Belzoni's collections, but also the Papyrus of Ani, the best and most complete version the Book of the Dead, and the thousands of Coptic manuscripts in the Louvre and the British Museum. By displaying their acquisitions, the officials of major European museums, however unscrupulous their methods, made possible a heightened awareness of the need to learn about Ancient Egypt and to save it for proterity before it all vanished forever. Fortunately, when one looks back over the history of Egyptology one views a landscape peopled by giants. Jean Francois Champollion and John Gardner Wikinson unlocked the secrets of hieroglyphs. August Mariette excavated for the Louvre and then became the first jealous guardian of Ancient Egypt for serious scholar and tourish alike. Flinders Petrie introduced modern excavation methods to the Nile. The genius of Champollion and the passionate vagor of Mariette resulted in the gradual creation of an organization designed to thwart destruction and inevitable oblivion. Egypt became the first Near Eastern country to possess a national museum, even if it began life as a ramshackle shed in a back garden in Cairo, and even if its contents were occasionally donated to influential visiting dignitaries. Gradually the diplomats turned from antiquities to political activities, while more and more people came to look rather than loot. Egypt itself became an interesting place to visit, with the great pyramids and temples as part of a backdrop for a thoroughly entertaining vacation. In a sense, it was the tourist and the educated dilettante who saved Ancient Egypt. Egypt's first Antiquities Ordinance was promulgated in 1835 and was largely ignored by those it sourght to control, for there were no mechanisms or facilities to enforce it. Ironically, it was the looted antiquities in European museums that caused a rising tide of public opinion to react against the orgy of destruction. People had admired the fine statuary in the Louvre, felt that such fine achievements belonged to the world at large and that everyone had the right to enjoy them. There was a slow realization that fanatics like Mariette were correct, and that the flaboyant director of the Bulak Museum was right to offend the covetous Empress Eugenie with here imperious demands. Besides, tourism was good business for everyone: for the properity of foreign trade, for European political interests in the near East, for the Egyptians, and for the tourists themselves. How could there be any tourism if there were no temples, tombs, or museum collections for the visitor to admire? The studied logic and efficient bureaucracy of Britical rule in Egypt finally created, albeit slowly, a change in public attitudes within Egypt itself. Amelia Edwards journeyed through Egypt at the beginning of a long period of relative political stability, when the Antiquities Service began to develop a network of guards and active intelligence agents employed to prevent illegal collecting and the further rape of Ancient Egypt. Of course, there were incidents of scandalous corruption and brazen tomb robbing, some of them associated with respectable museums, but the tilde of public attitude and archaelogical morality had turned imperceptibly in favor of preservation and scientific excavation. Even those who chose to paint their names on the great temples were publicly excoriated for their conspicuous sins. It became harder to remove antiquities from Egypt and more fashionable to consider the Cairo Museum as one of the foremost repositories for Ancient Egypt in the world, a museum soon to be staffed by Egyptians themselves. The stolid facade of the British Empire fostered a risiging sense of nationalism in Egypt, ad elsewhere, a latent resentment of foreign rule and British imperialism, a greater identity with the long and fascinating kaleidoscope of history that the Egyptians could look back upon. This nationalism manifested itself in political events, which are familiar to us all, but also in an abhorrence of a \"cultural imperialism\" that chose to remove the choicest achievements of antiquity to foreign climates. The magnificient discovery of the undisturbed tomb of Tut-ankh-Amun in 1922 merely fueled the sentiment against foreign excavation and exploitation of Ancient Egypt, although Lord Carnarvon gave the royal tomb's contents to the Cairo Museum. By the 1920s foreign expeditions were rarely found in Egypt, for there were few rewards for well-financed museum expeditions that depends on rich finds to attract generous benefactors. A long drawn-out stand-off between the acquisitors of major foreign museums and the Egyptian Antiquities Service reflected a hardened attitude, one where sharing of a unique cultural heritage with other nations was morally unacceptable. Few scholars were able to dig in Egypt on the scale that archaeologists like Petrie had regarded as commonplace. It is only recent years that Egypt has opened its doors to foreign archaeologists again, this time on a carefully controlled scale. But now the international climate for archaeology has changed, in a world that is ardently nationalist and increasingly jealous of its diverse cultural heritages. People are far more aware of enormous contribution that the discipline can make to the proper study of humankind. Today, they wealth of Ancient Egypt is spread through the museums of several continents. Mummy after mummy, sarcophagus after sarcophagus, statue after statue, museum storerooms and galleries, are filled with the dusty remains of Egyptian antiquity. Most were acquired by private collectors and then donated to the museums, or acquired in massive field seasons, supported by private donations, where often quantity was more important thant quality. The large expeditions and casual collecting forays of half a century ago have been replaced by an illegal antiquities traffic that feeds on the law of supply and demand and the avaricious acquisition policies of large museums and wealthy collectors. Journalist Karl Meyer has documented this nefarious trade with its long ancestry in the activities of Belzoni and his kind in The Plundered Past , a devastating indictment of the mechanics of the twentieth-century antiquities trade. Meyer describes public consciousness of the seriousness of hte problem as being at about \"stage zero\", for the importantce of archaeology and its significance to humankind is something that is theoretically easy to understand, has been rarely discussed at length in print, and is far harder to comprehend in practice. It is certainly almost impossible to persuade taxpayers to pay for archaeology when the thorny issue of limited resources and ordered priorities comes up. ... The passion ofr collecting dies hard, especially in times of recession or mushrooming art prices. Nor does it perish in the face of attitudes like those of New York art dealer Andre Emmerich who was bold enough to say in public a few years ago that he thought the United States \"more than any other [country] has a special claim to the arts of all mankind.\" We live in what are sometimes called enlightened times, but they can hardly be described as enlightened in terms of antiquity, as long as these sorts of attitudes pervade public thinking. Many archaeologists are wondering if there is a future for the past and some fear that Ancient Egypt is faced with total extinction. But let us take heart from the immortal and inspired words of the great Jean Francois Champollion: Egypt is always herself, at all stages in her hitory, always great and powerful in art and enlightenment. Going backthrough the centuries, we see her always shining with the same brilliance, and the only thing we lack to satisfy our curiosity is a knowledge of the origin and growth of civilization itself. As these pages have shown, at least something has been done to satisfy Champollion's, and our, curiosity.","tags":"thoughts","url":"https://fengxia41103.github.io/myblog/history.html"},{"title":"Slow down","text":"Have you had this experience, that something you are familiar with, suddenly slowed down, which made you feel that everything was in a slow motion? I know, it sounds pretty strange, and it is indeed strange. On the way to work this morning I was listening to my all time favourate movie , and for some reason I was playing it in a 1.5x slower speed than normal, and how strange it all sounded! The speech, the music, the vibes, all slowed down just a bit! I could still tell the voices, plots, not like that the voice was changed to some low tone when you play the records really really slowly. No. They were pretty much intact, but you could sense the pace of it felt, different. It was quite an interesting experience. Then, cars going by. I suppose they were driving in their normal speed, even they felt, slowed down — the drivers were not as aggressive as usual , and the whole rythm of life was on a slow track of some sort. It was a matrix glitch. I wouldn't think it will make much of a difference if you just played a track for the first time. It's only the familiarity of thing that has ingrained you with a certain perception which created this disparity effect. So like everything else, it's your own perception that got you think what is normal and what is not. But in reality, there isn't such a thing as being normal, it's all in your mind.

This is really sad. Really. I never met the guy, but honestly, I have zero interest meeting him or even talking to him. Just by looking at his professional profile gives me a fit, a young HR director in the 30s and is workholic ... but really, my experience with Chinese version of workholic is that they work in low efficiency, has no vision of the work they are working on, putting in no thoughts into how to make this work better because they are plainly told what to do so they think they are doing the job just because they are doing what was told. Often they have zero understanding (or worse, wrong understandings) of the objective, and just blindly executing them since the boss is the brain — just so wrong! There is no crowd wisdom, no contribution, no discussion, no collaboration, just command and serfdom . Really. Even as a HR person, if his style is just telling ppl what to do without asking, motivating, inspiring and encouraging, forget it, he is in the wrong business, and whoever puts him in this position has no fxxx clue what HR is about → it's not a management, hello!!!? It's not hiring, training, filling a position where another screw is needed. It's caring and monitoring and putting yourself into others' pain and frustration at work, and trying to understand, to balance, and to make ppl feel comfortable with where they are and what they do. That's hard work because who wants to really understand another human's problem and ambition and problems in life? I don't know. This world is crazy. The BS ppl gets what they want by elbowing other ppl aside, while rewards go to these bullies. It's a Darwin's jungle. Sometimes I wonder whether this is also just my perception, like the slow motion experience I just had this morning? But, as of this moment, I think not. They are just BS ppl, and they disgust me to the core, not because they are bad or anything, but because they dress themselves up as if they are intelligent and powerful and knowing what they are doing, while in my eyes they are imbecile and coward that they took the easy way out by shouting their want but no asking and interest of what they mean to others.

The experience I want to have is a local dev that I can copy & paste from some base image in case I forgot to take a snapshot at milestone. This way I feel comfortable to stand up a sandbox, try out crazy things, then discard it entirely at done, and repeat. So this means something minimal, fast. First thing first, get kvm and a few tools: $ apt kvm libvirt-bin bridge-utils cloud-utils cloud-init libguestfs-tools Cloud image Don't bother with full blown .iso , use cloud images, eg. xenial 16.04 , my de faco at writing. It's < 300M and boots fast.

Looking at the output above, virtual size ( 2.2G ) is the maxium disk space this image can grow to; disk size is just the .img file's size on disk when you do ls -lh . We want to increase base image's virtual size and here is how-to. Resize original image in place . This will add 20G to virtual size . But this is not sufficient, the disk inside this image needs to be expanded also (see step #3 below). So think of this step as a wish to the disk size I want to have, and step 3 is the actual implementation to make it a reality. shell $ qemu-img resize orig.img +20G $ qemu-img info orig.img <-- confirm new \"virtual size\" Make a copy: shell $ cp orig.img orig-copy.qcow2 Resize disk inside the qcow2 image, and save (in this case, we save newly expanded image back to orig.img , but you can save to any file name you want.): shell $ sudo virt-resize --expand /dev/sda1 orig-copy.qcow2 orig.img Backing files Backing files is awesome! The idea is also referred as external snapshots . A few useful references to understand this concept — Advanced snapshots w/ libvirt by Redhat, QEMU snapshot doc , and a blog whose diagram I'm copying below which explained well what these snapshots are related. In a nutshell, external snapshot keeps a pointer to its base image ( backing files ). Any new writes will then be applied to the snapshot image, not the backing file → this feels like git commits and branches, isn't it? An example diagram is shown below in which 3 guests are cloned from a base image, which is then updated, and a 4th guest is then cloned off the updated base image.

Without it, snapshots we made above will boot, but you can't login (tried \"ubuntu, passw0rd\", \"ubuntu, ubuntu\", \"ubuntu, [no password]\", none works). To use cloud-init , we need to create a user-data file which is actually a cloud-config in YAML format. cloud-init can use other formats . Take a look. A minimal version of cloud-config is shown below, which allows ubuntu user login using the password value you defined here, eg. whatever001 . #cloud-config password : whatever001 chpasswd : expire : False ssh_pwauth : True Now how cloud-init works? Essentially you make user-data into a disk or iso that can be mounted to your VM at boot. Your VM's OS image should have had cloud-init installed (and configured?) so when it boots it will search for user-data & meta-data , and run their instructions. cloud-init in raw $ cloud-localds -m local my-seed.img my-user-data [ my-meta-data ] When using cloud-localds , make sure to use -m local so to enable the NoCloud data source (otherwise, booting will stuck with error url_helper.py[WARNING]: Calling 'http://169.254.169.254/2009-04-04/meta-data/instance-id failed... because cloud-init by default will expect a server somewhere serving user-data and meta-data files. NoCloud says they are on a local disk). Example as used in KVM's xml. Make sure slot= index is unique, and <target dev= index is unique. <disk type= 'file' device= 'disk' > <driver name= 'qemu' type= 'raw' /> <source file= '/home/fengxia/workspace/tmp/my-seed.img' /> <backingStore/> <target dev= 'vdb' bus= 'virtio' /> <alias name= 'virtio-disk1' /> <address type= 'pci' 1 domain= '0x0000' bus= '0x00' slot= '0x09' function= '0x0' /> </disk> cloud-init in ISO $ genisoimage --output my-seed.iso -volid cidata -joliet -rock my-user-data [ my-meta-data ] The key here is -volid value must be cidata ! Example KVM xml below. Again, <target dev= index should be unique. <disk type= 'file' device= 'cdrom' > <source file= '/home/fengxia/workspace/tmp/my-seed.iso' /> <target dev= 'vdb' bus= 'ide' /> <readonly/> </disk> Sum it up So back to our mission — to use cloud image as base and external snapshots as our dev sandbox: Download a cloud image Resize image Create a snapshot with backing file Add .snap as a disk in kvm xml Create user-data Create seed.img from user-data Add seed.img as a disk in kvm xml virsh create [your xml] Enjoy. helper files Everything you need is here .To start a kvm from scratch.

How many times have I watched and listened to this film? I'm playing it everyday now at work as it is also the only movie I loaded on this computer. While I was doing it, I was thinking what I would like to hear when I need a little sound, and it was the only one I wanted then. Got curious of its reviews, I know, I haven't read any of others' reviews of it till now. But honestly, like the guy in the film, why do I care what other people say about it, if myself enjoys it already? Who the hell care what they say? So what surprised me, as well as impressed me, was that it was done with 30 million dollars, and the director's first film, Whipsplash , was done in 3. What am I trying to say? is that whenever I was hearing the piano theme of La la land, I felt deeply moved as if the sweet and bitter memory came into life, dancing, starting at me, asking me to rejoin it and to relive it. That, is magical. I can't help thinking that with that much budget, how many technology projects I have witnessed or heard that had flushed down the drain, and the same budget that produced music, literature, choreography, film, that has touched your inner self with a timeless effect? Wouldn't that be a better way to spend and to invest? Growing older, I began to feel more and more of the magic of arts, which in so many ways is contradicting with my profession as a computer guy, which speaks hard, cold, seemingly objective logic of if-else. Going into the Boston Arts Museum, the first time seeing Van Gogh's painting was breathtaking — they were sooo small, soooo colorful, soooo different from anything else in that room — even as an engineer I couldn't help wondering how he did it, or even perceived this, view!? You know, countless times at work I felt down not because how hard the task was, but how thoughtless sometimes I felt towards the problem, yes, it is just scary when you find yourself having no mental picture of a path to even try, the feeling of a dead end. So here are these arts, speak to you with their own life, touches your soul, disturb an ebb that feel so remote, yet so real, so you. Maybe, art is a greater form than hi-tech, and being an artist who can write and produce these timeless pieces, is a greater mind. The piano of the La la land, will sadden you one day too, when the reality collapses all around.","tags":"thoughts","url":"https://fengxia41103.github.io/myblog/art%20is%20better.html"},{"title":"Linux laptop","text":"Instructions to get Ubuntu Xenial & Bionic (or any Linux) as your laptop OS.

The higher the number, the less sensitive it becomes . On X1 4th gen, setting to 60 65 makes it feels solid, 65 70 is hardly responsive. The old values of 25 30 was too sensitive. ```shell xinput set-prop 11 268 60 65 0 ``` Search for synaptics.conf . On X1 4th gen, it's located at /usr/share/X11/xorg.conf.d/50-synaptics.conf . Add two lines to it (alternatively, add the set-prop line from step 4 to your .bashrc works too): ```shell Section \"InputClass\" Identifier \"touchpad catchall\" Driver \"synaptics\" MatchIsTouchpad \"on\" Option \"FingerLow\" \"60\" # <-- Option \"FingerHigh\" \"65\" # <-- ``` Reboot, and verify using xinput list-props [index] that new values are in use. You should be good now. Disable touchpad while typing Another trick is to disable touchpad while typing. This definitely removed the jumpy typing almost completly.

I used to think the can do attitude is so positive, energetic, optimistic, worth holding on, worth broadcasting, worth preaching, worth teaching, worth affecting everyone around me. After all, wasn't that my motto and I tried to teach Noah that, too, that the never give up spirit? But when it is used broadly within a context just about anything you can think of, in job, in life, it feels so, vain, so going into a battle while disregarding the odds in reality. What about cut loss and run? Why never say no!? How do you know the condition permits you to say yes? shouldn't we just quit, sometimes, when our judgement tells us it's not a good idea to go forward? Like yesterday when Noah and I played openra and the rush AI just threw at me an army of artileries while my defense was not up to hold on → so I quit. What type of example and message I have just sent to Noah then? Quitting? Giving up? but don't we sometimes just need a reset? Yes, I think we all do. Further, wouldn't it be better to question everything instead of just accepting the status quo and nod? Why should I commit myself into a never say no land while no one, including me, has an idea, has control, of the future? Even if I agree with the slogan, isn't it just an empty promise? Interestingly this morning NPR was talking about the NFL kneeling down situation, and one girl was saying \"they never fully explained what this is about? how long is it going to be? how far is it going to be? what are we trying to achieve? why am I doing this? .... \" exactly. Aren't we supposed to do our own critical thinking just like that so to make our own judgement on these issues, any issues? I think the can do attitude is still good, but not with a slogan-ish propaganda blanketing everything underneath. Yes you need to hold on to difficult times, if you decide it is worthwhile, for whatever justification you have for yourself. No one should tell you to do that; yourself is the only agent you can rely on, should rely on, and can rely on. Use your own judgement, don't just say yes. Question the heart out of its origin, intention, argument and assumption. I really like the her line \"why am I doing this?\" You can still do it, or not, just that it is a conscious decision instead of someone made the decision for you, because otherwise, you actually gave yourself up while you thought you were living towards to the never give-up life, and how ironic that will be .

The word always reminds me the dawn of WWII that Japan empire was, in my history education, powered by its fanatic nationalism spirits to conquer the world and to bring prosperity to its new lands . What made me think of this word, however, is something that parallels this feeling, and I don't know yet how to put it — China's 大国崛起, its ambition to reestablish its past glory (presumably existed in history, which I actually have a quite different opinion), which in many cases involves two themes — to get a campus of followers (surrounding neighbours), and to live a life of the good, old times. But, this is really troublesome, to me. First of all, the glory of leadership is a terrible thought. This is consistent of the hierarchical structure you see everywhere China that somehow someone must be the boss while everyone else around him/her will be obedient. Not only this is a social dynamics leading to rigid command chain thus staleness, but if you ever look at the countries around us and ask yourself how many devoted admirers there are, the practical answer is, none . That's right, none. There is no single country around the China's virtual sphere that will kowtow, because they look at this giant next door not as a powerful neighbour with a smile and friendship, but a powerful neighbour with an unpredictable temper. I don't recall where I picked up this line, but the best analysis of the image of China was summarized as \"Having a big China is like you are sitting on a subway, and here comes sits down a big guy next to you with tattoos and no shirt on\"... So if we think about in our life how you will like someone like that, you start to realize that an affection (between two people) is more about similar taste, view of the world, education, flavor of coffee, favourate movie, sports, and so on, rather than a party's sheer power. If the formers grow apart, one's power can only become a threat instead of a selling point. Second, the thought of living the past glory, and to live the good old time. I constantly find myself wanting to go to the past (of my life) because I miss the girls I loved and wished a different outcome with them if I could turn back the clock. So I'm guilty as charged. The talk about how rich 宋朝 dynasty was, and how wonderful they were treating people, how well doing people were (according to novels like 金瓶梅) all sound romantic. There might even be a trace of unsatisfaction of the present because, otherwise, why would you go back? But if one takes a step back, I think this is really a human tendency to romanticize the past . Past wasn't that good; it's just the brain (and history) filtered the unpleasants and left you with all the happiness and fun. Take 宋朝 for example, the life quality you are enjoying today is far superior to the emperor back then — he had no TV, no car, no fitness center, no flu shot, no ice cream , no plane to travel, no ipad, no swimming pool, no Nike shoe, no bike, no talk show, no library, no book store, no coffee shop, no Mozart... what he had was just power, human labor, and an illusion of glory because he truly believed his empire was the center of the universe! But really, if anyone can hold that type of thoughts (and I actually have met quite many who do!), they don't need to go back to the past, they are living the past! — they all think they are powerful, and they are the best... give me a break! If that's the type of price to pay to be glorified again, I don't want it. It's far better to be humbled because you realize how big the world is, how diversified people are, how split views of a seemingly common sense can be, how little you know, and how much you haven't got chance to learn... everytime I walk into a book store or a museum, I felt so insignificant because here I was, standing in front of presence of master minds of human specie who had done something tremendously outstanding, even vulgar arts count — they are reality of someone's mind and effort, so I admire that achievement of 0→1. So why would one want to live in a cave just be called a king and feel good about himself? I think it's all about power, the pipe dream of power, the thought that the country is now powerful, and I want to be that part of power, somehow. This, is what I call Chinese nationalism in the 21st century . How sad, how ridiculous, how dangerous a thought! No, seriously, you don't want to live in 宋朝 for its so called glory. Just think about it, why would you live a life in which salt is a government monopolized, precious stuff ?... if you are really addicted to power, the last thing you want is to have someone's finger on your salt supply valve and grin.","tags":"thoughts","url":"https://fengxia41103.github.io/myblog/china%20nationalism.html"},{"title":"Juju local LXD","text":"Using Juju's LXD provider is the least-hassle way to start an experience of Juju and its charms. However, if you have done charm development for a while, you know making a one line of code change, deploying charm, then wait to see the new code got executed ← it's good 5-10 minutes per cycle. These add up quickly when you are in the middle of churning out code to get your ideas written. Not to mention creating a new machine is 2x slower, and bootstraping a new controller is even worse. I had experience in Shanghai sitting 30+ minutes for a new controller due to the location's unreliable connections, and sometimes it just failed w/ a timeout. What to do? The goal is to create a way to reduce this trial-error cycle as much as possible so to speed up code development. Challenge If you watch juju debug-log while it deploys a charm, you start to realize that there are roughly seven steps: creating a container (will discuss --to switch later) update/upgrade the new container provisioning container with Juju agent installing charm software. This itself includes: transfering charm files to container installing /wheelhouse packages run charm's hooks/install to kick of charm code The last step is what we care about, the rest are there to construct a runtime environment for charm code. So, can we eliminate them or reduce them? Also, the most time consuming pieces are when Juju/agent is hitting a remote repo for system update or package installation. Therefore, limiting these is greatly desired. Remedy Strategy we are to present here is to use a custom-built image so that it has all required package pre-installed. This does not eliminate repo-hit completly, but it reduces the necessity of downloading 100+M of packages, each time! Package installer ( apt , yum , pip ) will simply reply package xyz is already installed — much faster. create a gold image First, we create a gold copy that has everything pre-installed, pre-configured as much as you'd like to: Follow instruction to launch a standard image: ```shell $ lxc launch ubuntu:14.04 gold ``` SSH to your new container, install system packages: ``` shell $ lxc exec gold bash $ apt update $ apt install build - essential libssl - dev libffi - dev python - pip python - dev ``` Update user ubuntu 's password: ```shell $ passwd ubuntu ``` Enable SSH password authentication: ```shell $ nano /etc/ssh/sshd_config # Change to no to disable tunnelled clear text passwords PasswordAuthentication yes # <-- change to \"yes\" ``` Upgrade pip . This is necessary to install /wheelhouse contents properly. ```shell $ pip install pip --upgrade ``` In your charm's dist, there will be a /wheelhouse folder, which hosts a list of .gz files and such. They are python packages needed by charm. Since they are packages into each charm, it makes file transfer to container slower, and installing them is rather redundant if a container is hosting multiple charms. Using scp and ubuntu credential (see step #3) to copy /wheelhouse to container.

Juju uses gold image The only requirement is to have Juju version 2.1+. (optional) Delete standard LXD image: ```shell $ lxc image delete ubuntu-trusty ``` Update juju to 2.1+: ```shell $ sudo snap install juju --classic ``` After upgrading juju, re-bootstrap a controller ( juju bootstrap localhost [pick a name] ). juju deploy mycharm : will create a new machine using a local image w/ alias juju/trusty/amd64 for new machine. This can be verified by watch -n 1 lxc image list to monitor whether it will still download a stock image. add machine manually If there is other orchestration mechanism outside Juju, we can also have it create machines manually : Create a new LXD container using the image (or snapshot): ```shell $ lxc launch juju/trusty/amd64 testme && lxc start testme $ lxc copy gold/snap3 testme && lxc start me ``` Add machine to Juju: ```shell $ juju add-machine ssh:ubuntu@[container's ip] ``` juju deploy mycharm --to [machine #] . Without the --to , Juju will create a new machine by default. Be aware. No more update To speed up the machine even further, we need to disable system update (on by default) so newly created machine (by Juju) will not hit repo for system updates. $ juju model-config enable-os-refresh-update = false $ juju model-config enable-os-upgrade = false Comparison results","tags":"openstack","url":"https://fengxia41103.github.io/myblog/juju%20local%20LXD.html"},{"title":"sharing economy","text":"Sharing economy is hot. Looking around, one can't help feeling just about everything can be shared. But then, you can't help asking yourself, \"where does it end?\" Really, so cars can be shared, houses can be shared, stools can be shared, bikes can be shared... so what can not be? Practically nothing. I think the generalization roots in the word share as itself really doesn't rule out all the confusions out there — are bike sharing really \"sharing\"? or are they just a leasing in disguise? what makes you think one way or the other? what is sharing? I told Noah to share his toys, but to think of it, he didn't necessarily own the toys (for example, when he was in preschool), so the sharing was really an intention, a spiritual openness with benefiting others in mind. Since he is a kid, sharing toys is encouraged; but what if he is an adult and I'm encouraging him to share something that doesn't even belong to him at the first place? What's the message then? What does it even mean? It feels, bad, doesn't it? After all, I certainly don't want any two Pol just come along and decide to share my thing that neither of them owns. I'll be like, what the heck? my definitions So I tried to think of a narrower and clearer definition for sharing : you own the resource that you are sharing benefits created are not determined by increase of resource amount, but by better utilization (interchangeably, efficiency) of existing resource. I like the 2nd point. It's easier to use a bit math here: over all value = unit value * qty . So to increase the over all value , you either increase unit value , thus a unit's efficiency , or qty . I think sharing is all about the unit value (utilize an idle resource). What we are seeing of the explosive increase of qty is just a side effect when more ppl want to participate, but qty is not sharing. The owner prospective, however, bothers me. On one hand it feels just right that you can/should only share what you own — your vacant room, your bike, your tools... but on the other hand, can't you just share anything? I mean, there just isn't anything you own you can not give it a sharing spin — stuff, time, service, what about prostitutes? If it is the oldest profession, isn't it also the oldest sharing economy!? If so, why we are condemning them but praising these so called innovations? We should not. I think sharing implies a sense of motivated willingness and pride, that first of all I like this thing — I'm taking proud of my lovely house, thus wanting to have you experience that (after all, who wants to just share crappy side of his/her stuff). I would almost argue that you should like it to the point you don't want to share, thus making sharing such an emotional experience, that the challenge to overcome unwillingness and to convince youself doing it is the true ingredient that makes sharing valuable and noble . Without this emotional pride that you invest in it, this whole process, being called sharing or not, is nothing but another a emotionless, number-matching business transaction. So here it is, a number 3: ... ... you like what you are sharing Putting this lens on, you will now see how bullshit all these China-invented sharing hoax really are. wiki and quotes I got curious and read about sharing economy , boy, wasn't I impressed! What a wonderful summary of everything I am feeling about this topic but failed to express them well! There are a few slips I think they hit nails on the head, which I'll be quoting here: misnomer The Harvard Business Review argues that \"sharing economy\" is a misnomer, and that the correct word for this activity is \"access economy\". The authors say, \"When \"sharing\" is market-mediated—when a company is an intermediary between consumers who don't know each other—it is no longer sharing at all. Rather, consumers are paying to access someone else's goods or services.\"[14] The article goes on to show that companies (such as Uber) who understand this, and whose marketing highlights the financial benefits to participants, are successful, while companies (such as Lyft) whose marketing highlights the social benefits of the service are less successful. not a gift economy Salon writes that \"the sharing economy ... [is] not the Internet 'gift economy' as originally conceived, a utopia in which we all benefit from our voluntary contributions. It's something quite different—the relentless co-optation of the gift economy by market capitalism. The sharing economy, as practiced by Silicon Valley, is a betrayal of the gift economy. The potlatch has been paved over, and replaced with a digital shopping mall.\" driven by job loss New York Magazine wrote that the sharing economy has succeeded in large part because the real economy has been struggling. Specifically, in the magazine's view, the sharing economy succeeds because of a depressed labor market, in which \"lots of people are trying to fill holes in their income by monetizing their stuff and their labor in creative ways\", and that in many cases, people join the sharing economy because they've recently lost a full-time job, including a few cases where the pricing structure of the sharing economy may have made their old jobs less profitable (e.g. full-time taxi drivers who may have switched to Lyft or Uber). The magazine writes that \"In almost every case, what compels people to open up their homes and cars to complete strangers is money, not trust. ... Tools that help people trust in the kindness of strangers might be pushing hesitant sharing-economy participants over the threshold to adoption. But what's getting them to the threshold in the first place is a damaged economy, and harmful public policy that has forced millions of people to look to odd jobs for sustenance.\" low labor cost Andrew Leonard,[106][107][108] Evgeny Morozov,[109] Bernard Marszalek,[110] Dean Baker,[111][112] and Andrew Keen[113] criticized the for-profit sector of the sharing economy, writing that sharing economy businesses \"extract\" profits from their given sector by \"successfully [making] an end run around the existing costs of doing business\" - taxes, regulations, and insurance. Similarly, In the context of online freelancing marketplaces, there have been worries that the sharing economy could result in a 'race to the bottom' in terms or wages and benefits: as millions of new workers from low-income countries come online. no magic in trust the sharing economy \"doesn't build trust\" because where it builds new connections, it often \"replicates old patterns of privileged access for some, and denial for others\".[116] William Alden wrote that \"The so-called sharing economy is supposed to offer a new kind of capitalism, one where regular folks, enabled by efficient online platforms, can turn their fallow assets into cash machines ... But the reality is that these markets also tend to attract a class of well-heeled professional operators, who outperform the amateurs—just like the rest of the economy\".

Yes, I find human behavior very puzzling. Maybe it's just me that is not connected with surroundings and felt isolated. But seriously, there are just these things that ppl do that I can't help thinking the word irrational is too polite to describe. These days, nothing annoys me more than the morning rush and aggressive drivers. So I was driving to work seven o'clock in the morning in my little Prius C which can only go that fast on the road anyway, and boy, cars were just tailgating, then got impatience, swing to the next lane, bypassing me as if running from a disease, there might even be some dirty look involved and a few curses like asian guy just doesn't know how to drive that type of thing. But seriously!? First of all, there are like a million cars right in front of me, and they are all driving more or less in the same speed, so bypassing me at your top speed only means one thing → step on your brake so you don't hit the car right in front of me → seriously, don't you know distance / speed = time ? Just out of curiosity, who leaves house seven o'clock in the morning instead of staying in their cozy houses? Chances are we are all going to work. Well, so ask yourself, how many ppl you know who at least claim that they * love their jobs? Few I suppose. So here are these enthusiastic drivers who are eager to get to work! I mean, I can understand there are some ppl who might have emergency to take care, some who are just love their jobs, but seriously, the disproportional number of cars going fast on the road just amazes me. I wonder what type of paradise they work at? On the similar note, if you do have something so important that you have to rush like this, well, quoting my beloved Professor Michel : there is always an earlier train . So get up earlier! The highway is open 24x7 , you know that, right? And here is something even more fantastic. Ppl literally step on their gas to pass me while I was cruising towards a RED light!? wow, this is just beyond my comprehension completly, ultimately, thoroughly. uh, are you going to drive through it? I would love to see it. I thought you are in a hurry, why stop?... I don't know. They are either blind, or just stupid. If passing me gives them pleasure, I guess that's one positive way to look at this. Then, there is the control. There have been quite a few times the annoying driver turned out be someone working in the same company cause we all pulled in the same parking lot. Here stepping out some harmless looking man or woman, I just wonder why they were so impatient while now they are just taking the slow stroll as everyone else to the office, no hurry, no rush, no enthusiasm anymore. Why? Were they really pushy, or it was just my perception that was faulty? I tend to blame the rear view mirror for this — didn't it have a label saying \" object seems closer than it actually is \"? But then, why making them look closer, if being closer makes personal uncomfortable? Yeah, it's all rear view mirror's fault. Peace. Pickups. Pickups are the worst. They bully, just because they can. Once a while I got the same move over slow ass type of gesture from small engine cars, too! and that just felt strange. Shouldn't we small engines support each other? Apparently not so. This, I think, also signifies what we see in society, that ppl in weak positions don't bundle together. Instead, they actually tread each other to get ahead, even the gain is small. Interesting. But don't they sometimes all uniformly doing the same wrongs also as if they are so tightly integrated that nothing different can be tolerated and even imagined!? So what sway them one way or another? I don't know. Human is a mysterious being to me. Or, maybe my sense just got it all wrong. How sad.","tags":"thoughts","url":"https://fengxia41103.github.io/myblog/people%20psyche.html"},{"title":"Modern slavery","text":"I'm convinced now that the number one problem I am annoyed by the modern Chinese culture is that it create self-contradictory person. They speak in logics however they see fit without being aware of that two points coming out of their mouth are actually contradictory. Take it further, they took a one-sided view of history in such a self-confidence that they completly fail to realize that what they are bragging and broadcasting are exactly the same thing in history they vow to be a terrible deed by any measure. Trade A case in point is the popular place such as the 奶奶庙 . I think the debate of it in the context of pop art or even pioneer art is completly a walk-around. Can people idol these objects? of course. Can they bring peace and love? Doesn't matter, and to some, yes, so be it. Are they arts? Yes. Are they art I like? No. Should I respect its right to be there? Yes, as long as I don't go there, and it doesn't come close me. So what is my point!? If you ask any Chinese about the dark age in Europe, 黑暗的中世纪, the years when China was supposed to be glorious and prosperous and everywhere else is just, dark, they will all agree on one well-known example that church was selling coupon to save people's soul, for a monetary price. It's an example how ridiculous the western religion had become, and how shameless and greedy these religious man had become. Shame on them! But you know what!? Visitors of the 奶奶庙 are exactly doing that — trade! I pay you some due, and you give me luck in turn. This is exactly what the dark age priests were doing, so we were told, and we are all disgusted by it. But we are doing it, everywhere!!!! And let's be clear of one thing — this is not religion. Religion has fear; here has none. It is an outcry to put this in the setting of a religion, while you trade for personal benefits and leave out guilt all at the same place, at the same time. This is exactly how Chinese are operating today — dressing up as if it is a noble deed in which you believe, you respect and you fear, but the truth is they just want both sides of a coin, a mission impossible, as the deal. Slave If we take this even further, it's quite entertaining. If that traffic Godness casts you a good luck, who is to make up the accident statistics? If EVERYONE is now praying for the same Godness, does it just eliminate accidents entirely!? What if two pray to two different Gods, since we are geographically apart and my local people just made up a new God who has the same purpose? Woudln't then become a race between the two Gods, that the stronger one will fulfill its protection, while the other one fails? So we are back to the old time when Gods are fighting, for us human, and we can only watch and bear their outcome? If so, aren't we just paying them to do our fight? Apparently so! This is a crowd sourcing boxing ring in which these made up Gods are going to compete for their made up powers! How can then this be not comical!!! Even more. These Gods are in a really sad position. Even if they had the power as they say, they have no option to back out a deal. I can pay the due when I feel so, and as soon as I pay it, the contract is formed. The poor statue can't say no! So I could be a terrible bad driver, and this traffic Godness is made to protect me (if she wins the God-fighting ring) without an option. I think we will all agree that this is a terrible position to be in. Literally the Godness loses control of her own work — this is like you work as a slave, you do what is told — so who is the master now!? haha.. this is really interesting! Anyway. I just wanted to point out, how ridiculous the logic is that this thing implies. It validates the feeling that when you look at it or hearing about it, you feel that something is not right, and you know that even the prayers are not really believing this — it's a play in which they play a role. Prayers get a psyche boost, the Godness gets nothing, and the operators get money. And who are these operators? They are the slave owners in our era.","tags":"thoughts","url":"https://fengxia41103.github.io/myblog/modern%20slavery.html"},{"title":"Art, a thought","text":"Finished reading Kenneth Clark's Civilisation . I can't say I actually understand the book, because nearly every item he was talking about and describing with passion and logic, I had little idea. I barely recognized some names, and very little of the artifacts. Sculptures, some; paintings, nearly none; background history and social context, zero. Even the wordings he used were elusive to me, because it felt discrete in a sense of continuity of meaning — I could recognize most of the words, then never saw the pattern that this word is connected with that word in a sentence, and had no idea what this combination means! Art? Alas! This is terrible. Here I am, reading a classic on civilisation , yet I do not understand a thing! On the back of my mind I was thinking, isn't this the same feeling of ignorance and disconnect when foreigner looks at Chinese arts? and what about the most recent news of 奶奶庙 , that people are debating whether these local artifacts are a form of popular art, or an example of poor taste. So when it is an eye sore, to me, isn't it because I lack of the context, thus, like looking at these truly marvelous of the West, so as to being clueless of how to appreciate? Isn't beauty , after all, a complete subjective matter? But if so, how do we perceive beauty? how do we create a beautiful thing, a beautiful feeling, a beautiful act, anymore, if it is just your words against mine? Doesn't this feel, wrong? Interesting. I do not know. I don't think there is a qualified beauty , that someone can define, or determine, or discriminate one form or another. Yet, there is a sense of beauty in us. You can't deny it. There is a common beauty. There is a timelessness in them. I can't explain, nor even give example. But it's there. The La Marseillaise moves me everytime it is played. It's a sensation shooting through my vein. You want to stand up, you want to march, you want to fight for a principle, and you can die for it. Music, painting, sculpture, literature... arts have such a power that they can possess the receiver at the moment of engagement. How transforming! So what about these 奶奶庙 arts? Aren't they on the equal footing as those classics since they also bring a sensation to their audience, just on a different spectrum than mine? No But no. I still have to disagree. As liberal as I try, these objects are vulgar. Same apply to many of the modern Chinese sculptures, statues, and buildings. To think of it, it is not these big mass themselves are at fault. No. There are some that are just replica of the originals, like the Charging Bull , while others are free range vulgarity some called creativity . Even when it is a truthful copy, it looks bad. The creative ones are, just alien. Why so? I think they lost the soul, the genuity , the spirit within, the life, and thus become a superficial, lifeless, thus become a joke. The great sculptures convey such a force, be it a smooth marble of a human head, or a charging bull in bronze, it talks to you without holding back an inch of the feelings that author felt and invested into it. No holding back. It's not only all there, it wants more, it creates more, it empowers you. Beethoven, Mozart, La bohème , love letter, a great movie, a portrait... it beholds you, it has its own identity, speaking to you, staring at you, and disrupting you. It's a language by its own that best describes the scene and conveys an emotion, and it does it perfectly . It has motion, has a thought, has a moment, that draws you into it, so you can be part of what it is presenting. Those Chinese mockups, lost all of the above. You know what, this actually is familiar — they took the shell, thinking the shell is the whole. So there is a perfect replica in form, but has no root — a charging bull by the entrance of a condo community, a Capitol Hill shaped county government building, or even the super ugly egg . I think they are all looking great, marvelous creation; but they don't fit where they are because they have no soul. What to fight and charge when it sits next to a bunch of cookie cutter high-rise condos!!!????? And how it be restless and resisting when the whole point of residential is about peaceful family life!??? Isn't this a joke or what!? And the performance arts in a round, smooth, harmony looking egg!? NO! Performance arts are energy, initiation, burst of force, searching deep in human soul, touching the untouchable, speaking the unspeakables! How can they live with harmony!!?... I'm angry, I'm about to cry, because they are sooooo fake and soo lost the meaning of what the form is for... these, are genuine insult on arts. Diversity creates beauty (how interesting the fearless girl is!). But fake shells can never.","tags":"thoughts","url":"https://fengxia41103.github.io/myblog/art%20a%20thought.html"},{"title":"Tencent & Opium","text":"Listening to this talk this morning, the thought hit me. How do you look at this game ? Games, in my humble opinion, are just, bad. I know it's unfair to say so since I have grown out of that addiction phase, and every boy/man will go through that sometime in their life, inevitably. I don't know the psyche or chemistry or bio-trigger behind this phenomenon. There must be reason, especially a chemical reason. Brain likes it not because it feels good, because there is a chemical stuff that equals feeling good — just the same stuff in different outfit, gamble = sex that kind of high. But what bothers me is this. When the entire Chinese population is so trenched in their moral high ground through education (which myself is a victim, too) that the recent history of humiliation started with the Opium War caused by nothing but foreign bully and their blood-thirsty greed, don't they see the parallel of what they are doing right now, with this game!? When investors are getting a high from Tencent's big hit, how is it different from the East Indian Company was rewarded for their success in selling this great stuff called Opium to the unexplored super market — the Orient/the great middle kingdom of China? It's the same in my opinion. Because for market and investment, there is nothing about moral, nothing about right and wrong (and who gets to define these anyway? do you really even know what a right is? Is there even such a thing as being right ?) It is all about returns, which is objective, clear cut, and zero-emotion. As long as the market responds positively and cash flows in, investors are happy. These same set of investors can, at the same time, be mad at some other corporations who are doing the evil by ruining some other people's lives. If the suffering is remote enough, and I do mean remote being in both the geographical sense and logic sense, it become just another news slip crossing the screen. This is curious then. In human core, we do not operate on facts, at all. We operate on a set of images we believe → beliefs. These beliefs are self-fulfilling. They can be completly contradictory, yet causing no hesitation in one's thought or behavior. We don't even realize them in most times. We can equally defend them one way or the other. They are just equally true. So how do you explain feelings like shame , disappointment , regret , anger ? Aren't they then just a creation of yourself, because they came from perceived misalignment between your belief versus facts? If so, doesn't it mean that you then don't have a justification to whine, to feel bad, to become angry or annoyed, or to feel that way at all? Extending this out, doesn't it mean all critics become pointless, because they are based on a view, and that is just subjective and arbitrary? How do you look at history then, such as the Opium War ? It is a national scar. But since their motivation and execution back then were just as natural and logical as what we are seeing right now with Tencent, how can one continue to blame the war and those barbarians ? How about public opinion then? How about a popular belief that everyone adopts, at least for now? If all these go out of the window, how do we act? Shouldn't I still feel anything? If they are all just my own wishful thinking, why can't I change a view and viola, all the bad stuff are just disappear? In other words, why can't I fool myself all of the time? If I could, then isn't it really becoming a Matrix world, in which no one is living; they are merely experiencing a virtual blank. How scary is that! I don't know. This one seems to raise more questions than it answers. I was meant to criticize the Tencent fans for their paradox. But then, what am I to judge ? The paradox is valid; but I could not explain, nor have a solution. I feel it is so universally true that it's even false to point it out as I am doing (I think I'm doing). What a bizarre and convoluted reasoning?","tags":"thoughts","url":"https://fengxia41103.github.io/myblog/tencent%20and%20opium.html"},{"title":"What does IT system bring","text":"After long thoughts, I believe I have come to the conclusion that there are only three things that technology should bring, would bring, and should their objectives: information repository : everything is saved, time stamped, digitized, and probably even structured. efficiency : this comes from the fact that data inputs are sanitized with definitions, rules, and assumptions — the manual way of doing things bury all the domain knowledge within the head of individual employee. Instead, implementation of a system extract those into a more explicit form (code written, even though still arcane, is better than hidden in someone's brain/instinct), and this create efficiency, because communication cost is lowered — within a system, each party uses the same set of vocabulary, and gradually adopting others' definitions. Conflicts are solve upfront in system design phase and being continuously negotiated so the system can function coherently . Therefore, the system forms a framework to anchor discussion and debates. accountability : this is really a workflow decision. I know clients who are horrified to have the transparency of data, because then decision maker is now liable to review and penalty. Granted, workflow is as good as the level of commitment of operators. Garbage in, garbage out. And overuling with offline information and arbitration makes the system obsolete instantly, because it loses the status of the system of record . If they don't fit your bill, or your customer's, technology will not help, will not solve your problem, and you should just walk away.","tags":"thoughts","url":"https://fengxia41103.github.io/myblog/what%20does%20it%20bring.html"},{"title":"Lost jobs, not really","text":"These days, everywhere you turn, there is talk about AI, and one primary theme is the human fear of being replaced by robots, thus resulting in huge waves of layoffs and job loss, which then leads to social turmoils, revolutions, and government collapses. Horrible. But if you think of it, it isn't new. Not only it isn't new, I think it is one of those topics that is perpetual true and perpetually horrible , whenever you bring it up. Like a nightmare, the only way to deal with it, is to wake up (in other words, not to think of it). As long as you put yourself into that scene, man, it's certainly gonna be bad. Exaggerated? Just take a step back and name all the parallels you can think of — when there is a more efficient way in production → job loss when there is a new way in production → job loss when an innovation emerges that takes the fantasy of everybody → job loss I think you get the idea. The theme is the same, that the old way of doing things are bound to be changed, and with that change, many positions will be eliminated, and people lose their old jobs because they are not needed anymore . So in the core, the fear is about not feeling needed anymore, an abandonment if you will, by the society. Isn't this the same as being abandoned by love? I have always been thinking that if only one knows where the next relationship is, the agony of breaking up wouldn't be that hard at all. Borrowing from the Hunger Game, the only thing that is more powerful than fear, is hope . I recall the book of The Affluent Society , which argues that with the prosperity of America, many will be rendered idle because high production efficiency simply doesn't need that many labor. The author said this new class, the ideal class , is not only natural, but actually good, so might as well embrace it instead of fighting it. Doesn't it sound the same arguments we are hearing about AI? Yes, I think so. That's why I say this topic isn't new, and is going to be repeated over and over and over. Different trigger, same talk. Your job, isn't ready Then I was thinking, what type of jobs will be eliminated? The immediate reaction will be — low skill jobs. They can be easily replaced by machine power, can't they? But, what if, your job, isn't ready!? Robots/computers aren't monsters who just eat everything on its way and still digest well. They pick; they have an appetite of certain things, but not all. So the question becomes, what do they like? They like logic, reasoning, and deterministic result; their stomach doesn't do well if you feed them ambiguity . What are these about? Not sheer machine power, your arms vs. his hydraulics. It's about decision making (in today's glorified term, it's about intelligence ). In any computerized application, there is an inherent decision making process, which is derived from offline domain knowledge. Computer is really brainless, actually. Unless you tell it there is a decision to be made, and these are the if-else you need to make your decisions based on, it has no idea. So who knows there is a decision point, and here are the 4-5 options, and condition to pick one over another? — someone who possessed this domain knowledge, be it from experience, from business requirement, from management needs, from a genius stroke — they are all offline and domain specific . Computer can model, implement, and enforce them; but it can't invent them . So what type of jobs are ready to be, computerized ? Corporate jobs, because they are usually better defined (what to do), better structured (how to do it), better documented (models), better understood (explicit domain knowledge), and often repetitive (wow, this is paradise for computers). To replace a guy shoveling a sidewalk, his labor can be easily done by a robot, but his pattern of shoveling and his experience of digging here versus there because of the difference of soil or his tool, if there is any, well, nobody has ever spend time to extract that domain knowledge , therefore computer is clueless about him, therefore, his job is just not READY! The fundamental law here is the cliche that there is no free lunch . Extracting that domain knowledge and modeling it into a computer bears a cost (cost of someone else to understand you, and you willing to open up your secrets ), and that cost does not justify someone to study and figure out how a robot can do that shoveling job. Human labor, as long as it is cheaper than this cost, is plainly safe, for economic reason. So, as long as your job sucks to a degree that it is boring, making only reasonable profits, and disgusts many people, your job is safe. Of course, here lies the other extreme of the spectrum, that the job is challenging to the point that human simply doesn't know how to model it or even understand it, say, write me an awesome novel , play the piano like Mozart did — unless you can define awesomeness and can model Mozart style, you are out of luck.","tags":"thoughts","url":"https://fengxia41103.github.io/myblog/lost%20jobs.html"},{"title":"Self-reflection","text":"Watching the Civilisaiton Youtube, what a fantastic topic and description of western civilisation! This is quite interesting especially with the backdrop of Jared Diamond's Guns, Germs, and Steel , which I found it godly convincing as I was first introduced to think about the history of human civilisation through his documentary . However, the two views of what gave birth and energy to the rise and fall of a civilisation are quite, different, though both are intriguing and far beyond my scope of knowledge and even imagination. Nonetheless, there is one thing suddenly came to me, and I think it's a topic worth writing about. What is it? In all the videos, literature, thinking, and theory of the indisputable advance of the western civilisation, there are plenty episodes and text devoted to the dark side of the western history — slavery, the conquest of South America, war with the native Indians... there were pure cruelty, absolutely inhumane deeds, against animal, against nature, against another human being. It makes your heart shaken; if there were God, he must have been on vacation then. So even though the conclusion and the way to state those years are one-sided (as I have not seen a black host in the program), the sheer act to illustrate what happened, to ask why that was so, to question what impact it made to the advance of society and the deterrence of progress, to feel shamed about the horror winners imposed upon the losers, to caution that history isn't just a mirror of ourselves, it is a prophecy, is encouraging. On the contrast, I asked myself, what literature or anything I have been taught in school or heard in today's forum touches upon the same theme of China's own history !? I could think of none. Yes, there are programs on history, and I have quite enjoyed some of them. But even in those which I really liked, I hardly sensed an eye of scrutiny that not only picked up all the romance and wonder, but also the human cost lay behind those pride. Yes, I know there is censorship that made authors and hosts no choice but to turn their head to one side, only. But that doesn't explain it. Really, among nearly all talks and shows, I haven't heard a single voice who digs into the vast, pride history of boasted 5,000 years of this enormous oriental civilisation, and ask, \"How did other races living in China these days lose the race to the dominant汉?\" You know, these days one thing that constantly makes me mad is the popular opinion that all population except those of the middle earth were backwards, and were only saved by China's advanced philosophy, culture, and technology. They paid contribute out of a pure admiration and respect; no bully, no trickery, no fuss. How could that be!!!? No way. If we truly believe the length of our history, then think about it, 5000 years! That's an unimaginable length of time that no one has ever experienced (cause we all die < 100, most of us). Stop cheery picking a few moments in the history and say \"Look! See how wonderful we have treated them!\" Excuse me? The country could only have gained this mass of land through force. Period. Even for the US, it bought land from France and Mexico because, well, they showed enough force to take them whether the seller was willing to sell or not. So if you still believe in a tale of angel stroke a deal for the two parties in which one party traded an abstract called culture (or arts, poems, philosophy, anything that is paperware) while the other trades land, then you live in the world of the Matrix. Neil, wake up. So this lack of self-reflection, the constant finger pointing to invaders who caused ALL the misery for any setbacks, is perfectly consistent with what I witnessed in today's China — irresponsible from top government all the way to the street vendor. Of course, how could one do anything bad, if his ancestor has been kind to everyone come to his path for 5000 years!? We always showered them with kindness and wisdom, but look at what they brought in return? This, is just utterly absurd! To learn, we know review is a must; to do better next time, no professor can beat your own mistakes and errors. Apply to a person, apply to a country, apply to a society, apply to a civilisation. So next time when someone brags about the rise the new China, let's not use GDP or the 13 billion people for index. How about the number of documentaries and books, like this one , for a change (of mindset)?","tags":"thoughts","url":"https://fengxia41103.github.io/myblog/self-reflection.html"},{"title":"Marketing","text":"Man wasn't that annoying! Listened to this book on the way to outlet yesterday, and the language it used annoyed the shxxt out of me. Let me explain why. Total attention The content is actually fine. There is a total sum of attention consumers can provide: total consumer attention = num_of_consumer x 16 hr/day x 365 days/yr x adjustment % So in essence this term is equivalent to a percentage of total time a consumer spends on a particular message, which corresponds to what I have always been saying that the only dimension immune to any manipulation and variables (by far) is time — it is a continuously flow forward. No one can stop it; no one can shorten it or expand it; and nothing can ignore it. So far, so good. Then the talk starts a deep dive into what he thinks the successful stories of marketing by quoting history of certain marketing and strategies, and that's when it started to annoy me, badly. Grand labeling First, the term 祖师爷 . What does it mean? This is such a common term used by the Chinese as if everybody has agreed upon its definition. Here is one : 某种技艺的发明创造者。 对一行业的形成，有过重大贡献的人。 某位历史名人，曾做过某种行业。 某为神灵与某一行业有关。 But you see, when you want to make a statement that a marketing strategy is not new , you can use a supportive evidence by tracing back in time to find an older instance of it. But then labeling that instance to 祖师爷 (and the talk is filled with this term, 祖师爷this, 祖师爷 that..), no! Where is the proof that he invented the strategy? or to prove that his practice of the trade contributed significantly to the development of this line of business? Since words like significantly must be relative , the argument has to be provide a reference, sth like Before his time, the work was done in such a such way, and it was less effective... comparing to his new method.... Something like that. Otherwise, that's just a single instance you mentioned and then quickly labeled with a good looking word 祖师爷 as if this is self-justified! But you see, that's exactly the problem of today's Chinese expression — because it lacks the depth of research, or lacks the willingness to convey knowledge, it falls back to use these terms liberally as a window dresser so to make it impressive, but actually vague at best, and completly false at worst! This is cheating. This can easily becomes a lie. A grand label doesn't make your message any more true than it is. Period. But sadly, it can fool some of the people some of the time. Propaganda Now comes the worst part. First, let me make this clear, whoever thinks of marketing as being dressed up every moment (night and day) and party party, you shouldn't do this business, at all. Marketing/advertising is neither flashy nor noble. It itself is not 高大上 , because it's a line of business that, like everyone else, takes a lot of research, hard work, and discipline to be successful. I think the underline image of a marketer being always the one standing the spot light making some grand announcement to his audience (yes, and the talk inevitably used Hitler as an example of such image) is just wrong by itself! No, I'm not against using Hitler in this context — he certainly had his way to launch propaganda and influence his audience. But his being the tag of this horrifying episode of human history was not rooted in his charm or his voice or his marketing strategy. No. The event has a deeply rooted historical context traced way back beyond the defeat of the WWI. So to me, German or Europe was to have a war with or without Hitler. Someone was bound to play that role. If the talker ever reads some history of WWII and of Hitler, the sentiment of antisemitism was not a creation of Nazi as many (particular my fellow Chinese) have falsely thought. So one thing the talk got it right, is that propaganda is a weapon of massive destruction, and that's exactly why I'm totally totally against any social propaganda led by the all mighty government regardless how wonderful the message may be and how wonderful the outcome in the future may be . Whatever it is advertising might lead everyone to paradise; but the means to achieve it, the way the message is communicated, can be seamlessly used to lead everyone to hell, because fundamentally such practice silents independent thinking and voice, and that is the worst one can do to himself, both in the scale of a society and in the scale of an individual. Creating needs IMHO, the talk completly misled audience to think that marketing and advertising is to manipulate consumer's mind so to make them believe they have a need. The example of orange juice is just terrible. It was true; but it is also true that marketer was nothing but the executor of a business desire driven by an industry, not the inventor. Everyone has this idea — to sell you something, I need to create a belief in you to feel good about having it. So just like any idea on this earth, ideas are cheap, the execution is the hard part . And when you talk about belief , well, there are only two ways to achieve that — propaganda (so you are soaked in a mono-tone message), or censorship. The end result is the same, that you are insulated from alternatives and different opinions, well, if yourself don't think! The public image of creditable people such as doctors and experts just to shape your view before you have one yourself. But don't you see how evil this practice is!!? No. Marketing and advertisement should not be this way. It started to bridge the gap between seller and buyer, where buyer already has a need and seller is providing the service. Yes, new needs are constantly evolving, shifting, marketing and advertising are researchers who discover them, not creating them. If you examine any of the examples quoted in this talk, you will realize any of the created-needs came from a human desire far deep than what marketer can influence — how about health? Yes, all the diet product, orange juice story, Q-10.. it's all about human wants to stay healthy. Period. It's the branch that grows these leaves, not the other way around. So when the talk is making it sound marketing has invented these needs (and is the success story for all future marketers to follow), I could not disagree more! Stop thinking marketing is to be super being who can form this world! That's the path leads to another dictator!! Instead, your mission is to have a deep insight of the human desire (psychology) and society (social study), and be the sensor of what is going on at this moment in this country, in this society, in this world. Evil politics want to control your mind and tell you what you like and dislike; marketer and advertisement should not be. They can become one only when you yourself let them. So pls do me a favor, don't.","tags":"thoughts","url":"https://fengxia41103.github.io/myblog/marketing.html"},{"title":"Luck","text":"I was listening to this talk on Youtube about luck, and that got me thinking. It's a cliche when people talk about luck, and someone gets lucky, or unlucky. It feels it is something we have no control over, and it is just randomly happened, for good and for bad. It is an easy execuse to make an unhappy reality tolerable, and a fortune justifiable. But in the end, no one can explain what brought that luck — granted, there have always been many theories on its coming, but the fundamental attribute of luck is that it is not predictable! That's right. I suddenly realized what a luck is — Luck only exists in a rear view mirror . There is no such thing as forward looking luck, or future luck, or you will get lucky , because the truth is, you don't know until it has happened and you already experienced the result, whatever it may be, pleasant or horrible. So why can't luck be something we can control, produce, maybe with a lot of effort, but at least there is a hope? No. What the word luck has become is actually a baggage of variables that can ONLY exist in the past, and they may have contributed to the final result. But there are two problems we simply do not have a method yet, nor a capacity, to make this reverse engineering effort possible: How do we know how many variables are there that contributed to this result? Literally there are infinite number of them, and each plays a role in the final showdown. If you think of it, the mere existence of you and me is an accumulated miracle over that many seconds of pure coincidence since birth to this very moment that I'm typing and you are reading. It is easy to come up with a correlation between a significant variable (we think) to the result. But too often one confuses correlation with causal relationship, and mistakenly took the former as the accepted answer. No! Correlation is by definition looking in the rear view mirror! It can not, will not, should not, and absolutely must not , be used to produce a deterministic next. There is no such a logic. Therefore, luck can only be explained and theorized , but not (yet) known beforehand. But I got curious. So often we say good luck with a sincere heart; we believe in religion and pray for miracles; we, everyone of us, get lucky sometimes. It's a wonderful feeling. Are we powerless in mastering our own destiny in this sense? Can we influence its trajectory through something like hard work, training, discipline, faith, diet, high spirit, good looking, fortune? After all, there are just so many things we don't like about our current existence — the result of a series of bad lucks , and we all wish to change our luck, to graze the grass on the other hill because they look greener. We constantly fight this desire for a better luck through painfully self-reminder that we should be happy with what we already have, and we label all those thoughts of wanting a change as desire , greed , immuture , 做 , which all convey a negative feeling that put us to shame. But if the urge of having a better luck isn't part of us, why doesn't it just go away? why did it come up even? This is strange, isn't it? So if luck is a summary of all the past, I think the computer model is actually pretty simple. We have a function, result = f(var1, var2, var3......) , and if only we could count in all the variables, and have enough samples to test this function. So far we can't have all the variables yet, because it feels everything is related — didn't turn right at a cross 10 years ago, well, it eventually leads to me being still alive, today! How far fetched it seems! but then, how true it is! Life itself is an accumulated decisions, and the funny thing is that we think some carry more weight than others, but the reality is that they are all the same! No one has a crystal ball, and no one can turn back the clock, so decision is a one way street. Therefore, what you choose today makes no difference whatsoever because there is no reference! You make a decision, then you move on. Whatever comes out of life, is the result=f(decision 1, decision 2, .... decison N) . Since we don't have a book writing down for each decision we made and linking them to what came out it after, we already lost track of this record, which in turn makes analysis impossible . So when people say luck , it is really nothing but a cherry-picked set of variables one decides to use to support his/her statement, nothing more than that! Therefore, luck, is really in the domain of subjective emotion than objective reality. The irony, however, lies when someone believes his success is not due to luck, but some deterministic methodology that can be replicated and re-iterated. That's pure BS. Just say you are lucky and move on — saying \"oh I was just lucky\" is a polite way to acknowledge the ignorance, which is the only truth. Seriously, can you write me this list of variables that are sufficient to generate the same result!? If you can not, you are just, lucky. Just don't fool yourself (and many audience, unfortunately) that you have a recipe. You can have a theory , however, and it's up to others to try that if they will. But selling your design of success is a lie. There you have it. Luck, only exists in the past. It's a representation of subjectively picked variables to establish a correlation between the past and a result. So in this sense, you can always feel lucky, and be lucky , if you want to.","tags":"thoughts","url":"https://fengxia41103.github.io/myblog/luck.html"},{"title":"Math, the decline of the US","text":"Came across an article tonight. The argument is actually not new — that US is now in decline and the only hard fact that no one is disagreeing, its leadership in technology , especially in computer related stuff, is shaken. The evidence, or its supporting argument, comes in two folds: that the education in American public school, in particular, its math education, is inferior to those in China. that US is losing magnetism to smart people: the US policy is becoming less and less friendly, its research funding is strained, and their home country is becoming the opposite of a and b. So this leads me to think just how logical this is? My question is, is US's leading edge based on a superior math capability, or imported talent (in many's mind, they also happen to be math wizard)? I'm sure math is absolutely the foundation of what we human know about this world. So is talents. Who doesn't like talent!? Any company does; any country does. Even any person wishes having some talents. Good education, of course. So if the US is losing its charm, and these smart people stop coming to the US, who can pick up the torch to continue pushing the boundary of technology? You know what. One thing I can be sure is that today's China is not ready. Technology is a tool, and will always be a tool. The description of a problem, is what matters. Question matters Think about how you acquire knowledge. Google search engine knows practically EVERYTHING. The quality of learning isn't about how much a knowledge database like Google knows, but how well you can form your question — garbage in, garbage out. The quality of the question really stands for how well you have understood the question/problem itself, and how detailed your work is. If you ask \"Google, how much is 1+1?\", you get a pin-point answer, exact, precise; if you ask \"Google, what is an addition?\" You get a lengthy answer that looks really complex, cool, but too general to be acted on; if you ask \"Google, how is integer addition done in binary format?\" There is clear definition of integer , binary , and addition . You get the picture. How to get clarity then? Challenge, debate, argue, fight, trial-and-error, and iterate. US is constructed to not only tolerate, but encourage such activities. Think of attorneys who is seeking every opportunity to arouse a class action; the hedge funds who prays for a company, good or bad, to make a mistake; the community townhall meetings that your neighbour complains your 2nd floor balcony invades her privacy because she enjoys walking in her house naked with curtains up for some sunshine... not to mention \"what does that mean?\" heard everywhere, all the time... this is a shout-out for definition, for clarity, for ruling out ambiguity, for exploring pros and cons as much as one's mind can carry, for scrapping every dark corner with an open eye and a magnifier, and this, is what can finally leads to a good question to ask, and only then it can lead to the answer . This, is how technology evolves; this, is why US is holding the torch. US can fail, and it probably will fail someday anyway. Country, is like a human, can't stay young and healthy 24x7 forever; it gets sick, it falls, it may even die. But whoever is 2nd in line must carry the same spirit because that is the only way — clarify your definition! Math matters So let's talk about math. What is the math? It's not about knowing 1+1=2 . It is a form of definition that is clear, precise, deterministic. So the math education, or education in general, isn't about how to solve a particular function; it's a clear description of a problem, thus the question. Once the question is defined, the solution becomes possible, and useful. Therefore, it becomes completly irrelevant when this type of articles are comparing how complex a 3rd grade math is. It is not the knowledge that matters; it is the thinking process that matters. Knowledge in today's world is nothing but fonts printed on paper. Literally, one can find ALL what human knows about in Google and Amazon books. Period. But forming and defining the question remains to be a formidable challenge. So regardless how US students are poop at math, they will come out on top as long as they learned the principle of what math really is — define your question precisely. Corrupted language I have talked about China's irresponsible response . That's exactly why I think it currently stands no chance in technology frontier. Today Chinese language is corrupted . People are proud of using fuzzy terms as if they show sophistication. They even brag that this is the beauty of this language. False! Chinese classic literature is exactly the opposite. It was concise, precise, and accurate. It was a clear definition of the things it was describing. The best user of this language were the ones who have formed a description of the question without any ambiguity. It is hardly up for interpretation; it is the exact moment and thought that the author was meant to deliver, even hundreds later, still clear, crispy and lively. So, when Chinese developers, their design documents, their response to clients, their requirements stop using the terms such as 某种程度 (to some degree), 或许 （probably）, 等等 (and so on), I will say their math education is now working.","tags":"thoughts","url":"https://fengxia41103.github.io/myblog/is%20math%20important.html"},{"title":"Data, Integrity","text":"The first time reading \"Trust\" by Francis Fukuyama , I was deeply impressed by his distinction that Chinese trust is implied, such as inner circle of immediate family, friends, extended through marriage... while the Western version is explicit, for example, the credit score system. Now we have data With China's economy boom and in particular the ever thirsty interest by the mass of any kind of financial leverage, the only barrier everyone agrees upon that is holding the lenders back to lend more and borrowers back to borrow more, is the lack of a personal credit score. How wonderful the world is going to be if only everyone has a credit score! even better, if that score is tracked and publicized and supervised and distilled by the almighty government, isn't it just a paradise on earth? Is it!? The concept is very enticing. This score, like what we have in the US, will hinder you from doing bad things, breaking laws, defaulting loans, dodging tax, and even being on welfare for too long — it is a force to stop your sin and encourage your virtue. You are rewarded for your good, and punished for you bad. Common sense. But China, what a magical land, just possess this infinite creativity to turn anything upside down. If 取其精华，去其糟粕 is a wisdom of how to learn new things, in practice the \"smart\" Chinese is doing the exact opposite. When I grew up in the 80s and early 90s, the main stream was filled with news and articles and classroom materials that were nearly 100% qualitative with little quantitative analysis to back up their statements. Legend from the dark age of the 60s and 70s was that data was manufactured on demand to serve a purpose, often political, therefore reflected little reality. Trained as an engineer and a believer in science , I found it ridiculous and felt sad about ppl who had to live with those lies. So things got really better in the past 10 years. Everywhere you turn, there is data, charts, Excel, application... and then the buzz — big data, data this, data that... if you can not include the word \"data\" in your sentence, you are just out, out of fashion, out of mind, and out of a trustworthy circle. What a turn! But that's exactly the part that annoys me. When you speak of data, when everything is data-driven, when any argument is now backed by some table, curve, statistics, when no data is too big and everyone thinks data holds the magic to solve any problem, do they know that this is the golden age of going digital, but the worse time for trust !? I read an article today that Alibaba installed a Sasame credit as a hope to lead the way to introduce credit score in everyone's life. However, you can pay some total stranger $70 to get a perfect score using his/her manufactured data (maybe someone else's data, who knows). Data integrity This isn't even ironic. This is fucked up. Most common reaction I believe is that things will be different if government is running this instead of a private commercial entity. And I'll argue that not only it will not make a difference, but it will be a terrible idea. Who is supervising the government!? Why is it trustworthy, at all!? What happens when it installs some BS like this social credit score with probably all the noble intention, but in the end became a lawless tool in government's hand to crush whoever it feels like!? Tell me, how to prevent that from happening besides praying for its conscience!? Come on. But my point isn't about politics at all. The root cause of this is not some bad apples who want to outsmart the system to make profit. It will always happen. It's human nature. The problem, is people fail to understand data itself means nothing, absolutely nothing, if it loses integrity . The credit score itself is the icing; the way to collect, process, cross-check to verify and validate these data, is the core that creates \"trust\". When clients want to build a system, the only principle he needs to understand is garbage in, garbage out . System is not smart. Data is not smart. Data generator, whoever that is, is smart. The power of a system is not at accumulating data; it's the ability to define and guard data integrity. Period. How to achieve that? Defining integrity is the job of human. It is domain specific and context sensitive. The analogy is that user agrees 1 plus 1 equals 2. Then data's job is make sure everywhere there is 1 plus 1, it flags it green if it equals 2, and flags red otherwise. Trust, but verify How to guard integrity? Cross checking. I love President Reagan's trust, but verify . How do you know your data is correct? Looking at them in multiple dimensions see if the result is consistent . Remember, garbage in, garbage out. This is literally a mental race between the system implementor and data manipulators. The cheapest, and also the most effective, way is to feed you garbage at the first place, and that's what's happening to this Seseame score. So my complaint is that people pick up an idea or a buzz word without looking further to its assumption, and rush to market it as if it's another silver bullet. The assumption is really what matters. For credit score, or any other data driven application/idea/concept, the data integrity is the assumption. It takes tremendous insight into the subject at hand, and a lot of disciplines to verify. Then and only then, it can create trust.","tags":"thoughts","url":"https://fengxia41103.github.io/myblog/data%20and%20credit%20score.html"},{"title":"Can you innovate?","text":"This has been a topic on my mind for quite some time now ever since I worked in Shanghai in 2016 and witnessed things that quite annoyed me, especially from a software engineer prospective. So the backdrop is that Chinese people have been encouraged by the country's phenomenal success in economy and are now moving from made in china to created in china — a sound idea, just like socialism or any other idea someone around the corner has. The idea is not the problem, the implementer is. Ideas are cheap. There is a problem xyz, easy. The challenge is how we are gonna find a solution for this problem, let alone a satisfactory one? Well, no one can really define that. Even when you talk about a working solution, the immediate argument will be what you mean by working ? How do you prove it works? This sounds more and more like an attorney's job now, doesn't it? Well, let's leave this philosophical dilemma and rant about why I was annoyed by this innovation wave. Pls, stop \"buzzing\" First, loading buzz words is not innovation. These days just walking into any coffee shop in Shanghai and locate any group of: more than 2 people (2 is more likely love birds chatting), age band between 20-40 using laptop instead of smart phone or tablet bonus: it's running a PPT super bonus: it's running code Yes, you have just found Latte entrepreneurs (love this name/ ref ). Get a cup of coffee and eavesdrop for a while, the buzz words are bound to flow in full strength: cloud computing , big data , sharing economy , amazon , google , BAT , R , AI ... Whatever the problem is, or even the solution might be, these are the most common denominators. I really shouldn't bash these ppl. After all they are thinking, and trying to create a solution. But I was deeply annoyed because — often than not they were using these words as if they were a magic potion ! Just drink it and your problem is solved. No! Their conversation barely scratched the surface of these technologies (which I highly suspect it is because they don't understand much of them, let alone first hand experience with them) and rarely you hear a voice cautioning about implication, downside, assumption and risk. But everybody knows that there is free lunch . Let's say cloud computing . Why cloud? what make a cloud? Yes there is the NIST definition , but that doesn't really mean anything to me if you can't relate it to your own context (the problem we are to solve) and explain (clearly): what will a cloud be used for how it is going to help which layer is going to help, and how that decision was made To the minimum, if you are thinking that building a cloud is more of a HW investment than SW, then you don't know what you are talking about. If you are to rent from services like AWS, then can you tell me what challenge you are most likely to run into (and I can tell you now it is not just money... no, not data security, nor privacy, nor vendor lock in... these are all valid points, but the real bummer, is the learning curve). Yes, people, brain . That will be the hardest asset to come by, and the most valuable in your org. AWS is a wonderful service. It is a Ferrari with a million dials. The magic word cloud computing is not going to just spit out a solution for you. It will help, dramatically, if you know how to tune those dials. Man! I can't tell you how many times I had to battle some Chinese IT fella in 2015 who wanted to sell his client an Oracle database (the swiss army knife of DB) but failed to come up a single example which feature of the Oracle is needed in his application, and why alternatives are inferior? Come on! if you are too lazy or just not good enough to set up an apple-to-apple evaluation, then all what you are saying about the wonderful things of Oracle, are just a word-of-mouth speculation. Domain silo The reason they took the buzz words as solution itself is that they are taking an easy way out — a sounded cure-fore-all instead of acquiring, analyzing and proving domain knowledge : How much do you really know the problem? and the context of the problem? What's the assumption you are taking to think of this as a problem? What method you used to analyze the cause of this problem? How do you support your argument? and how sound is your support, both qualitatively and quantitatively? My problem is that many conversations I have participated all went with roughly 30-min of problem discussion then went right into the grand future of the \"what if we get 10% of the 13-billion population using this!?\" How exciting! Of course, even selling a million toilet paper is an exciting business, and if you can figure out to sell them by the piece instead of roll, man, you will be a legend for sure . This is not innovation talk; this is a group opium high. Analyzing something is hard. As a matter of fact, any learning is hard. To understand the problem is the hardest part, if not the only thing it matters in an innovation. Most of us possess domain knowledge of some sort. The quick measure I would suggest is how much time you have spent in that domain. Time doesn't cheat, and practice does make one perfect. So even with a domain expert onboard, the process of knowledge sharing so the software guy can internalize the idea and in turn transform it into his domain expertise, eg. a software model and code, and transfer his thinking back to the team for verification and discussion — this back-and-forth process not only takes time, but is a steep learning on both sides. Most importantly, it takes both sides' willingness to learn in order to work. So for innovation, it's really a process of learning A LOT OF things which you have little knowledge before, and each must contribute to the pod with his/her sharing. Some of those will be easy to pick up; others, will be frustratingly difficult. If it takes 3 years for a highschool and a 4 years for a college, this mega-million-dollar big problem you are trying to solve can't be easier than those. Well, now look around, how many team members are excited about learning some coding, or accounting? Stop IT me If there is one theme of the buzz word section, it is the dominant relevancy of IT. Yes, software is everywhere; coding is a must have. But then, how many times I saw the poor coder sitting on the side the table, listening in silence, as if the idea flows one way — from business owner to IT implementation. In China, coders and their managers must have a love-hate relatinoship. They are needed (somehow), but nobody wants to pay him much. Even worse, nobody understands him. He lives without a style and is bad at speech; his jokes are dry; his need is not much; his skill is witch-like, from fixing an iPhone to writing an app, even sometimes a WORD or PPT; and the best of all, there are a dime of dozen of them in job market and by subway exit; whatever their coding language is, they can all do the same thing, and with the same quality, too — poor . This is really bizzare. Writing software is hard; writing quality one is really really really hard. By common sense you won't look at anyone speaking English to be a novelist, let alone a Shakespeare. But that's exactly the mentality these innovation teams or their investors have. So with such thoughts, on the one hand coders are necessity but certainly not a worthy investment , on the other hand coders lack proper mentorship in work to learn, develop and mature, so their deliveries proved the common bias — \"Look, this is scrappy produce/code... I'm totally overpaying you...\" sad, sad, sad. Chinese management and team setup are so used to the hierarchy they grow up with in school, in their previous jobs, and in the society overall, that this is the only format they know. But innovation, as we have argued, is depending on knowledge sharing, cross training, and mutual interest in each other's domain. Hierarchy not only makes information flow in one direction only, but enforces domain silo and ignorance which enpowers the seemingly superior position (mgt? founder? investor?) to legitimize its ignorance — \"Hey look, IT guy, I hired you because I don't know IT...\". So how to fix this? Stop using the word \"IT\"! It's an enormous topic under this umbrella that each consists of a technology that can be extremely challenging. If you are an IT guy, do you know database ? how about nosql ? and deployment? and performance tuning? clustering? modeling? driver?... and network? server? storage? virtualization?... So to make things straight, stop IT me . Let IT's voice be part of the contribution, not just a downstream magic pod that will turn idea into reality. Let everyone be practical and specific in term of their domain — yes I know something about Python and Django web framework; no, I don't know much about database, networking and storage. Same goes for HR, for business analyst, for product owner, for investor, and for everone who takes innovation seriously. Disruptive, not A byproduct of China's economy miracle is an impatience to realize a dream. Even worse, urban legends encourage one to be disruptive , because, just look around, how many new riches found their fortune by disrupting the traditional course with their ignorance and ego alone! The mentality of nothing is impossible is not a slogan, it's a common sense. But no, innovation is not, and can not be, disruptive. We have argued innovation is rooted in domain knowledge, and that knowledge forms the food chain we see today, which in turn brew the perceived problem. The instinct of redrawing the map to remove that problem is absolutely correct — it's like taking fish out of its tank. It will die. But the new map will have its own quirks, just you haven't seen them yet. So being disruptive in that sense is nothing but replacing the old, visible problems with a promise while repeating \"no problem no problem no problem...\" to your covered ears . Innovation is not magic. It can only be a system with feedback loop that can be continuously tuned. Like writing software, you always started with a version 1, and ended up with version 989287429 after that many iterations of trial-and-error. If you ignore (or downplay) the intermediates, viola, your end result looks absolutely innovative ! Think about Newton's apple, or Einstein's, or Google, or Amazon, great arts, or any disruptive technology/solution you have in mind, just look closer, read and research, you will find breadcrumbs all over its path. The last push gets all the glory, but the truth is that it's standing on the shoulder of a giant, and the ladder to climb is the spirals of continuous try-measure-tune-repeat . Innovating Yes I'm a tech guy and am on a perpetual learning curve of some new or unfamiliar technologies. With a growing age, I found myself even constantly on a review session of some old technologies — a command line I can't think of anymore after a couple month, a Python syntax that now eludes me and I have to google it — this is not even stackoverflow because SO is used only when I can ask a (smart) question that has passed Python 101. I'm talking about google python built-in function type of basics. Shame. But there are just so many pieces one needs to know in order to build a technology stack. So to me I'm constantly learning, constantly thinking, constantly re-inventing wheels or copying someone else's wheels, and constantly writing something new and fresh that only my brain is producing. Those last part, if being original and bearing a thought worth talking about, is my solute to innovation.","tags":"thoughts","url":"https://fengxia41103.github.io/myblog/can%20you%20innovate.html"},{"title":"Charm Ansible integration","text":"Let's face it. Ansible has the mouth (and market) share these days. For our modeling purpose, we are to utilize its procedural strength to carry out actions, which provides an abstraction instead of coding in charm's Python files. Design objectives: Design as reusable layer(s) Be compatible with Ubuntu and CentOS Simple pattern to execute a playbook Assumption: Playbooks will be local (in charm) so to maintain the atomic nature of a HW charm — the model contains both the declaration of attributes and actions to handle runtime state transitions. Method 1: layer-ansible Method 1 is to use an existing project, layer-ansible . Examine its code reveals a typical pattern one would use to introduce a new function: Install Ansible. The approach it took is to use a ppa:ansible/ansible source and installed by calling charmhelpers.fetch.apt_install . The key issue here is using ppa which is an hardcoded Ubuntu approach. ```python def install_ansible_support(from_ppa=True, ppa_location='ppa:ansible/ansible'): if from_ppa: charmhelpers.fetch.add_source(ppa_location) charmhelpers.fetch.apt_update(fatal=True) charmhelpers.fetch.apt_install('ansible') with open(ansible_hosts_path, 'w+') as hosts_file: hosts_file.write('localhost ansible_connection=local') ``` Helper function to execute. Clearly the approach here is to use subprocess.check_call which is calling ansible-playbook as CLI. This works fine but then think about all the CLI switches that ansible-playbook can take which in turn need to be exposed through this function ← currently it supports tags and extra-vars . ``` python def apply_playbook ( playbook , tags = None , extra_vars = None ): .... call = [ 'ansible-playbook' , '-c' , 'local' , playbook , ] if tags : call . extend ([ '--tags' , '{}' . format ( tags )]) if extra_vars : extra = [ \" %s = %s \" % ( k , v ) for k , v in extra_vars . items ()] call . extend ([ '--extra-vars' , \" \" . join ( extra )]) subprocess . check_call ( call , env = env ) ``` A nice feature of this library is the implementation of hooks and actions so that Ansible can answer to hook event and can be executed as action . Method 2: layer-myansible This method is inspired by this article . This is to take advantage of the Ansible Python API . Install prerequisites. Installing Ansible will fail on a vanilla Ubuntu because it misses a few dependencies. Using layer-basic by listing them out in layer.yaml : yaml includes: - 'layer:basic' options: basic: packages: - libffi-dev - libssl-dev - python - python3-dev Install Ansible. Use Python wheel supported by layer-basic . In wheelhouse.txt : ```shell ansible==2.2.0 ``` ansible.cfg . Instead of using a global config, this is local so each charm can have its own variation if desired. ``` shell [ defaults ] inventory = . / hosts log_path = / var / log / ansible / ansible . log remote_tmp = $ HOME / . ansible / tmp local_tmp = $ HOME / . ansible / tmp [ ssh_connection ] ssh_args = - o UserKnownHostsFile =/ dev / null - o StrictHostKeyChecking = no - o IdentitiesOnly = yes - o ControlMaster = auto - o ControlPersist = 60 s control_path = ~/ . ansible / cp / ansible - ssh -%% h -%% p -%% r ``` Options. Constructed a class to be the abstraction of Ansible options: ``` python class Options ( object ): \"\"\" Options class to replace Ansible OptParser \"\"\" .... verbosity = None , inventory = None , listhosts = None , subset = None , module_paths = None , extra_vars = None , forks = None , ask_vault_pass = None , vault_password_files = None , new_vault_password_file = None , output_file = None , tags = None , skip_tags = [], one_line = None , tree = None , ask_sudo_pass = None , ask_su_pass = None , sudo = None , sudo_user = None , become = None , become_method = None , become_user = None , become_ask_pass = None , ask_pass = None , private_key_file = None , remote_user = None , connection = None , timeout = None , ssh_common_args = None , sftp_extra_args = None , scp_extra_args = None , ssh_extra_args = None , poll_interval = None , seconds = None , check = None , syntax = None , diff = None , force_handlers = None , flush_cache = None , listtasks = None , listtags = [], module_path = None ``` Playbook execution. Running it is to use Ansible's API call PlaybookExecutor . ``` python self . pbex = playbook_executor . PlaybookExecutor ( playbooks = pbs , inventory = self . inventory , variable_manager = self . variable_manager , loader = self . loader , options = self . options , passwords = passwords ) .... self . pbex . run () ``` Charm integration Using layer-myansible for example, integrating with charm takes the followings: Include layer. In layer.yaml : ```yaml includes: - 'layer:basic' - 'layer:myansible' ``` Create a playbooks folder and place playbooks here: ```shell . ├── config.yaml ├── icon.svg ├── layer.yaml ├── metadata.yaml ├── playbooks │ └── test.yaml └── reactive └── solution.py ``` Using config.yaml to pass in playbook for each action that is defined in the charm states. For example, define test.yaml for an action in state-0 : ``` yaml options : state - 0 - playbook : type : string default : \"test.yaml\" description : \"Playbook for...\" ``` Define the playbook. For example, a hello world that will create a file `/tmp/testfile.txt'. ```yaml - name: This is a hello-world example hosts: 127.0.0.1 tasks: - name: Create a file called '/tmp/testfile.txt' with the content 'hello world'. copy: content=\"hello world\\n\" dest=/tmp/testfile.txt tags: - sth ``` Note that tags value sth must match playbook run call (see below). In charm .py file, from charms.layer.task import Runner , then in state-0 to call given playbook: ``` python playbook = config [ 'state-0-playbook' ] runner = Runner ( tags = 'sth' , # < -- must match the tag in the playbook connection = 'local' , # < -- must be \"local\" hostnames = '127.0.0.1' , # < -- assuming execution in localhost playbooks = [ playbook ] , private_key_file = '' , run_data = {} , become_pass = '' , verbosity = 0 ) stats = runner . run () ``` That's it. Now you can build a charm by including layer-myansible and run any playbooks in your charm by following this design pattern while taking full advantage of the Ansible Python API . Beautiful.","tags":"openstack","url":"https://fengxia41103.github.io/myblog/charm%20ansible%20integration.html"},{"title":"AI","text":"I have pretty low tolerance of BS. The hot topic of AI bothers me a great deal, because it is being discussed by too many ppl who have no context. It is becoming just another buzz word rolling off your tongue to make you sound sophisticated and smart. But no, AI is neither magic nor intimidating. I think it is a great example for human being to looking at things with a straight face, cut to the core, no more BS, no more hand waving and using some abstract, ideological fuzziness to fool ppl. At least 20 years ago I have read a line about artificial intelligence, which cleared formed my view on this — There are two ways to define intelligence : Machine emulate human's train of thoughts, and derives the same conclusion. Machine ignores your human brain, finds its own way, and arrive the same conclusion. The key is, the final result is the same . So how can you distinguish the difference? does process even matter? If we both doing math, 4 x 8 , human uses multiplication , you know what? computers know nothing about multiplications, to it, everything is an add , period. It will add these numbers that many times, but much much much faster than any human can do. For human, single digit has shortcuts, double digit multiplications takes a paper and pen, and when you are talking about a 12737-digit number multiplying another 28787-digit number, forget it. Computer is going to win, hands down, every, single, time. You know why? because to computer, 4x8 is the same as 29837497972 x 980987574009 , same method, same logic, repetitive of the same action. That's the beauty of it, isn't it? If you just look at this example closely, you will start to realize this isn't even a need for debate — the core of multiplication, or the true concept of multiplication, is addition. So putting the same lens over Alpha Go and its recently victories over all top players, I think it is exactly because the computer implementation of Go cuts down the BS around this game, which was used to be thought being an art of Zen, so philosophical, so hard to master, hard to comprehend, and the players are all god like beings. Well, here it is, computer engineers, as being a group of dumb and unsophisticated and simple-minded beings, looked at this game and said to themselves: \"What is this empror wearing?\" And this same line of story has been playing all over the human history. In speed, in energy, in any physical strength arena, we human have already accepted defeat. The only cover left for our pride is the so called intelligence , and losing this is making us feel uncomfortable. This is unnecessary at all. Just because no one has ever been able to decipher and define clearly what human intelligence is, it doesn't mean we are superior to machine. I actually think this progress in defeating the Go game is a wonderful lesson for human, for anyone who likes and enjoys to wrap themselves around with mystery so to feel good. If the empror is naked, so he is . If it looks great but no one can explain, it is nothing but a willingness to make yourself believe in. Alpha Go, just like addition vs. multiplication, gets us one step closer to what the core of Go is, after thousands of years of zen-ing of self-addiction. This is not only a feat of computer engineering and so called deep learning or AI or whatever fancy words you know, this is a giant leap for Go itself — machine is a challenger, a pile of cold-blooded emotionless solid-state electronics, a kid who shouted out \"Look he is, naked!\" Multiplication is a must in math concept, it has its use in many many ways. When machine derives the same answer by brute-force addition, it is not cheating, it is not intelligent either. It is merely anchoring the truth of that concept so human don't forget. Human intelligence, AI, same deal, no one is superior to the other. There is difference in efficiency, and there is difference in how objective one versus another. If someone loses his game, not because the machine is smarter, but because the group of ppl behind those machines are not satisfied with the given answer, and wanted to think deeper of inherited truth . Computer, just like any other mechanics and electronics human invented, are just tools to make the work more efficient. Tools don't crack the code, we do; computer doesn't make decisions, the writer of that if-else line do. # FACT: is he naked if have_clothes_on : naked = False ; else : naked = True ; # OPINION: does he look good if i_like_it : looking_good = True ; else : looking_good = False ; Here, computer identifies two variables representing two completly different dimensions. This is just my simplified view of the world when looking at the empror. If you mixed the two in your head, wow, it's a Dao, a Zen, a culture, a you-can-only-feel-it abstract, and that is when you start saying \"how wonderful his new gown looks!\"","tags":"thoughts","url":"https://fengxia41103.github.io/myblog/ai.html"},{"title":"Love till past","text":"很多人都i知道，浪漫的爱情里，两个人都怕时间太短，都说要长相守，两不忘。 最浪漫的话，是陪你慢慢变老。 Then this morning I had another thought. All families have some burdens that trouble them, regardless how wealthy they are, how wonderful they look to outsiders, how much love they have for each other. There just isn't one single, perfectly happy, worry-free, trouble-free, conflict-free family. But then, with dad's current condition, he doesn't understand these troubles anymore. What used to be a forbidden topic can now be safely said in front of him — grantedly he has his own world these days and that world isn't worry free either. However, he is not bothered by the worries that is troubling me. So I was thinking, the most romantic thing is not to accompany you till age, but to be with you till you don't remember the past anymore. 是的，就是这样的，不用慢慢的变老，是 陪伴着到有一天，那个人已经忘记，不再想起，想起了，你也认得出是回忆，但 不是从前的故事了，是另一段回忆里生长出来的世界，那个世界里，依然有 两个人，也是一半的幸福，一半的忧伤，那就真是陪着了，不变老，也不忘记。","tags":"thoughts","url":"https://fengxia41103.github.io/myblog/love%20till%20past.html"},{"title":"Teahouse","text":"This is an interesting thought. I am listening to this talk show about 三里屯, and guests are discussing the come and go of bars in this place. For those who don't know this place, it's a section in BJ that has a lot of bars which aggregated young ppl and foreigners. What's interesting of the topic is when a guest mentioned about bars in Europe, for example, that had its good days and bad days. Yet it's still there after 30, 40 years. The owner is now a middle age man instead of a young fella, and the place is still running, even with a taste of similar food, similar decoration, a few more photos that ppl can recognize the link between then and now, a trace of heritage. Doesn't this description remind you the well-known play, Teahouse 茶 馆 ? The backdrop of the play was a turmoil era in the Chinese history when the world was experiencing the WWI and WWII. Many were lost, disrupted, changed. In the play, the teahouse was passed down from generation to generation, business as usual, ppl all know each other, and time seemed stopped. Then, it all went down when the war started, the era changed, the ppl fought to survive, and the ugly and the beauty went upside down. What makes me think now is, isn't it a sign of maturity and stability, thus an overall prosperity for the society, that the existence of such a lasting heritage represents? But then, isn't change inevitable so it's fruitless to fight against it? Isn't stopping the clock a scare? I don't know. People in change are longing for stability; people in stability are longing for a change. This applies to marriage, to jobs, to a life style, to even a dress code and a fashion.

I am at the nursing home eating, and suddenly realized the color of the book cover that I'm reading is nearly identical to the color of the food containers. You know what? I have never noticed this color before, nor would ever thought I will give it a second thought. But then looking up, there it is, again, lying around me, without me ever seeing it. What is this color? #F6CEF5 is the closest my eyes can tell. But men are known to be insensitive to colors. So I'm not sure how accurate this number reflects what I saw. I have thought this color really cheezy , but it speaks to me in a way like never before, and I couldn't help wondering that your life is marked by various ppl with their leftovers, some left a smile, some left a sadness, some a regret, some a long lost friendship, some a music, and another a color. I know there is color theory that some are matching with others which please the eyes while other combinations don't. Then there is the cold color vs. hot color, blue for depression and red for passion. What is this color? What does it stand for? I can't even think of a physical thing that is in this color, yet it is here, everywhere. It reminds me icecream, but it isn't cold or cool or sugary. It feels, mixed, confused, puzzled. I thought it was pink, but is it also purple? If colors arouse certain emotion, what we feel everyday while walking on the street? Is the brain even processing or capable of processing all these colors? I always find the SH streets too noisy for my tastes, not just the crowd, the noise, the constant fluctuation of ppl, all kinds of ordinary and strange activities, and then, here they are, overwhelming display of colors — from clothes, from billboards, from everybody walking towards you and everyone passing you by. The old depressing time was marked by three dominant colors — white, black and gray. No one wanted that back. But now have you thought we have too many colors? is there such a thing as too many colors? what does it feel like? why does it mean to us?

So I was walking across this giant intersection, and I do mean giant because everytime I had to put in the high gear and used my dash speed at the first moment the walking sign turned green in order to barely make to the other side, provides there were many cars making their right turn and cut me off in the middle of the intersection. Let's put this way, to walk across these modern looking six-lane intersection is a matter of courage, full mindness of being ready to die, or fight, and a secret pray that the drivers will let you pass, or the guy next to you will block the hit for you. This doesn't sound good. So SH puts out an army of social workers on the street to manage these intersections. They can be spotted with uniform and often a flag in hand. I was just starting the dash when the uniform turned to me and clearly warned me to use the zebra line. The zebra line is a good 20 steps away from where I was, and with the cutting throat of count down I have with the walking sign, that's a lot to afford. Well, well, being a good citizen of nobody, I moved towards the zebra line. Then all of sudden, it came to me. That's it! This is what is wrong with zebra line. Everbody knows the line is meant to protect the pedestrians. But watch, the cars turning to this direction were making the right without slowing down a bit! A few approached cautiously were not gonna stop either. They were reluctantly brought to a halt because a few brave souls in front of me walked on with a spirit of \"you stop or dare you I have a gun\". So if the cars were not observing pedestrians on the zebra line, what's the point of asking us to use it, and take it one step further, what is the point of having the line at all!? To me, it felt almost like aggregating all the dispersed pedestrians onto the lines so the drivers have an easy time to aim and fire in batch mode. Or maybe the line provides camouflage of some sort that does make me invisible, or invincible, or maybe a special power to battle the upcoming steel. Well well, that's quite an imaginative wish, isn't it? Zebra line is really a form a social contract . Like any other contract, both parties enter the deal must hold their ends in order for the contract to work. If any drops the ball, the other one will have no incentive to (and should not) observe the contract anymore, and that's exactly what is going on with these zebra lines. What's the point of asking me to step on the zebra line when nothing is stopping those cars? Instead, let's cancel the turn-right signal while there is a walking sign on. No more opportunist. When I walk, all cars that can cut in the zebra lines get red light, period. Until drivers learn to give pedestrians a safety zone, they pay the price in form of longer wait for their ignorance and arrogance. Oh, and please make the walk timer longer. If the city is troubled by ever growing number of cars which made these giant intersections necessary, pedestrians should be encouraged, not defeated.

Identity? I see people in the middle of the social rung are all searching for something. Waking up this morning and walking on the street, the place was certainly busier after the holiday, more ppl, more cars, more purpose. Do ppl at the bottom of the rung bother with a purpose in life? and if you look at the social spectrum, can I say there are only two ppl who are probably not bothered by this question — the two at each extreme of the spectrum, then everyone else fall into the middle , so called middle class? But I don't believe the richest of the rich is anxiety free either. He has his own problems, just that I don't know. It's too far away form the life I know of that the problem is keenly true to him, but irrelevant to me. Well, almost so, until by the pattern of history, his trouble and his struggle will flow into my life at some point and make my life uncomfortable, too. But that's like Nth degree of indirection. So as far as I'm concerned, his trouble stays in his life, and I get mine. I know everybody is looking for something. The most recent thought I have is that people are looking for an image of themselves, someone that they want to be, living the life they want to have. I can't say she is searching for the meaning of life. Life can be quite meaningless . After all it's a subjective judgement — yours vs. mine. Your life might be wonderfully exciting, to you, but quite meaningless, to me. So what is this image or life that everybody is looking for? I know everyone has a different opinion. But why two ppl will fall in love? Do they have a similar image of life in mind? At the moment of romance they certainly thought they do. But how come the images always become further apart after a while, even after they have been living together for a while, sometimes a long time? Did their images change? Why didn't they stay in sync? You would think that after they went through many things in common in their lives, they would now share more and more of the same projections of being, which I suppose should bring them closer and closer. But no. More likely they find each other's pitfalls that doesn't fit with the image, and the initial thought of similarity became conflict, and they walk apart, live apart, love apart. How sad. But why? I have been watching young lovers sitting at food table, while one of them would pull out the iphone (or whatever) and.. and there is no and . The person isn't really doing much actually. She (pardon me, let me use \"she\" for the convenience of writing) will scroll, scroll, chat, chat, flip from screen to screen, click an icon to launch an app, shut it down after maybe 10 secs, flip, flip, click another icon, launch back the chat, no message, switch..... that's really boring! and she is really bored! And the guy would be on his phone, playing games? chatting with friends? or doing same boring finger dance? I don't get it. When two ppl spending time together at breakfast or dinner, it's a commitment to me, that I'm willing to spend these minutes of my life, with you. I have so much to say, to comment, to share with you, just watch the ppl coming in and out this place, aren't they fascinating? The girl standing at the corner has a wonderful legs. The guy ordering food has obnoxious attitude, and he didn't bathe before leaving home this morning, how can any girl want to touch or kiss him? but then his wife (or gf, or whatever) has a nice dress, and they have a baby! How could that be? Doesn't the woman deserve someone, better? but she looks, satisfied, and bored? And I like watching you, with your fine hair, your eyes sparkling with you, the only sparkle you can have, and how wonderful this is.... there are just sooooo much to talk about, to go around, to spend this time, together, truly, together, not just two well-known-to-each-other strangers each owns a fancy mobile phone. For God sake anyone can own a phone like that if s/he chooses so, but not everyone can spend the time with her, with him, with you . I heard the sign of lost love and lost passion is when two have nothing to talk about. How sad, the sound of silence. Not that there isn't all the interesting things around, they are still there. But you mentally shutdown and are not willing to open up your mind anymore. Why? Because the other person doesn't agree with you? and the conversation turns into an argument which you don't want to repeat for the thousandth time? what about the image of yourself now? What is the image you have in mind? someone who is looking for an applause, a supporter, a fan? If so, isn't it rather childish to think that way? or is it? Doesn't everybody wants to be agreed upon, especially by the one who is the closest? wait, didn't that person become the closest to you because s/he used to agree with you, all the time? So what you are truly looking for is the sense of recognition then. Is it replaceable by something else other than the person sitting next to you? Why s/he carries so much weight and you are so eager to get his/her approval? What if one day s/he challenges you? will you feel abandoned? is that how breakup works? Too many questions, zero answer. It's ok. One thing I know is that time is the most precious gift one can give. Time is given to everyone, but no one can make more. If I spend these seconds with you, that's what I want to have, want to have you in my life, want to have the memory of you in my life, want to take over the many seconds of your life too. My life becomes shorter, so is yours, and we both give a few seconds of ourselves, to each other. Isn't it better than any gift or present or handbags or roses or whatever? If you still love, even just yourself, give the piece of your life to that person, whose hand you just held, whose night you just spent with, whose skin you just touched, whose name you just said, whose smell you just can't forget, whose will to share that segment of memory with you, fully. Don't busy yourself with the boring phone, really. If you have the power to revert time or wipe it clean afterwards, your time is actually more than what I can imagine. But for now, if you are a walking body with all the fits and emotions and desires like I have, please, look at him, look at her, how wonderful that is, that this human being, also chose to have you, in memory, in life, in time.","tags":"thoughts","url":"https://fengxia41103.github.io/myblog/sound%20of%20silence.html"},{"title":"Girl's love","text":"Watching all the little kids running around at this public square in a summer evening, I was thinking to myself, \"boy, that's a lot of kids.

Especially for the guys, many of them look really crappy, no athletic build, no manly atmosphere, no intelligence in the eyes, staring at his mobile phone like a zombie, nearly indifferent to his wife and his kid(s), and no interest to the activities around him. The women are slightly better. But many of them dressed poorly, too, I should say dressed with a poor (strange) taste to my eyes. And they usually sit with their mom who played the role of a babysitter. I couldn't sense the passion between the two people anymore, they don't touch, they don't hold hands, they don't walk side by side, they don't necessarily talk. They hang out together, stroll together, usually with at least one of them married to the stupid smart phone. Isn't this sad!? However, the women didn't look sad. They looked quite content. So they are satisfied with the setup, the husband, the kid, the life? I couldn't tell. One thing strikes me is that since they accepted the guy to bear a child, the guy was quite acceptable. Therefore, the urban legend and social trend of women having trouble to find a mate really has nothing to do with girls being picky then. Girls are not picky, and these running kids are the running proofs. The picky girls are themselves choosing to stay away from these guys because the guys don't have the qualities they are looking for. I think these are the smart ones, really, because if you ever pay a slightest attention to these guys, they really don't have much to offer, well, besides his bio organ and his billion sperms. I don't know. I'm confused. I don't know these people so I shouldn't judge a book by its cover. The guys might be a sweet lover and a romantic angel and a sex machine and a millionaire and... and the woman might be a simple-minded female whose ideal is to have a family, a kid, a husband on paper or who smoke or spit on the floor or eating with pia pia sound or a crappy observation of life or .... I don't know. They liked each other, that's what matters. Now they have kids, and they are still together. Isn't this reality better than any of my imagined happy life? Isn't it just the happy life I am imagining and longing to have? This is truly confusing. The legend has that girls are beautiful, delicate, and always trying to pick the best out of all guys she has. They are wonderful beings that deserve all the care, attention and love to cherish them. So guys continuously strive to become his best so not to disappoint his girl. However, watching all these kids around, I couldn't help feeling that girls are not aiming high at all. On the contrary they aim pretty low, and they are willing to have a kid with a guy without any of these legendary attachments involved. She has a passionate night, gets a baby, then settles with the guy regardless of all her so called standards . They are irrelevant now. And whoever get her at the moment, becomes the lucky guy. Is this how girls love? If so, this is really really really sad.","tags":"thoughts","url":"https://fengxia41103.github.io/myblog/girl%20love.html"},{"title":"Charm layer-basic","text":"Have you ever wondered what layer-basic is for? and why every charm needs to include it? In this article we will take a look at its code base to decipher this mystery. Hooks We already know hooks are hardcoded. Juju expects certain hooks and hook sequence is always executed in an order that is dictated by Juju code. Sequence of charm hooks What do we see in hooks? If you run charm build and examine the dist folder, hooks live in dist/yourcharm/hooks folder: . ├── config-changed ├── hook.template ├── install ├── leader-elected ├── leader-settings-changed ├── relations │ └── rack-pdu │ ├── __init__.py │ ├── interface.yaml │ ├── provides.py │ └── requires.py ├── start ├── stop ├── update-status └── upgrade-charm We know we haven't defined any custom hook code for this charm, so how were they generated? Even more interesting is that all hooks are strangely identical . Take install hook script for example: #!/usr/bin/env python3 # Load modules from $JUJU_CHARM_DIR/lib import sys from charms.layer import basic # This will load and run the appropriate @hook and other decorated # handlers from $JUJU_CHARM_DIR/reactive, $JUJU_CHARM_DIR/hooks/reactive, # and $JUJU_CHARM_DIR/hooks/relations. # # See https://jujucharms.com/docs/stable/authors-charm-building # for more information on this pattern. from charms.reactive import main sys . path . append ( 'lib' ) basic . bootstrap_charm_deps () basic . init_config_states () main () You can diff all of them, and they are all the same! and they are all copies of the hook.template . The from charms.layer import basic actually clearly states that these hooks are depending on layer-basic . There, is why all charms are using it. This actually gives us a clue to further investigate how dependent charms are to layer-basic . It turned out not as necessary as we thought. charm build Source of charm build is here . Looking into the charm Builder class: class Builder ( object ): \"\"\" Handle the processing of overrides, implements the policy of BuildConfig \"\"\" HOOK_TEMPLATE_FILE = path ( 'hooks/hook.template' ) Ah ha, that's where it is expecting hook.template . Following this we have discovered the followings: Relatioin hooks and storage hooks are dynamically generated. For this to work, at least one layer must provide hook.template . The interesting point is that it doesn't relie on layer-basic anymore. If you charm has a /hooks/hook.template , it will work. ```python def plan_interfaces(self, layers, output_files, plan): ...... if not meta and layers.get('interfaces'): raise BuildError( 'Includes interfaces but no metadata.yaml to bind them') elif self.HOOK_TEMPLATE_FILE not in output_files: raise BuildError('At least one layer must provide %s', self.HOOK_TEMPLATE_FILE) ``` If you didn't define those must-have hooks, eg. install hook, charm build will happily make the dist, but it will fail at run time. What is happening!? It turned out charm binary has an option to make proof , and this will complain if you miss expected hooks ( bug #325 ), but the proof isn't part of the charm build process. Code expected hooks: ```python lint.check_hook('install', hooks_path, recommended=True) lint.check_hook('start', hooks_path, recommended=True) lint.check_hook('stop', hooks_path, recommended=True) if os.path.exists(os.path.join(charm_path, 'config.yaml')): lint.check_hook('config-changed', hooks_path, recommended=True) else: lint.check_hook('config-changed', hooks_path) ``` charm proof will catch the missing hooks: ``` shell fengxia @fengxia - xenial - dev : ~/ workspace / wss / charms / charm - pdu $ charm proof I : metadata name ( pdu ) must match directory name ( charm - pdu ) exactly for local deployment . W : no copyright file W : no README file I : relation rack has no hooks I : missing recommended hook install I : missing recommended hook start ``` If charm is executed, install hook will run first, which then call two functions from layer-basic : basic.bootstrap_charm_deps() basic.init_config_states() Let's take a look them respectively. boostrap_charm_deps This function is to setup the host Python environment for charms. charm-pre-install : execute any nested file named charm-pre-install under an exec.d folder. It uses check_call so any script will work. Once the script has been executed without error, a hidden file .{}_{}.done'.format(module_name, submodule_name)) will be created so the same preinstall script will only run ONCE → this is the way to make the execution only once regardless the sequence of hooks. Therefore whoever runs it once will write this file as breadcrumb for others to check. Install packages in wheelhouse folder. Again, if this has run, a hidden file wheelhouse/.bootstrapped is created so all these packages are installed ONCE (reference: distutils , easy_install ). In wheelhouse.txt file: ```shell pip>=7.0.0,<8.2.0 charmhelpers>=0.4.0,<1.0.0 charms.reactive>=0.1.0,<2.0.0 ``` Install python-virtualenv if it is included in config.yaml . init_config_states This is where charms will start using Juju commands (via charmhelpers lib) to set states with Juju controller. I'm copying the codes below since they are fairly self-explanatory. Unlike bootstrap_charm_deps , there is no magic file or flag to prevent this block executed multiple times. This makes sense since each hook can potentially modify charm states, thus run this in each hook is necessary. def init_config_states (): import yaml from charmhelpers.core import hookenv from charms.reactive import set_state from charms.reactive import toggle_state config = hookenv . config () config_defaults = {} config_defs = {} config_yaml = os . path . join ( hookenv . charm_dir (), 'config.yaml' ) if os . path . exists ( config_yaml ): with open ( config_yaml ) as fp : config_defs = yaml . safe_load ( fp ) . get ( 'options' , {}) config_defaults = { key : value . get ( 'default' ) for key , value in config_defs . items ()} for opt in config_defs . keys (): if config . changed ( opt ): set_state ( 'config.changed' ) set_state ( 'config.changed. {} ' . format ( opt )) toggle_state ( 'config.set. {} ' . format ( opt ), config . get ( opt )) toggle_state ( 'config.default. {} ' . format ( opt ), config . get ( opt ) == config_defaults [ opt ]) hookenv . atexit ( clear_config_states ) def clear_config_states (): from charmhelpers.core import hookenv , unitdata from charms.reactive import remove_state config = hookenv . config () remove_state ( 'config.changed' ) for opt in config . keys (): remove_state ( 'config.changed. {} ' . format ( opt )) remove_state ( 'config.set. {} ' . format ( opt )) remove_state ( 'config.default. {} ' . format ( opt )) unitdata . kv () . flush () Conclusion layer-basic is the foundation of charm building because it provides the entry point to call preinstall scripts, to setup the host Python environment and to initialize charm states. It has many hardcoded lines for using apt-get CLI and expecting an Ubuntu environment. These have been addressed somewhat in python2 charm . Going forward, the code base can use some work to support host other than Ubuntu and Python2 instead of 3.","tags":"openstack","url":"https://fengxia41103.github.io/myblog/charm%20layer-basic.html"},{"title":"Irresponsible response","text":"Doesn't the title sound like a tongue twister? That's where the irony is. How can you make a response irresponsible ? and what does it give? Any harm done? Does it matter? What does it mean when it happens? Why do ppl give such response? and why would ppl accept them? or do they? The play The whole thing started one morning when I was sitting in this noodle shop eating breakfast. A woman walked in and ordered a fried dish. Cashier girl: This dish needs wait. Woman: Oh, how long would that be? Cashier girl: They just started cooking them. The conversation ended there. Strange! well, at least to my ears, this is really really strange, and frustrating, and maddening, and is the root cause of everything that you don't like about this society, this country, this life. Really. The woman was certainly not satisfied with the response. However, she didn't pursue. Obviously she asked the question because she wanted to decide whether she wanted to wait for this dish (if wait time is acceptable to her) or switch do a different one. The cashier girl, however, was completly content with her response and felt nothing was wrong with the conversation. As a matter of fact, this so called chinese ambiguity is highly praised, sometimes, by ppl who genuinely feel that's the art of the Chinese language, the Chinese culture, the Chinese way. Well, you know what? That's totally BS. Because if you think of the root of a question, you don't ask a question like this for pleasure and to kill time. With the context of the scene, apparently the question was information seeking so that the woman can make a decisioin — wait for this, or not. We have all learned in 2nd grade (or experience with learning another language) what is the proper way to answer a question. Q : Does the train leave at 5? A : No, the train is running late. It will probably leave at 5:10. But the cashier girl's answer, on the other hand, convey zero information to help the decision making. Instead, she not only dodged the bullet, but throw the ball back to the woman and put her brain on a spin now: Woman: If it just started, how long does it usually take? Five minutes? Maybe I can wait. But what if it takes longer than that, I could instead get the other one, then I'll be home sooner so I can feed my cats. They must be hungry by now. But I wanted a taste of this dish, if only it won't take too long..... The pattern By the end of the day, she still doesn't know how long she will wait, and she could only make her move based on what I call blind assumption . Doesn't this phrase sound familiar? Yes, 拍脑袋做决定. So many times at work Chinese clients and colleagues complained about authority making decisions without having a good understanding of the problem, and the decisions then led to the misery that they were suffering from — failures of the project, poor quality of the product, and disrespect by management against their profession. But have they ever taken a step back and ask themselves, have they given the response like the cashier girl's? In a recent project, the company canceled a project after months of effort. I asked the Chinese colleague for a clue, and the answer was that marketing and sales actually voiced against this project at the very beginning, but the R&D in US didn't get the implied message . So the marketing and sales threw up their hands in the air, just like that girl — I warned you, so whatever you end up with is not my responsibility anymore. To make the explanation sound sophisticated, they added that \"you know, it's the Chinese way. We can understand the message well, but they didn't get it.\" How wonderful. It's cultural, it's language, it's you, silly. This is exactly the same pattern, isn't it? So why didn't she give the straight answer? After all, she is the one who works there so she was in position to estimate an average wait time better than anyone random customer. And even more ironic was that she started the warning that \"you need to wait for this dish\", but then shunned the question. Why? One word, responsibility . The warning was not raised to help the customer. Instead, it was habitually said to offload responsibility — I have warned you, therefore any negative result was not my problem anymore. How witty but totally disgusting!? The answer . Needless to say, she made a superficial response without even addressing the face value of the question. Service? what service? They always say putting yourself in customer's shoes . That's what service is about. A service orientated spirit will make her actively anticipate customer's underline anxiety ← She was apparently on a hurry. Why so? How long would she be willing to wait? Could I recommend something else to help her situation? → you see, this will lead to many follow up questions, if she was there to serve the customer, not just being a human cash register. To me, the bare minimum she could have said was I don't know. Chef would know that. and if taking one step further, she could ask the chef on behalf. Well, she didn't do any of these because this requires a few more rounds of interaction, an information seeking on behalf the customer, and taking a responsibility of the message said: Cashier girl: They just started cooking. It usually takes 5-6 minutes. You can also try our xyz which also tastes good and is ready now. The courage Yes, making straight answer takes guts. You say what you mean, and you mean what you say. You stand behind your statement with a sense of responsibility that you take pride and not afraid of being proven wrong. More than this, you make those statement because you are actively engaging the customer to understand their needs, did homework so you have a fair confidence in your recommendation, and make those recommendation in order to make their life better through your service. It is easy to play the word game that gets you off the hook. But please, stop dressing it up with the Chinese culture, the Chinese language, the Chinese characteristic . There is nothing to be proud of in this sense, because that type of response is not only irresponsible, but a complete waste of life — at the end of that conversation, the woman knew nothing new, and girl knew nothing new either. Next customer who wanted to know the wait time for this dish, same ignorance, or same safe answer. The conversation might as well never happened from both parties' point of view. And the cashier girl felt great, until she walked out her restaurant and met with all the other irresponsible responses threw at her by others, unconsciously as she did, and helped nothing with her decision makings in life. Well, if only one can live without making decisions. But, isn't everyday filled with nothing but million decisions to make? That's life. So next time, remind yourself, give straight answer, even it is a \"I don't know\". I don't believe the beauty of the Chinese language lies in its low efficiency, and there is a difference between I didn't get the message vs. you didn't tell me . Implication? You know there is another name for it — up for interpretation. It's fun, until it blows up. Q: Help! I need help! I'm shot... 911: I'm on my way! Will be there 5 minutes. Calm down, keep pressure on the wound, take deep breath.... Yes, make straight answer, clear instruction, think, I mean really think, for your customer. Your service isn't there because there is a position called XYZ. It's there to help ppl, so next time, put a bit of yourself into it. Responsibility doesn't kill you. It makes you brave, proud, and respectful.","tags":"thoughts","url":"https://fengxia41103.github.io/myblog/irresponsible%20response.html"},{"title":"Juju charm Python2","text":"Python 2. So we dived into charm code to see which feature is blocking on P2 so we can run charms in CentOS. Why do we want to build Python2 charms? Charms are claimed to built for Python3. However, the catch is that charms are also built for Ubuntu ecosystems ONLY if you care to examine its code base. Take __init__.py in charmhelpers/charmhelpers for example: try : import six # flake8: noqa except ImportError : if sys . version_info . major == 2 : subprocess . check_call ([ 'apt-get' , 'install' , '-y' , 'python-six' ]) else : subprocess . check_call ([ 'apt-get' , 'install' , '-y' , 'python3-six' ]) import six # flake8: noqa Command line apt-get is a clue, isn't it? There are many such hardcoded lines who shout out that Ubuntu is the way to go, and of course, charms are developed by Canonical, and you are expected to use them the way they were designed for. Well, this is fine until you want to deploy them on CentOS . CentOS challenge CentOS and RHEL remain to dominate enterprise. CentOS7 is shipped with Python27. We enabled EPEL-RELEASE repo, but then charm install gave us an error no module yum found . The call is made in charmhelpers/fetch.centos.py , and python34 has no yum module! import yum And trace it one step further, it came from charm-helpers/charmhelpers/fetch/__init__.py : if __platform__ == \"ubuntu\" : apt_cache = fetch . apt_cache apt_install = fetch . install apt_update = fetch . update apt_upgrade = fetch . upgrade apt_purge = fetch . purge apt_mark = fetch . apt_mark apt_hold = fetch . apt_hold apt_unhold = fetch . apt_unhold get_upstream_version = fetch . get_upstream_version elif __platform__ == \"centos\" : yum_search = fetch . yum_search Here we are making a mapping between defined function definitions and the function names that will be used in other places in the lib. Needless to say, CentOS definitions are missing a lot comparing to Ubuntu's. So yes, import yum is just the tip of the iceberg, execution will break anywhere apt_ is called. Take apt_install for example, here is a search result where this function is expected: -*- mode: grep ; default-directory: \"~/workspace/wss/hack/charmhelpers-0.15.0/\" -*- Grep started at Sat May 27

) at Sat May 27 22 :32:10 Enough proof that default charms will break. Let's see how to fix it. Python2 fix Strategy: make a charm Python2 compatible. This can be broken down to the following steps: Use python27 (in hooks). Change python search path in hooks. Map apt_ function for CentOS in charmhelpers . Update RelationBase class definition charms.reactive lib to use Python2 syntax. Update layer-basic . Python27 in hooks If you run charm build and search python3 in dist folder, the first offender are hooks: #!/usr/bin/env python3 change to : #!/usr/bin/env python The root cause is actually the hook.template , which is used in a copy-paste fashion to create the list of default hooks if user didn't define one. Remember, the hooks are hardcoded, and certain hooks will always be created! sys.path in hooks Update Python search path used in all hooks: # Load modules from $JUJU_CHARM_DIR/lib import sys sys . path . append ( 'lib' ) change to : # Load modules from $JUJU_CHARM_DIR/lib import sys import os sys . path . append ( os . path . join ( os . getcwd (), 'lib' )) Btw, don't be fooled by the comment line $JUJU_CHARM_DIR , there isn't one. Otherwise, there is no need to make this change. Function mapping in charmhelpers Update charmhelpers/fetch/__init__.py to add CentOS function mappings: if __platform__ == \"ubuntu\" : apt_cache = fetch . apt_cache apt_install = fetch . install apt_update = fetch . update apt_upgrade = fetch . upgrade apt_purge = fetch . purge apt_mark = fetch . apt_mark apt_hold = fetch . apt_hold apt_unhold = fetch . apt_unhold get_upstream_version = fetch . get_upstream_version elif __platform__ == \"centos\" : yum_search = fetch . yum_search # ADD: centos mapping apt_install = fetch . install apt_upgrade = fetch . upgrade apt_update = fetch . update apt_purge = fetch . purge apt_cache = fetch . yum_search RelationBase in charms.reactive Update class RelationBase in charms.reactive/charms/reactive/relations.py : class RelationBase ( object , metaclass = AutoAccessors ): \"\"\" The base class for all relation implementations. \"\"\" change to : class RelationBase ( object ): __metaclass__ = AutoAccessors layer-basic layer-basic is inherited in all charms. We will have a separate analysis on this lib alone. For now, let's take it for granted and work around the issues to make Python2 charms. Diff file list: Files layer-basic/bin/layer_option Only in /home/fengxia/workspace/wss/charms/layer-basic/lib/charms: __init__.py Files layer-basic/lib/charms/layer/basic.py Files layer-basic/lib/charms/layer/execd.py sys.path in layer_option Update layer-basic/bin/layer-optioin . This is the same change made in hooks. import sys sys . path . append ( 'lib' ) change to : import sys import os sys . path . append ( os . path . join ( os . getcwd (), 'lib' )) Python import path Touch an empty file layer-basic/lib/charms/__init__.py → make Python2 search path work. basic.py Changes to this file look intimidating (showing diff -r old new). However, the theme is quite straightforward: Install python2 modules, eg python-setuptools , as prerequisite to prepare the environment ( bug #97 ). The correct binary path for your pip . Use platform.linux_distribution()[0] to determine host platform. apt uses --assume-yes , where yum uses --assumeyes . There are mixed apt_install ( bug #98 ) using the mapped function and direct check_call shell calls. Moving forward, we should consolidate all package functions to mapped version. 6a7 > import platform 51,56c52,77 < apt_install([ < 'python3-pip', < 'python3-setuptools', < 'python3-yaml', < 'python3-dev', < ]) --- > me = platform.linux_distribution()[0] > if 'ubuntu' in me.lower(): > apt_install([ > 'python3-pip', > 'python3-setuptools', > 'python3-yaml', > 'python3-dev', > ]) > elif 'cent' in me.lower(): > # if using python3 > #apt_install([ > # 'redhat-lsb-core', > # 'python34-setuptools', > # 'python34-pip', > # 'python34-yaml', > # 'python34-devel', > #]) > apt_install([ > 'epel-release', # must > 'redhat-lsb-core', > 'python-setuptools', > 'python-pip', > 'python-yaml', > 'python-devel', > ]) > 64c85,88 < series = lsb_release()['DISTRIB_CODENAME'] --- > try: > series = lsb_release()['DISTRIB_CODENAME'] > except: > series = 'centos7' 66a91 > pip = vpip 68c93,96 < apt_install(['virtualenv']) --- > # pip = 'pip3' # if using python3 > pip = 'pip' > check_call([pip, 'install', '-U', '--no-index', '-f', 'wheelhouse','pip']) > check_call([pip, 'install', 'virtualenv']) 74d101 < pip = vpip 76c103,104 < pip = 'pip3' --- > # pip = 'pip3' # if using python3 > pip = vpip 83,84c111,114 < check_call([pip, 'install', '-U', '--no-index', '-f', 'wheelhouse', < 'pip']) --- > > # TODO: feng > pip = 'pip' # this is a hack to use Python2 > check_call([pip, 'install', '-U', '--no-index', '-f', 'wheelhouse','pip']) 86,87c116 < check_call([pip, 'install', '-U', '--no-index', '-f', 'wheelhouse'] + < glob('wheelhouse/*')) --- > check_call([pip, 'install', '-U', '--no-index', '-f', 'wheelhouse'] + glob('wheelhouse/*')) 113c142,143 < sys.path.append('lib') --- > import os > sys.path.append(os.path.join(os.getcwd(),'lib')) 157c187,190 < cmd = ['apt-get', --- > me = platform.linux_distribution()[0] > if 'ubuntu' in me.lower(): > my_cmd = 'apt-get' > cmd = [my_cmd, 160a194,199 > elif 'cent' in me.lower(): > my_cmd = 'yum' > cmd = [my_cmd, > '--assumeyes', > 'install'] > execd.py A formatting error? 17a18 > from __future__ import print_function 114 ,115c115 < print ( \"ERROR ({}) running {}\" .format ( e.returncode, e.cmd ) , < file = stderr ) --- > print ( \"ERROR ({}) running {}\" .format ( e.returncode, e.cmd ) ,file = stderr ) How to build git clone http://hpcgitlab.labs.lenovo.com/WSS/wss.git .

Why? because I was thinking about this Chinese phrase, 寅吃卯粮, which means that one consumes savings meant for future use. The term bears a negative emotion that is used to criticize someone or some action that is irresponsible (in view of the present) and generally a bad idea. After all, shouldn't one only use what his means can cover? It is a conservative approach, and also sustainable. What's the equivalent in english? I thought of future value. Isn't it the same thing that we are mapping future values to current so we can benefit from, or consume, it right now. For all we know, forget about the future. It's uncertain and nobody knows how well those so called future values will be realized and how well they matching our estimation right now. The reason I was toying these terms was that I was thinking the root cause of wealth . I always thought that the only way to become rich is to take leverage. What is a leverage, borrowing money, use the resource that you don't own, and with less cost than the benefit you can get out of them. A convenient way is certainly to borrow from the someone, somewhere, and don't need to pay for it. It's free money, isn't it? Future seems to be a perfect candidate for this. Nobody has a crystal ball that actually works, but everyone has a lot of hope. And what is expectation? it is completly subjective, opinionated, and absolutely impossible to validate (until it becomes history). But doesn't the logic smell wrong? How can you get a free lunch without paying a price? and if it's not you who pays the price, then who will? I learned FV in MBA class. The math is simple enough and at the time I thought this is an artificial invention used only in finance to make yourself look smart, important and closer to the truth of wealth. But suddenly I had a thought — no, it is not a new concept, and it is not just in finance. It is everywhere. FV the consumer Stock price, bond price are all computed based on FV. Market adjusts their prices based on runtime guess of what the FV is like. Therefore it will fluctuate constantly. In its core it is consensus decision making where all market participants are casting a vote. The price is nothing but a form of FV. But finance ppl are crooks, you say. They invented these theories so to justify their irresponsible actions today. How can there be no harm done if to take what belongs to the future and use them now? Just take a look at social security, working class are paying for their parents' generation, and so hope their kids will pay theirs. This is a ponzi scheme in reality. So what is a counter example to this? How about manufacturing? They are solid ppl who make stuff, and making stuff creates value. You can NOT BS around making a solid bulk of physical stuff, a pile of steel that hums, works, and makes your life better. Well, let's see. You have a need to wash your clothes. When you buy a washing machine, you have taken the underline assumption that you will be using it not just once, but multiple times in the future. There is a life time by design, of course, and no one really keeps track of how many loads one does per week, and how many uses you will be doing in the next 5 years or before the machine is broken. But that's exactly how the price represents — one implicitly gives each load a price, multiplied over a time span and FV back to the present! This explains exactly why ppl cares about quality — because one doesn't know how many times she is going to use the washing machine, the longer it last, or the more loads you throw at it, the greater its FV should be, then discounted to PV, it should have a higher price. Now if you buy it lower than the PV in your mind, you feel it is a good deal — this, I call it the truth of the consumer threshold . FV the service The story doesn't end here. So after all, the logic of FV is correct? The financial gurus and manufacturer of consumer goods are all operating by the same principle. What about the present? We constantly hear the preach that happiness is about the present and one should live by the moment. Then how can one do that if one's consumer instinct is naturally about the future, about FV. Is there anything only valued at present? How about food? Food is consumed in the moment, right? There isn't a future value associated with it, or is there? Or any other service, a haircut, a smile from a cashier, grocery shopping... transactions are done then and now, you pay, you get your goods, done, period. We don't lump sum future services and discount them to a PV price, do we? or we actually do? When I sit in a restaurant ordered a dish, am I only paying for this round, this dish, or there is a share of the well being of this restaurant tomorrow, and next week? Certainly the profit is the media, or the hidden contract, between me as the consumer eating this dish, and the restaurant who does its share to be here and continue its service and maintain its quality. How well, or strong, should both parties support this bond? Doesn't this make those thin-margin, low-prices strategy a weaker contract or equally the same? and when we shop in those value stores, are we lowering our expectation, thus our FV, but still expecting the contractual promise hold true? Everybody understand you get what you pay for. Yet, we constantly struggle between a mismatched over-estimated FV (by our subjective will) and perception of a less qualified product/service. In math term and in common sense, this gap will never go away, and should never go away. If FV becomes a fixed value (think about planning economy where some God view determines a price, how ridiculous it is if you think of it in this context — consensus voting is the only way to discover and determine this value, therefore the market), how to fix the PV offered by service providers? and even more troublesome is that how do you know the consumer agrees with provider on each other's estimation? Taking the washing machine example, I am willing to put in $1 for a load, and wash weekly. So 10yr span will cost me $520. Anything more expansive than this is a ripoff, unless I decide to wash 2 loads per week now or the machine lasts more than 10 years. Turn the able around, if I manufacture washing machine, I want to know how many loads in avg a family of size-xyz (look up your country's demographics and household size) will do, and how much they are willing to pay per such use, then take the design life that I can deliver (again, in avg ), it's the price my consumers are willing to accept. The trick then, is how well I can discover these numbers comparing to how well my competitors are using these numbers. If my competitor builds a machine twice as durable as mine but sell at the same PV, should I panic? Obviously now with the context we have discussed, the key to answer this is not how durable his machine is, but how often consumer changes their machines ! — the design life time should last slightly longer than what customers are expecting to use it for, in theory. If it is too durable , it is an over design and is a waste. Therefore, a strategy to defeat my competitor at perception level, I want to show a machine that lasts twice as long as others' in the market — no one is to going to keep it that long, but the image matters. Marketing time Well, the scenario we discussed so far is implying that consumer will determine the end date of your discount period — averagely use a washing machine for 10 years. We know PV is heavily depending on the time length. Can we determine or control this time length then? Many variables come to play, disruptive technology, shift of consumer interest, fashion, some social change, new generation... this becomes a fuzzy war. So we need marketing, a voice in consumer's head that now you should ditch the old product and buy a new one. The more effective marketing is done, the more deterministic the replenish cycle can be. Therefore, marketing pushes the FV as much as possible, and controls the discount period as much as possible. In math it then becomes apparent the shorter the cycle the higher the PV. Therefore, if FV are similar, competitors have a diring need to shorten the cycle, and this I believe is the true root cause of product innovation → to the control the cycle. Interesting, isn't it? So back the our initial topic, I used to think FV is a fancy term that MBA uses to showoff his education. Now I realized FV and PV are everywhere. It is the only way to perceive this world, it is human nature. So again, I start to believe more and more that economy and finance are not about numbers, theories of money or currency or some conspiracy theory of political domination. It is about human nature, about what we really are. Extract the underline assumption, and you will see what these terms really mean.","tags":"thoughts","url":"https://fengxia41103.github.io/myblog/future%20value.html"},{"title":"Sync vs. Async","text":"Irrelevant Sync vs. Async. I have been thinking this to myself and have involved quite a few discussions with smart (and mostly young) developers which from time to time makes me wonder whether there is a definite answer for this at all. One thing I can fairly state is that there isn't a right or even an answer. It depends. Yes, it depends on what you mean by sync or async, and why you care about one way or the other. The discussion isn't technical, it isn't philosophical, it is to understand use case, user's expectation, workflow, execution sequence, business assumption, and maybe last, system performance. If the discussion isn't confined in these areas, it will go nowhere and quickly downgrade to a heated argument without a satisfaction from either parties involved but feelings hurt, self-opinion firmer believed in, and a mine field that no one is willing to step into again. Really, a particular framework or programming language does not make the design async or sync. Tornado , Twisted , or libs like Asyncio , Gevent , they all have the capability to help an async implementation if needed, but they don't make your design or your architecture async . Fundamentally one can even argue that computer architecture is genetically synchronous because CPU can execute one instruction at a time, unless multicore can be utilized, and I do mean they are utilized either by at the HW level where CPU, cache and memory are smart enough to take some instructions for parallel computing, or the higher level interpretation -- assembly, C, or sth even more abstract -- have the design and internal implementation all the way through to generate those instructions that make the CPU smart . Too many times ppl take multithreading and multiprocessing as the statement that my code or my design is now asynchronous, or event drive, or responsive, which all mean the same thing — it's superior to a synchronous one. Really? How do you validate all the components on your stack are implemented so support your statement? Is DB itself asyn capable (and what does this even mean!?)? is the DB interface lib asyn capable? is the 30+ imported libs, third-party tools, code you have written, asyn capable? Is the server lib based on Select , epoll ? Is your shell call using check_call ? Is your disk firmware async? Even step along the stack can bring your system to a halt regardless how some part of the stack is actually async. So my point here is async design or architecture is irrelevant because it is not a technical topic, but a business topic. Dependency Why so? Because what really matters is dependency . Your business workflow is the single voice that will dictate and define dependency. Use PM for example, if task A is depending on the completion of task B, then regardless how multitasking the resource assigned to these tasks are, tasks are executed in sequence, period, because that's what makes sense in business, even though it slows the entire system down. Technology can improve UX by making user's wait more tolerant, but it can not, and should not , remove the wait if it breaks business sense. Mapping this argument to an e-commerce app, if user needs to add to shopping cart, submit checkout, pay, get receipt — well, clicking that submit checkout button should BLOCK until it's accepted by server before he is presented with payment view — sync. What should really be done is sit down and watch this Tech talk , yes, technology is not a silver bullet unless you know what you want to get out of it. Now looking back to my career, funny the only real asyn requirement I have encountered is in china's workflow, the concept of 会签（consensus voting ← this is my phrase), but without a majority rule. Go figure. My implementation is to give everyone a high-five page and not bother to even post data back to the server — everything is handled on client side, no IO blocking concern of any kind, click-at-will and guaranteed consistent and satisfying responsive, realtime, event driven, taking advantage of any HW resource the user happens to have, distributed, HA, zero single point of failure....this, is an asynchronous design.","tags":"thoughts","url":"https://fengxia41103.github.io/myblog/sync%20async.html"},{"title":"父亲一家","text":"爷爷，奶奶，幸福邨，夏炽宇（九弟） 父亲叫爷爷\"大大\"，奶奶\"亲妈\" 上海人。老家在青浦朱家角。爷爷是地主，后来战乱到了上海，在上海华山路幸 福邨租了房子，地点离上海交大本部2站路。我父亲最小，上面都三个哥哥一个 姐姐，我分别介绍。他们叫他九弟，中间的几个夭折了。他长大的时候家里经济 应该很拮据，主要靠大哥的收入维持，所以他从那时候就养成了节俭的习惯，后 来经历建国来的那些年代，加上后来分配到了东北，那里虽然当时是中国的工业 基地，但生活条件与南方差距甚远，所以更是对自己的生活变得很苛刻。 幸福邨 父亲还记得自己以前的事情。他说起幸福邨的日子，说起住在那里的人，很多时 候还以为家还在那里。幸福邨是联排屋，我大学的时候家还在那里，整整的一栋 都是，三层，一大家子人都在，以前爷爷奶奶住在顶层，不大下来，我没有见过 奶奶，那天说起亲妈，我从来没有看见过他这么的激动，眼圈都红了。从没有见过父 亲哭，那次是最接近的一次。亲妈那个时候，也该是他现在这个年龄了吧。她是个 小脚女人，没有文化，但很会持家，她是我父亲心目中最尊敬的女性，没有之一。 幸福邨我见到的时候，又旧又挤，几家人合用一个厨房，厨房里面有一个浴缸， 晚上洗澡也在里面。这是真正的老上海，并不浪漫，也不温馨。地板是红色的， 很亮，有点儿滑，对在水泥房子里长大的我来说，那是个很奇怪的东西，直到有 了自己的家，一个1915年的老房子，才知道那样的地板是多么的酷。这就 是缺失的审美吧，只在上海这些被时代遗弃并最终被市容改造而推倒的破烂里还 留着些，少有人还愿意打理，只是住户现在拆迁的筹码，早和美没有了关系。 父亲最近常说起幸福邨，问这些人家都怎么安排。他总是担心要分家，怕分的不 公平。我说幸福邨已经拆迁了，大家都分了房子，他的，就在这里，1902，别人 家也都有了自己的，条件也比幸福邨好，这样他才安心。 大妈妈（大伯母） 父亲叫\"大嫂\" 大妈妈是个和蔼慈祥的老太太，见到的时候就是一头白发了。她个子小小的，说 话的时候眼睛总是有调皮的笑，好像暗藏玄机，就等着你说错了出丑。从没见过 她生气，没听过她抱怨。她是正房，大伯伯（后面会讲到）后来遇到了真爱，一 直不再回家，大妈妈从来没有说起过一次，总是挺开心的样子。我太小，无从了 解那时发生了什么，他们会是怎样的想法。现在多了世故，想到她的样子，真是 看不出一点儿的忧伤。只是记得有过一次，怎么谈话中说起大伯伯，好像是我父 亲带我去看他，她用了\"那个人\"。她记得的，只是不想提。大妈妈最早步入老年， 到了上海的养老院，父亲看过很多次，每次都说这个养老院好，也由此说到他觉 得养老院是个可以给小辈少添麻烦的地方，好，以后有像大妈妈这样好的也要去。 我说你这里就是大妈妈他们同一个养老院，在这里又开了新的，你不是喜欢大妈 妈的那个养老院吗，这个也是。 夏增敏（大姐姐） 上海话叫\"da3 jia1 jia1\"，父亲叫\"增敏\" 大姐姐和父亲很亲，像兄妹。我父亲因为家里最小，所以我的辈分很高。大姐姐 虽然是我的堂姐，但她的女儿比我大两岁。大姐姐很幽默，早年姐夫过世，她就 一个人带着一个女儿，住在幸福邨一楼和二楼中间的一个小房间里。女儿李洁后 来来了美国，她也就来了这里。听父亲说，大姐姐小时候很喜欢逗我哥，常把他 弄哭，然后再哄他，这像她，她的性格是活泼顽皮的，脑子非常的快，父亲总是 很照顾她们家，她也很了解他的性格脾气，两人在一起总是很多的说笑，父亲如 果见到她，会是开心的。她的房间总是很干净，穿着也是那么的大方，女儿更是 在那个时候第一次让我见识到了上海女孩儿的打扮。如果现在想起来，一个词， 品味。 夏赠域（大哥哥） 父亲叫\"增yo4\",\"da3 guo1 guo1\" 大哥哥住在二楼。他的房间最大，可能是因为是长孙吧，分到的大，也最新。家 里很漂亮，电器也是最多的。女儿夏炯璐（上海叫\"jun jun\"）后来也来了美国， 来的时候我还去帮她找房子，参加毕业典礼，后来毕业后她结婚就没什么联系。 大哥哥现在应该多数时间在她家里。 大嫂据说年轻时候很漂亮，女儿是公主一样。大学时去幸福邨，他们也是自己 做自己吃，大家虽然同处一层，但来往不多。大哥哥人很好，话不多，和父亲挺 谈得来，改革之初在一个合资厂工作，那时候应该日子也不错。 南京，南工 父亲大学上了南京工学院，那个时候还叫中央大学，多么大气的名字， 后来改名叫东南大学，父亲总说太小家子，没了原来的神气。南京，就这 样成了他最爱的地方。这次坐车南下，路过南京，我说你看南京了，他转过来看窗外， 脸上有了表情，像以前的他一样，满是神采。故里，记忆，这就是一个地名对一个 人一生的不忘。 父亲最得意的时候，一定是他在大学里当足球队长。他床头有一张照片，两 排帅气的小伙子，都是长袖的T shirt，短裤，只有他站在后排的左边， 穿着西装，个子却又不高。是以前的人的风范么，那时的人穿西装，真是意气风发的青年，那种 青春的光彩照人，那么的意气风发，那么的充满朝气。他最津津乐道的是一场代 表学校和南京市队的比赛，他是队长，打后卫，他特地的定了战术，而且得以 实施，他每每说起都是笑，那时的他，还有他的那些大学的同学、队友，都是那 么的年轻，那么的充满未来和希望，那么的在大时代中等待着一番作为。 南京是他熟悉的地方，每次必去的是中山陵，灵谷寺，明孝陵。父亲喜欢走路。 和他出游对小孩子是不快乐的，从中山陵到灵谷寺再到哪儿哪儿，都是在走路， 路边记得是很多的竹林，很漂亮，但孩子的心里只记得了几个地名，还有走不完 的路，还得附和着他兴致勃勃的讲解，要听那些历史的故事，回去好写作文，心 里惦记的i只是什么时候能遇到一个卖冰棍儿的老太太，可以买了坐下，解解南 京的酷暑，现在，只记得了竹林，满眼的绿色，中山陵前面的台阶，一个挺威严 的孙中山的雕像，还有他带着的走不完的路。这就是他的南京，都还在，哪天再 走到这些地方，他说的故事，也都还在， 他的神采，也还会在。 东北电力设计院，烧菜，他的古典音乐 大学毕业分配到了东北电力设计院，那时的东北是好地方，中国最发达的工业基 地，在这儿，他也遇见了我母亲，也有了我们家。东北院当年是辉煌的，主楼三 个对着街的大门，前面是长春最宽的马路，斯大林大街。楼里面地面都是大理石， 还有大理石的楼梯扶手，从二楼到一楼大厅的是小孩子最喜欢的滑梯。院里有幼 儿园，子弟校，医务室，住也都在一起，叔叔阿姨都认识，来办公室找他就像回 家，上班下班都一起走，这种感觉现代人体会不到。 父亲一辈子在东北院，专业是输煤，这是个挺偏的学问，到退休了后继无人，倒 成就了他到处飞，给国家咨询公司审核项目。输煤组属于机务室，母亲的化学水 处理也是，两个人上班在同一个楼层，房间离的也不远。这样的安排，现代人得 是多么的羡慕。父亲的专业能力应该很强，后来当了技术处的处长。但最得意的 是做的一手好菜，上海人的缘故吧，知道很多东西怎么吃，单位同事聚会，总是 在我们家。也是第一次喝了一口茅台，呛得半死，只有后来在加州第一次吃 wasabi是这样的，心跳的快休克，从此对白酒没了一点儿好感。父亲最得意的东 西是他的面筋，现在不稀奇了，那个时候除了自己做，别无来源，而作面筋是个 及其费功夫的事儿，但真是好吃。他除了面筋，还把洗出来的面晾干，作灌肠， 那也是我吃过的最好的灌肠，北京找了这么多年，从来没有了。 同事最乐道的是他不怕冷，一是他年轻身体好，二是南方的冬天比北方更难熬， 所以他并怕。这个习惯一直到今天，他怕热不怕冷，冬天穿的很少，从来不带帽 子手套围巾，我们都捂成了粽子，他还是单衣，光着两只手，他也总是在忙碌在 作事情，所以可能也真是不冷。单位里的事他从来没说起太多，年轻人好像都喜 欢他，他替他们着想，帮他们出主意，鼓励他们出去闯荡，看世界。后来有了我 哥，名声在外，如何教育也是他常被请去的话题。 他做事十分的严谨，看他的字就知道，工工整整，没有电脑的年代，他自己就是 个机器人一样，横平竖直，哥哥可能就像他，所以很受器中，我不行，写字总带 着自己的臆想，在框框里往外飞，现在更是没了半点儿他的味道。父亲最钟爱的 书是《傅雷家书》，从大学起给我们写信，直到近些年不写了，大学以后已经听 不进去他的话，信都留着，按时间顺序排列整齐，等着给他个惊喜，他应该没想 到，不靠谱的我也会有他的印记。 父亲并不交际，来往的也就几个。他收集了上千盘的磁带，都是古典音乐，在那 个年代，这是宝贝，他用上了他的印刷体的字，每一个都标注清楚，连曲目，多 少分钟都不差，然后说起来津津乐道，那可真是他的宝贝。家里专门做了一个柜 子，收集这他的珍藏。科技的进步让这些都成了过时货，磁带在苏州的潮湿里八 成也发了霉。多放些古典的曲目给他听，问他喜欢吗，他会说，喜欢。是的，年 轻的时候是听不得古典音乐的，现在，看着他，听着这些，心会静，他即使不说 话，也是在听吧，也还听的到，听见过去的自己。 自行车，夏炽邦（大伯伯） 上海话伯伯叫\"爸爸\"，父亲叫他大哥 我对大伯伯印象很少，见到他的时候已经是我大学了。那时的他就是个瘦瘦的小 老头，身材像我父亲现在，但很精神。听我父亲说，他年轻的时候很是帅气和英 俊，而且因为早早就在外面做事，在小的弟弟眼里，有很多让人羡慕的东西。父 亲常提起的是大伯伯的一辆自行车，Raleigh,是英国的老牌子，听说是二战时英 国兵的用车，所以这样的战用物资在当地人眼里也是好东西。牌子的标记是一只 凤头，上海人说起来凤头自行车，指的就是它。也正是因为这个，建国后才有了 上海的凤凰自行车，仿照的Raleigh。这就是老上海人的\"情怀\"，其实都是当时 生活中的一部分，并没有谁刻意，水到渠成了上海人的品味和见识。 这辆车应该给我父亲留下了很深的音像，所以我们家我最早记得的两辆自行车， 一辆蓝色的26自行车就是凤凰,父母结婚的见证，而且父亲自己会动手修车，洗 车，小时候有过一次演示给我怎么把轮子都拆开，把滚珠都一粒粒的拿出来，然 后上润滑油，一种像膏一样的、半透明的东西，我记得摸了一下，不喜欢，味 道也是一股油味，不喜欢，用手在土里蹭，结果沾了很多的土，油却还是在。。 小孩子没有耐心，他很津津乐道的讲给我听，也是他很得意的手艺，我后来就失 去了兴趣，至今都没有学会，每每遇到自己的自行车有了问题，真是想拿起电话 来找他。美国的自行车店里修车的架子，工具一应俱全，看了总是想起他，他如 果有这些工具，该是多开心。 大伯伯一直抽烟喝酒，父亲说他舞跳的很好。见到他的时候他还是老上海人的样 子，头发梳得很整齐，油油的向后背着，穿一双锃亮的三接头皮鞋，真是有风度。 笑起来就是夏家的人，眼睛眯眯的。他很风趣，说话时眼睛列很多的神采，虽然 那个时候的我和他也不熟悉，听不太懂他在说什么，但看神情能知道他以前是个很 活跃的人。想想在上海他要挣钱养家，又会跳舞，会有多少故事。 大伯伯应该以前对我父亲照顾很多，是不是他上大学的钱也是大伯伯资助的，他 好像提过，我不记得了。应该是受了大伯伯的影响，我父亲对上海当年流行过的国外货 情有独钟，家里有一只美国的军用水壶，下面套了一个可以拿下来当饭盒，然后 有一个金属的扣，一扣就合在了一起，那是我小时候运动会时必带的装备，我父 亲一直告诉我那是个好东西，在我眼里，我更羡慕别的小朋友的绿色的军用水壶， 现在想来，是不是撒。 苏州，姑姑（亲伯/爸），我们家 父亲叫她\"阿 jia1\"，上海话\"阿姐\" 姑姑住在苏州，这也开始了我们家和苏州的缘分， 直到现在我们家也在苏州落了脚，父亲以前也常和我讨论以后养老的地方，说苏 州是他想在的地方。他喜欢苏州的面，小笼包，新鲜的小河虾，青菜，不大的城 市，离上海不远，却又不在其中，可以走路，可以骑车，并且，还有姑姑在时的 地方，都还能认得，都还能见到。 亲爸是个好人，是我们家族里所有人都公认的好人。家里重男轻女，她没怎么上 学就开始帮家里作事情。姑父是作什么的我都不知道，我印象里的他已经行动不 便，经常在床上，戴一个很厚很厚的眼睛。他说话挺有趣的，对我很好，教会 了我下中国象棋，虽然小孩子耐心甚少，应该下了一会儿就没了兴趣。 姑姑的婚姻应该并不是她所想的,重男轻女的年代，家里的女儿除了嫁人养家， 没有其他的安排和出路。这个是后来听父亲说的。姑姑在苏州园林局工 作，地点就在玄妙观的旁边，现在是个文昌殿了，以前小时候我还常去找她，也 经常在玄妙观里玩。她那里有很多小乌龟什么的，我总是想要拿一个回来，记得 有一次真的给我买了一个，我捧在手里，好小好小的一只，记得就让它在我手里 爬，它爬到边上了，赶紧用另一只手接过去，就让它这么爬，感觉好神奇，有一 个比自己还小的生物，可以动，感觉都可以和它交流说话，自己懂得它想要什么。 我小时候在苏州出生，长大到小学一年级，就住在姑姑家，一个苏州的院落，里 面几家的住户，有一口井。我后来养了两只小乌龟，就放养在院子里。夏天大家 在院子里乘凉，井上盖了一个脸盆，有时候就听 砰噔 一声，就是我的乌龟爬到 井边，结果掉到了脸盆里。姑姑的收入不高，两个女儿，我们叫大姐、小姐，因 为从小在那儿长大，走在苏州的巷子，白墙黑瓦，就觉得像是家,也总吃不厌苏 州的面，总在寻找记忆里的味道，但找不到了经常。 母亲生下哥哥后得了一场大病，差点就没了。东北的生活条件太差，妈妈就到了 苏州来养病，并且，我父亲总是认为上海的医学水平才是最高的，这就是他的上 海情节吧。后来有了我，就又来到苏州，把我生下后寄养在了苏州，就这样成了 一个苏州人，一直到小学一年级结束回到长春。他们说我那时会讲一口的苏州话， 不记得了。但大学来上海，第一天打开收音机，听上海的滑稽戏，我就乐的不行， 其他的外地同学还要刻苦学习上海话，像学英语一样，都还是听不懂，这我一直 以为就是小时候的记忆还在。那时小，记得的不多了，记得那个院子，记得水池 旁边的鼻涕虫，记得两只小乌龟下雨的时候会出来吃东西，记得地砖上的青苔， 好像常年都在，记得听过一次评弹，记得晒衣服的竹竿，不记得了他们说的一个 带我的奶奶，奶奶说过来你眼神好给我的针穿个线，小孩子不容易逮住，那就一 次多穿几根，然后等她回来，我说穿好了，给她一根线上穿了10根针，小孩子的 耳朵，真是长到了哪里！亲爸对我就像是我的母亲，我只记得她对我很好，还有 后来父亲经常讲起来她怎么宠我，说我坐在蚊帐里，她把吃的东西递到蚊帐里给 我，我妈妈来看我时候看到了，说我被宠坏了。 亲爸一直养花，我记得院子里有好多的花，还有蚕树，我小时候养过蚕，看到他 们结茧，但没想到最后变出来一个褐色的蛾子，这对我的心灵冲击不小，因为蛾 子在我的脑子里可不好玩，手摸了会有粉，那时候被告知这个粉不能吃，吃了会 变成哑巴，所以蛾子对我是个挺恐怖的东西。亲爸养的花特别的好，我不认识花， 有时候会闻到花香，觉得好熟悉，那真是人深层的记忆，都说不出是什么花香， 但知道自己闻过，好熟悉的味道，像家，像过去，像不记得却又不忘记的曾经。 就这样，苏州也成了我们家最亲近的地方，亲爸在我大学的时候，92还是93年因 为肝癌过世了。虽然那时也不懂得死亡是什么，都不知道应不应该悲伤，觉得自 己好没有良心。但上海一家人一起坐火车到苏州站的时候，看见苏州两个字，真 的知道了悲伤原来是这样的感觉，失去，如同后来经历过的各种失去一样，好让 人难过，又怎能不哭呢？最后一次去看姑姑，我都不记得了她的情况，小姐（我 的表姐，下面会讲到）送我到门口，我转身给她100块钱，说本来是我想工作以 后把第一个月的工资给亲爸的，但怕来得及了。那个时刻还不知道就会分别，只 是预感吧，也是自己把心里想要做的事情、要说的话说了，自己心里会好受些。 但就是这样的，由于彼此那么的熟悉，由于彼此那么的在意，预感就是真实的， 是最终会应验的。这样的预感后来还有过一次，是和我哥。 两个苏州的姐姐 -- 大姐，小姐 父亲叫她们全名的时候多，有时候也叫小名芸芸，铃铃 姑姑有两个女儿，我们叫大姐（胡德芸）、小姐（胡德玲）。小时候在苏州，总 是小姐管着我，所以我印象里的小姐挺厉害的。小姐后来工作就接了姑姑的班， 也在园林局工作，后来是会计，在北寺塔，每次回国到苏州，我都会去北寺 塔找她，一说她的名字就可以进去，给她个惊喜。父亲常说两个姐姐继承了姑姑 的风范，非常的热情热心，也很靠得住，所以他们退休后就从长春落脚到了苏州。 那个时候我和哥哥已经都出国，所以他们这个举动也是为今后的养老作了安排， 两个姐姐就像女儿一样。 大姐小姐性格很不一样，因为比我大很多，所以我了解的并不多。大姐大大咧咧 的，说话声音也大，做事很快，雷厉风行，总让我觉得吵架得找她，她一出马就 一定可以了。小姐话少些，行事应该更细心，事情考虑的很周到，姐夫后来当了 苏州观前街改造的负责人，生活也就此变得很好。我们家也借着这个关系在观前 街改造的回迁房里买了一套。姑姑原来的院子在街南，叫碧凤坊，已经没了踪影， 记得小时候每次台风过后，走在观前街上，都是倒下的树，然后去新华书店买铅 笔，课本，还有两分的冰棍儿。现在也住的不远，父母都很喜欢，离从前的 记忆也不远，还是可以走路到观前街，那个新华书店也还在。 夏炽国（二伯伯），二妈妈，大咪，小咪，出国 二妈妈是二伯母，父亲叫\"二嫂\" 二伯伯我没有印象，因为他文化大革命的时候就自杀了。他们家和我们这个家族 都离的很远，直到我的哥哥上大学。二伯伯年轻时候的一个同学，家境很好，父 亲是做地产生意的，后来去了香港，家里最小的一个女儿留在了上海，就是二妈 妈。 二妈妈是我见过的最富有的上海小姐了。我们家只是小康，听说爷爷开过一个 \"常德榨油厂\",后来还有一个饼干厂，日子虽然也好过过一阵，但后来都破败了， 个中原因我也不知道。二妈妈家可不一样，满屋子的红木家居，一直请着一个保 姆，地板要打蜡，一个人住着这么大的房子，非常的不一样。二妈妈很多见识， 两个女儿，我们叫大咪姐姐、小咪姐姐，都非常的漂亮也很出众，两个都是学的 医，在我的印象里非常的优雅得体，那真是大家闺秀。我和她们接触的很少，小 咪姐姐是我哥哥的年纪，大咪姐姐我第一次有印象，已经是她准备去美国定居之 前了，都不知道说什么，也不知道该怎么站怎么坐，就觉得不是一个世界里的人， 有些尴尬。 二妈妈后来当了中学里的生物学老师。她父亲应该留了足够的财产给她，她工作 一是自己想要做事，二是后来文化大革命抄了家，有可用的钱也不能用，怕惹麻 烦。但总是有香港的哥哥在，所以生活上是比平常人家好很多的。因为这些经历， 二妈妈一直就要孩子出国，父亲也因此影响吧，在我很早的时候就知道我未来要 走出国这条路。后来小咪姐姐先嫁了人去了美国，然后大咪姐姐也是，哥哥上了 复旦物理系，大学毕业后虽然分配到吉林工业大学工作，但那是龙游潜池，大家 都知道他不会在那里很久的，一定是出国。那时的出国只有一个办法，拿全额的 奖学金，这对他并不难，我能出去倒真是个奇迹。91年南方发大水，交大 的军训都缩短到了1个月，而且是在校，排了通宵的队买到去北京的火车票 送他，其实那一刻也就决定了我之后也必然 是这样的路。所以，我们家的出国梦始于二妈妈。 二妈妈知道很多教育的理念，做人的道理，上大学的时候我常去她家，在陕西南 路，那时的陕西南路并不觉得复古，和其他的上海的街道一样，我们家的华山路 也很漂亮，很多大的洋房，都带花园。小咪姐姐的婚礼就在丁香花园，让我很早 就知道丁香花园是个好地方，边上有一个面包房，每次走过都是bakery的香， 香。我哥哥总是用这个气我，因为我年龄太小，等我到大学的时候，这些表姐 堂姐们都已经成家，我一个婚礼都没有赶上，第一次吃宴席，是我姑姑的葬礼之 后，感觉很别扭，那时的大学生，又是很饿，又觉得场合不对怎么可以大吃。二 妈妈烧菜很好吃，每次我去她都很开心，一定烧好多的菜，自己吃的不多，最后 都是我消灭，很大的满足感。有时候还在家里住一晚，家里单独有房间给我，大 大的电视，沙发，床，床头还有音响，那真是都让人无所适从，幸福来的太快。 二妈妈家一直有佣人，帮着打扫和洗菜，但二妈妈不让她烧，这在我也是第一次， 然后吃饭也不在一个桌子上，第一次分了等级，即陌生又很尴尬，觉得这样不对 或是不好，也不懂为什么会有这样的规矩。一次那个老妈妈掏出一个纸条，她儿 子的电话，让我帮她拨电话给他，很高兴可以为她做些事情，觉得举手之劳，可 以让老人家这么开心，多好， 因为二妈妈家庭的背景吧，二伯伯文化大革命受了冲击，自己最后结束了生命。 后来二妈妈也要带学生下乡，就留了两个女儿在上海，常听她说起这段经历，每 次都恨那个年代，恨造成这个年代的人。那时候觉得她好大的愤怒，自己也不懂， 觉得为什么要那么的恨，现在开始明白了，只是人那个时候还没有受过伤，不知道伤的感觉， 不知道心里的伤，如果没有机缘的照顾，就没有机会愈合，会陪一辈子，难过一 辈子。就这样，这个家庭，既是富足得让人羡慕的，又是这么大的悲伤。 大咪姐姐，姐夫，我们家的红楼梦 大咪姐姐嫁了二妈妈的学生。他应该是个很活跃的人，我第一次见到他的时候在 上海锦江饭店，第二次在锦仓文华，人生中第一次，大餐，大世面。他那个时候 已经在美国作生意，很富有，回上海不住在家里，当时的锦江饭店，锦仓文华， 全上海最贵的地方，记得一层靠街的一排有一些小店，卖衣服服饰的，好漂亮， 路过都不敢往里面看，因为里面的女服务员们也都穿的很精致，漂漂亮亮的，这 在男大学生眼里，是不敢直视的女人的魅力。 那次去是二妈妈带着，姐夫请家里人吃饭，一桌10个人，他的父母，二妈妈和我， 还有几个上年纪的我都不认识。吃的什么都不记得了，有一个不会忘， 每个人 有一份鲍鱼，第一，从来没有吃过会单独有一份东西是给你的饭；二，二妈妈把 她的给了我，说这个好吃，我平时也吃不到，让我尝尝。真是暴殄天物，大学生 除了饿就是饿，真是没有一点点的印象，就觉得是一块没有骨头的肉，吃了两块 儿怎么能够呢？那次的饭现在都不记得了，就记得最后账单二妈妈专门拿给我看， 1000块人民币。我一个月的生活费是100，在同学里都是中上有余了，1000，真 都不知道那是多少钱，好多钱吧。 姐夫做什么生意的不知道，就知道后来很发达，第一次见到大咪姐姐是她准备去 美国定居，坐头等舱，对于只做过火车的我来说，没有概念。大咪姐姐穿的很漂 亮，大儿子小欣父亲常说非常有礼貌，家教很严，父亲去做客，把吃的东西放在 桌上，小家伙5岁，会马上拿起来扔到垃圾桶，说不可以随便放，妈妈要说的。 二儿子小杰可能太小了，完全没有印象，就是个baby吧。 后来97年研究生毕业，带父母去了一次Washington DC 大咪姐姐家，那真是，唯一的一次开车需要从门口的大门一直开到房子的入口， 一个圆形的转盘，像香港的电影一样，真正的million dollar house。那时候的 大咪姐姐的家是多么的让人羡慕。有一次周末从二妈妈家回学校，正巧姐夫的公 司的人在家里，二妈妈让他送我回去，一辆Lexus，一直开到本部番隅路的校门， 然后开到了校园里，应该很拉风吧，但自己只是坐立不安，迈出车子的时候好想 隐身。这就是第一次接触到了有钱人，接触到了一个不知道的世界，觉得和自己 的生活没有交集。 后来姐夫的生意出了问题，很多家里的事情也只是听父亲说起，知道大咪姐姐很 不容易，二妈妈也一直和他们生活。小欣从小很帅气，像美国的ABC，后来上了 Harvard B school。小杰上了Stanfor的数学系，第一个学期在Wall street internet，据说就是年薪20万， 让人感觉家庭的传承是多么的牢固，虽然一代人起起落落， 最终家庭的教育、见识，还会再次起步，小欣来HBS的时候姐姐、姐夫都来送他，在 Boston得以一聚，很难得。觉得自己家的发展能有今天，二妈妈是所有的原点。谢谢她。 每每说起大咪姐姐一家的事情，就想起红楼梦， 小咪姐姐 小咪姐姐很漂亮，姐夫家有海外关系，所以她是最早出国的，也开始了夏家的出 国运动。她和我哥哥年纪相仿，据说很谈的来。见到她的时候已是97年带我父母 去看二妈妈的时候了，自己开了牙医诊所，后来的生活非常的富足。一个女儿，Angela, 地地道道的ABC，印象里的她也就婷婷的大小，10岁左右。哥哥的事情的时候， 不知道什么原因，小咪姐姐没有来。这在父亲那里一直不能释怀，也影响给了我。 三伯伯（夏炽球），萍萍姐姐，新加坡 父亲叫他\"七哥\" 三伯伯最像我父亲，笑起来一模一样，据说脾气也是一样，特别的犟，但父亲总 说七哥的性格最好，从来不着急也不发火，但命运对他不公平。三伯伯喜欢艺术， 家里有字画，认识很多这样的朋友，像最早春晚里演哑剧的严顺开，还有演济公 的游本昌。最早见到的时候给我看他的邮票，后来给我看他收集的字，听父亲说， 他的字写的家里最漂亮，按现在的说法就是个文艺青年。父亲每每说起三伯伯都 怀着一种感激，说他为夏家做了很多，尤其我母亲生病的时候，帮了我们很多的 忙。但受到的待遇是不公平的。三伯伯的女儿，萍萍姐姐，后来嫁到了新加坡。 高考的时候她来长春补习，住在家里，那时我还小，所以这样两家走的很近，大 学的时候也常去他们家。只记得三妈妈（三伯母）总拉着我说家长里短，我听不 太懂，也不知道该有什么态度和意见，她叫我\"五锋\"（上海话离的夏读\"五\"）， 也让我觉得有些奇怪，不知道怎么应对。她是个好人，97年的冬天回国，正巧赶 上了她落葬，第一次听那么多人说起她来，都说她这样的好那样的好，我印象里 最像上海小女人的人，就是她了。 伯母走后，三伯伯后来也搬来了苏州，住的离家里很近，和我父亲一起去同里、 周庄、朱家角，那个时候的父亲是快乐的，看照片列他俩很开心。三伯伯依然每 次见到，都说的最多的是他的花园，他弄的这样的那样的小玩意儿，多是自己的 手工制作，用些邻居不要的废旧的东西，然后说的满脸的得意，很有成就感。屋 子里东西不多，很简朴，但总是有些字画、盆景、小工艺品，突然一下拉我过去 说来给你看这个，满脸的孩子气的炫耀给我看，想想好可爱。父亲现在还常问起 七哥，问他还回不回来。三伯伯16年去了新加坡，不会回来了，据说父亲的状况 第一次让大家意识到，也是送三伯伯走的时候。兄弟情深，但总是得离别。 母亲张迈毅 我母亲，北京人。两人同在东北电力设计院工作工作了一辈子，也在长春生活了 一辈子。母亲很能干，今年也80了，不服老，性格很强，能力强的人性格都强， 很多想法，这也像我，让我害怕老了会像她，那我还是不要等到那会儿的好。她 和父亲以前很好，我一直这么认为，但我们都走了他俩开始各种生活上的不合拍， 父亲节俭夏天也不肯开空调，母亲不肯，她调到26度，父亲调到28度，就是这样， 互相消耗这时光和记忆。他俩性格都很犟，不肯妥协，两个都说不通，后来我也 不说了，各自怎么生活都行，只要自己开心就好了。 母亲北京人，几个兄弟都在北京，也不习惯苏州的天气，夏天太热，冬天太冷， 所以两个人一半一半，冬天在北京过春节，春天回苏州，然后夏天可能又回北京， 然后秋天再来苏州。以后没这样的机会了，父亲喜欢南方，我问他如果你最后自 己不能动了，你会选择北京还是上海还是苏州，他说那还是苏州好。现在就在上 海、苏州的中间，有乡音，有家乡的菜，有各种上海周边的人的青浦话，松江话， 这样的那样的话，离他的同学，他的同事，他的从前最近，我想，他知道的话是 会高兴的。 母亲对生活很多的理念，很能干，织毛衣，各种的花样的设计，自己动手，那时 的家其乐融融，哥哥出了国，我也在大学等着出国，前途似锦，一片光明。那时 的她也是骄傲的，两个这么好的儿子，这么好的未来的生活。日子一直都不差， 她有一个不停息的心，和时代同步，学电脑，学手机，学微信，但这也让她和父 亲的距离越来越远，父亲弄不来h这些东西，他也想，但不愿意被母亲说着去做， 后来就索性不做了。现在的两个人，不知道。父亲还常问起她，说不要和她分开。 停不住的是时间，能在一起的时候不开心，那上帝发的下 一张牌，可能就是，要分开了。 夏雷（哥）,田文彤（嫂子），婷婷(Nicole) 我哥65年5月6日，属蛇，大我8岁。他是父亲最喜欢，最器中，最觉得得意的作 品。他从小学习极好，又很不受u传统那些条条框框的束缚，老师一方面恨的不 行，一方面实在喜欢他的才气。我没赶上他的各种粉丝女暗恋者，但即使到了最 后，不说也能感觉到那个谁谁，当初一定是爱他的一个人。他名气太大，在院里 谁都知道夏雷，我考到省实验的第一天，班主任叫我到门口，给另一个老师指着 说，这是夏雷的弟弟。就是这样，高中的三年我的身份，惭愧。现在想想，是不 是当成功的人的家人都是这样的，妻子丈夫人前显贵，另一个确如何实现和认知 自己呢？只有无知无畏的二代们才愿意生活在父辈的影子里，没了自我还很开心。 他考到复旦，我考到交大。他出国，我也出国，他的脚印就是我的必经之路。高 中时怕他像怕神，父母出差都不在，晚自习愁了一晚上，考试成绩不好，要回去 交代，今天就是他跟我，完蛋了。旁边的同学说你怎么这么怕你哥啊，我说我觉 得只有离家出走或是一死了之两个办法了。但要面对的总要面对，那是一个漫长 的夜晚，现在说娃娃的时候，常让我想起他，而我就是现在的娃娃，真是让人着 急。被他说的倒是开了窍，知道了怎么总结归纳自己考试中的错误。这个成了我 以后安身立命的习惯，从高考到考TOEFL考GRE，到现在自己的工作，无处不在。 敏而好学，他十几岁就悟出来了，我到三十几才明白，这就是差距。 他学了物理系，从来对文科生嗤之以鼻，这绝对的影响了我对 文科、文艺、文学、艺术、绘画、诗歌、各种综艺的接受程度，很低。他也和父 亲一样喜欢古典音乐，以后的理想是吹saxphone。他身上有优越感，但对我，就 是个哥哥，有他在的时候，我觉得自己英文都不会说，也不用说，总是他会去问 路，会和别人交谈。他走了，真的感觉自己就长大了，得担责任，得照顾爸妈， 得管好自己。在ICU看到他的时候，他已经不能说话了，上了呼吸机，好心的印 度护士告诉我，前几天有个病人也是上了呼吸机，后来就好了，就拆了呼吸机然 后人慢慢康复了。现在回头看，才知道那只是对我们的安慰吧。我说\"哥，我来 了\"，拉着他的手，他用指甲狠狠压了一下。我说我知道，我会照顾婷婷，会照 顾爸妈。多么无力的承诺啊，婷婷自己就长大了，嫂子照顾的很好，她也很好.爸 妈现在老了，会的，哥，你不在没事儿，我在。 父亲在苏州真山买了墓地，夏家的一排，自己的，还有哥的，都在一起。哥的骨 灰分成两份，一份在苏州陪爸妈，一份在我身边。每次去看他，如果就我一个人， 都给他听听我的音乐，给他看看现代的科技，他没见过，但如果他在，我知道他 会怎么说。他那么聪明的人，一定也是很多的观点，很多的嗤之以鼻，很多的幽 默。父亲昨天又问起了哥，问他住在哪儿。如果失忆也可以让人忘记那些忧伤的 事，那它也好，让他觉得哥哥还在，还在生活，还让人担心，让人惦记，和他说 夏雷挺好的，婷婷也挺好的，过些天来看你，他会安心。 (to be

air, eating a spicy food, watching people coming in and out, full of life, full of noise, full of hope. Yet, I kept wondering that everybody here has one type of headache or another in their lives, just the same. But how ignorant we are of each other. We judge people's mind from such a shallow observation, yet have no mean nor much interest in knowing what they really are. The only thing we know is that they must have something that bother them, make them sad, make them happy, make them mad, make them forget the life troubles for a moment, and make them fall into a sinking feeling late at night that they felt giving it up. That's how I felt. The two weeks have been a tough time. I knew it's coming. Mentally it's such a sure thing that I felt watching a train approaching a station, however slow it may be, it is coming, and there is no other way out but to deal with it. Facing reality is difficult, not only of his deterioating health, which is rather natural and inevitable, but to realize what is lost is loss, and there is no turning back the clock. All the old memories flushed through my brain and choked me without mercy. There it is, there they are, look at them, yes, look at them, because regardless whether you are looking at it or not, it is staring at you in the face, and that's the reality. How sad. I felt I wasn't going to make it. Where to begin? and where to end? I lost it in this storm without the slightest understanding of what went wrong and why it happened so quickly, so thoroughly, and so painfully. It's hard. This is really hard. I could only tell myself to keep pedaling, keep head above the water, keep breathing, keep the old routine as a string attached to the life I know and I like, to keep it sane. Such a lonely fight. Not that I'm afraid of taking it on. There is nothing to be afraid of, what will come will come, what will leave will leave. I followed my instinct, my experience of the best I-know-how, and I know I can survive even it's a lost battle. Yet, the process is too hard. I can understand now people in depression will take their lives just like that. It's easier, really. Not that there is not hope, but the path to get there, to get even closer to that hope, is hard, too hard to bear, too hard to imagine, too hard to recall, too hard to be forgotten.","tags":"thoughts","url":"https://fengxia41103.github.io/myblog/what%20a%20day.html"},{"title":"Nursing home evaluation","text":"Due to Dad's deterioating condition, nursing home becomes a necessary option that we must consider as a way to handle this situation. The following are notes most based on recollection and first impression so that they are likely biased and are certainly opinionated. Sites visited: 北京金手杖: recommended by my college group and by a highschool friend. Either the marketing was well done or the word-of-mouth was quite successful. 苏州怡养园: recommended by 大姐、小姐 and our neighbour. It's meant to be the best option in Suzhou. 上海泰康申园: recommended by a BJ friend. The facility also has locations in BJ and Guangzhou. Well known for its patients such as 前外交部长吴 仪. It was also mentioned that enrolled patients can move from location to location free of charge. 上海凯健国际Cascade Health: invested by Cascade from the States. Looks great on paper. Highend service. Basic model All sites run with the same model by having two offerings: independent living 自理 and dependent care 护理. Independent care rents a room with one or two beds. Helper is extra and completly depending on client's preference. You can either hire theirs or bring your own. Costs include rent, helper, food, utility. Dependent care charge per bed. Helper is mandatory and is depending on the severity of client's condition. Costs include rent, helper, and food. Overall expanse is roughly 50% more expansive than the one of independent care. There are community rooms of various kind and group activities such as singing, dancing, movie, interest group and such. Basic services usually include laundry, room cleaning, hair cut, physical therapy, nutrition consulting. Quality however varies.

People in BJ site are rather young. So it feels more like a group living that these people are seeking fun being together. Since helper service is not mandatory it is more of a rental service with basic house cleaning, community living, 一日三餐 ready, and accessibility to medical service and additional help when needed. Helpers are nearly all 农村妇女 with likely low education level since the expectation is room service instead of personal/medical service. They usually charge a basic fee regardless whether you hire their helpers or not. Utility is charged per room. One can cook, and some even allow unregistered family members living there so a room can accommodate more than the patient. 上海泰康 charge per head instead of room.

They all have such patients. Only 上海泰康 is actively pursing assisting methods to battle deterioating situation; all others are merely accommodating with challenges of basic living and no more. Since these patients are at mercy of these care takers, I think it becomes crucial to evaluate their attitude towards the disease, the effect on the patient and people around him, and the approach they are to take to help the situation. 北京金手杖 Facility is nearly identical to its independent care section except an added nurse frontdesk on each floor. However the woman doctor disappaered during my short visit and the desk was unattended. Even though there is medical cabinet in the back room, I felt the room was strangely uncluttered so I suspect the room doesn't have much supply, therefore the service it can provide will also be limited. I did not see any patient with Dad's symptom. They may be taken for walk, or the patient they have are 卧床 type instead of Dad's situation. Either way, helpers are midage country women who unlikely received much training. There is 1 on 1 available but the person will not sleep in the same room, therefore this is only a 12-hour deal. Independent section, on the other hand, has room with double beds or a small storage room that can be used for helper's bedroom. Each room has two beds so it is shared. However, not many patients on the floor I visited so many rooms are open to pick. The sales we spoke to knew the services well. There were a few occasions that residents greeted her so she was well recognized and people seemed like her. The atmosphere was light hearted and easygoing, which was a comforting sign. 苏州怡养园 Facility is similar to its independent care section with an added nurse frontdesk. Nurse was there chatting with an old guy on wheelchair. The old man wanted to make a call to his son and so she helped him that. I couldn't tell whether it was a pretended call or real. The old guy started talking to the person on the other end of the phone that 你怎么还不来阿，他们对我不好... and the nurse and a few people nearby looked at the scene and thought it was funny. There was no sign that a visitor like me may be disturbed by such a message however unreal it may be. This made me quite uncomfortable. We visited at their lunch time. There were about 30 patients, 5 to 6 per table. Same cookie cutter food (see photo) with no personal care to feed them even though one person apparently had trouble finding his mouth. All were wearing an apron (their way to keep them tidy). There was little conversation between staff and the olds. Another thing that brushed me the wrong side was that I was allowed to take photos of them sitting at desk eating or waiting for their food despite of the No photo is allowed sign on wall. Neither the sales nor the nurse showed any sign of warning. I felt bad for these olds sitting there as if they were on display. Helpers were mostly country looking midage male and females, reminding me the staff who used to work in my college cateferia. Nurse at the front desk is a girl in her 20s. Each room has the old's photo posted but there were few personal belongs such as photos. The whole place made me feel that person touch was there for a show. Sales were a young guy with busy phone calls throughout our conversation. He lacked knowledge (or there just wasn't any) of service details and used common skills to skim through my questions without giving straight answers. Further, I met the head doctor, a woman in her mid-40s, who appeared to be knowledgeable of Alzhymer symptoms. We were discussing about medical evaluation options, during which she brought up a few times that they are not responsible for medical conditions and will send the old to hospital if medical attention is needed. Even though this is mutually understood, but she made feel a lack of will to be responsible in general. Both these two people talked with shifting eyes looking at each other as if to sync the message. This turned me off. 上海泰康(申园) Facility is absolutely top notch. The library room and movie theater were impressive. There were cleaning staff throughout the building and everything was nearly spotless. All elevators are equipped with a bench where the olds can sit down — a nice touch. Facility includes a full scale hospital and its 19th and 20th floor are dedicated dementia (they call it memory loss ) sections. Section is guarded with double security doors and required badge access. We run into the young girl who is charge of this section. First impression was good. She felt 很细心, not rushing to speak when asked and knew her stuff very well. She has a notebook with patient's schedule and observation notes. Each patient's are listed in 30-min intervals with handwriting notes of the person's preference, habit, things staff should pay attention. When we wanted to sit down in community room for further discussion, the sales girl asked for her permission and she closed door behind us. It was apparent that protecting the patient's space was well observed. Also, photo of patient was strictly prohibited. Another plus point. I visited at their lunch time. There were two young girl at desk helping three olders, one was being fed by a young girl. The others had no trouble eating by themselves. They actually appeared completly normal. Nurse at frontdesk were also helping at desk which is located right in front of the nurse counter. The girls know these patients well and can elaborate their features, habits, and often their recent changes. The conversation between them were soft, kind and not demeaning in any way. Patient has single room. Occupied rooms are off the limit for visitors and doors were all shut. This was another difference from the other sites, at which sales were inviting me to look into others' as a showroom. A highlight of this visit was when I was impressing how little one can do to help them. The woman manager countered that they created simple games for them, similar to ones for babies, and \"他们可以作这些简单的 游戏\". There is also nutritionist who is responsible to each patient's meals. Overall, in this place I felt hopeful , and what a priceless feeling anyone can wish for right now? 上海凯健Cascade Health This was a complete disappointment. The sales contact were not there and the frontdesk boy she directed me knew next to nothing about the service and price. Walking around the facility was rather depressing also. First, the location bragged river view (by 黄浦江). Yet the section of that water can at most be called a creek. Forget about the view, I suspect there is even much water in that canal. Many sections of the facility had no lights. Since it was a cloudy day the whole place felt poor lit and damp. I peeked into a few rooms in both sections. There were couples living together with likely their own furniture since they look awefully familiar to those I found in 江 南 homes — all dark colored and looked heavy. All room doors were semi-opened which is another living custom among southerners. There were physical therapy for patients who are paralyzed. I couldn't however tell how well it was received or performed. Since little information the boy was able to provide, the tour was short, dry and little helpful. Oh well, so much for an international name.

To get in it requires 200k deposit and 3-month fee, an all-inclusive 24k per month → 280k at first payment. Each following month payment can be handled by dividing it into three tranches: Dad's pension: 7000 Suzhou fund: 10000 Feng: 7000 First of all, this is sustainable. Suzhou fund has plenty to sustain in that rate and will leave good amount reserve for rainy days. My portion is affordable with my current job. Second, this makes it possible that we all keep our current job and family setup without much change. Of course being nearby is still preferred. But this level of service makes one feel comfortable to leave for job or travel if needed. Third, Mom may join. If the facility is inviting for her, she can decide to join nursing home soon, thus making an arrangement now instead of later. To afford this we will make it clear that one of the two houses must be used for the support. This can also help her to realize the tradeoff and, if so, use the equity for true need instead of paper profit. Not to mention liquidation now also lessen the hassles of their will concerns.","tags":"thoughts","url":"https://fengxia41103.github.io/myblog/nursing%20home%20evaluation.html"},{"title":"My la la land","text":"Maybe it's the travel, maybe it's the stress of my dad's worsening health condition, maybe I'm tired from all these and trying the impossible without knowing the loss is done already.

Why cannt I stand by a thought and take its consequence instead of saddening when it is lost but cannt hold on when it's there? There hasn't been a movie touched me like this for a long time. But this one hit me to the core. I don't know. Why cannt people hold on to love and go through the so called realities and come out cherishing each other more? Shouldn't the common struggle and experience and the talk and the happy and unhappy moments become a milestone that marks the path both have walked, together? How many times can you really walk with someone so close, so intimate, so letting all guards down, weaving the image into a future that two, instead of one, are in it? I hate the ending of this movie. I just hate it. Fxxk reality, fxxk success. It means nothing, absolutely nothing, to me if success is here and the person I cherished is gone. What is the point? whom are you showing the trophy to? who has been cheerleading you and give you the strength and courage to get you where you are?

This article is to dive into its source code in order to understand its execution logic and design philosophy. In this article we will study charm's reactive framework to get a firm understanding of what they mean by writing an reactive charm. Hooks Decorator: @hook Definition: charm.reactive/charms/reactive/decorators.py Hooks give one a dedicated sequence that execution is guaranteed in that order and developer can use @hook to define a function block to run. Sequence of charm hooks Hooks have a few limitations which affect the usefulness of this mechanism: Hooks are really meant to be used for internal workflow transitions. There are only 8 of them and they represent a specific stage in the life cycle of a charm. There is no mechanism to extend or inherit these built-ins. install config-changed start upgrade-charm stop update-status leader-elected leader-settings-changed Hook sequence is hardcoded . This is defined in juju/worker/uniter/operation/runhook.go . In other words, the transition from install to upgrade-charm is both guaranteed and mandatory. This limits how we can design our workflows. States Decorator: @not_unless , @only_once , @when , @when_all , @when_any , @when_file_changed , @when_none , @when_not , @when_not_all Definition: charm.reactive/charms/reactive/decorators.py States were probably designed to fix the limitation that Hooks present. States can be defined using arbitrary string except two reserved words juju and jujud . Further, workflow of states are not fixed. States are evaluated iteratively and a true condition will execute associated function block. When a state is true? What defines a true ? The code is defined in class StateWatch in file charm.reactive/charms/reactive/bus.py . The value changed is true when there are states to monitor ( set(states) is not empty) and there are changes ( data['changes] is not empty). class StateWatch ( object ): ... @classmethod def watch ( cls , watcher , states ): data = cls . _get () iteration = data [ 'iteration' ] changed = bool ( set ( states ) & set ( data [ 'changes' ])) return iteration == 0 or changed What defines the values in data['changes'] ? There are only two places to set this value: set_state(...) and remove_state(...) . Looking at set_state reveals that if the state is already in old_states list, it will not be set to changed , therefore the watch will fail to identify this state and will not trigger an execution. In other words, if a state becomes true , it will not be re-evaluated until it is reset to false first. Reactive charm triggers only on state transitions: False->True ( @when ) or True->False ( @when_not ). def set_state ( state , value = None ): \"\"\" Set the given state as active, optionally associating with a relation. \"\"\" old_states = get_states () unitdata . kv () . update ({ state : value }, prefix = 'reactive.states.' ) if state not in old_states : StateWatch . change ( state ) Namespace There isn't really a namespace concept in charm. I'm borrowing the term to illustrate state boundaries. The question is that if I can define arbitrary states, in which scope are they visible? Can state.xyz in charm A trigger an action in charm B? or in another layer? or in another unit? or even a bundle? To answer this, we need to examine how states are stored. The key information can be found in charmhelpers/core/unitdata.py — this is the storage class that is used by charm to store states. Clearly the backend is a sqlite3 database. class Storage ( object ): \"\"\"Simple key value database for local unit state within charms. Modifications are not persisted unless :meth:`flush` is called. To support dicts, lists, integer, floats, and booleans values are automatically json encoded/decoded. \"\"\" def __init__ ( self , path = None ): self . db_path = path if path is None : if 'UNIT_STATE_DB' in os . environ : self . db_path = os . environ [ 'UNIT_STATE_DB' ] else : self . db_path = os . path . join ( os . environ . get ( 'CHARM_DIR' , '' ), '.unit-state.db' ) self . conn = sqlite3 . connect ( ' %s ' % self . db_path ) self . cursor = self . conn . cursor () .... Function _init(self) reveals the table schema in this database — three tables: kv , kv_revisions and hooks . kv is the primary store as can be seen in the set_state function above ( unitdata.kv().update(.... ). def _init ( self ): self . cursor . execute ( ''' create table if not exists kv ( key text, data text, primary key (key) )''' ) self . cursor . execute ( ''' create table if not exists kv_revisions ( key text, revision integer, data text, primary key (key, revision) )''' ) self . cursor . execute ( ''' create table if not exists hooks ( version integer primary key autoincrement, hook text, date text )''' ) self . conn . commit () What is not obvious is that each unit has its own DB. Therefore, the boundary of states are per charm unit . In other words, states are visible inside a unit. Using layers will package states inside a single charm, but in run time it is the unit boundary that matters. States do not go across charms. Using the same charm, states do not go across units either. Dispatch Reading function dispatch in charms.reactive/charms/reactive/bus.py is interesting because there is certainly something no document has mentioned. Dispatch is done in two phases: hooks and other . Hooks are run in the hooks phase. Registered hook will run its test() so this scan will test all hooks. def _test ( to_test ): return list ( filter ( lambda h : h . test (), to_test )) .... unitdata . kv () . set ( 'reactive.dispatch.phase' , 'hooks' ) hook_handlers = _test ( Handler . get_handlers ()) _invoke ( hook_handlers ) States are run in the other phase. The magic number 100 for-loop highlights an underline assumption that states can converge within these iterations. Otherwise, state watch is reset and will be count from 0 again during next iteration → state effect can then ripple through one single iteration. unitdata . kv () . set ( 'reactive.dispatch.phase' , 'other' ) for i in range ( 100 ): StateWatch . iteration ( i ) other_handlers = _test ( Handler . get_handlers ()) if not other_handlers : break _invoke ( other_handlers )","tags":"openstack","url":"https://fengxia41103.github.io/myblog/juju%20charm%20reactive.html"},{"title":"Charm chained states","text":"This charm is created to demonstrate chained states using Juju charm. Chained states is essentially mirroring a pattern of any sequential execution in a workflow. Potentially each execution block can also have conditions to set the next state, even though this type of knowledge should be exposed outside function element, if possible, and to be handled by something better than pure code (eg. BPMN). The model for this experiment is straightforward. We create a layer with three states: state.1 , state.2 , and state.3 . Upon start charm kicks off execution of state.1 , which then transit itself to the state.2 , then to state.3 , and then loop back to state.1 . Charm design pattern: chain states The key questions to answer in this experiment are: What is the entry point to start the first state? If setting two states true, are they executed serially or in parallel? Can a blocking command halt state transition even if there are states being true and can be acted upon? Screencast Top left window shows the juju debug-log which prints state transition among three states. Top right window juju status also shows state transitions in Message column which is set by set_status in each state's function block. Charm chain states screencast The 1st state How to start the first state? In this test we experimented using hooks to introduce the first state since hooks are executed in a predetermined sequence. However, set_state has no effect and actually should be avoided within hook execution according to document (needs reference). To safely start the whole process, we settled on @only_once : @only_once def state_0 (): log ( 'something------------------' ) Chain state pattern The three primary states follow the same pattern. Using state.1 for example: @when ( 'state.1' ) def state_1 (): \"\"\"State.1 \"\"\" # set status t = time . ctime ( time . time ()) status_set ( 'maintenance' , 'state.1 %s ' % t ) # workload time . sleep ( TEST_TIMEOUT ) # state transition remove_state ( 'state.1' ) set_state ( 'state.2' ) Multiple states being true If we set multiple states true , will they be executed in parallel? From previous article on state execution, we can already see that states are first saved in a dictionary and then scanned by iterator. Therefore, there is no parallel computing built in the charm execution mechanism. Further, execution order of two states have no guarantee except they will all be done sooner or later because Python dictionary does not enforce any order. Multiple true states will be executed in serial. Orders of execution is undetermined. Long running process Will a shell blocking call halt state transition? In this test we want to verify whether starting a long running process will block charm's state transition. We used subprocess.check_all to start a blocking call while state 1-3 are kept to loop as designed. def state_4 (): \"\"\"State4. \"\"\" subprocess . check_all ( \"apt update && apt dist-upgrade\" ) The result is clear that state machine will come to a halt at this blocking call, which would have to be the case since we already know how states are being scanned and executed from previous article . All states are cached in a dictionary and are scanned in a tight loop per iteration. Thus a blocking call in any handler will cause the loop to a halt. Nowhere in code will take a signal so this behavior can not be interruptted either.","tags":"openstack","url":"https://fengxia41103.github.io/myblog/juju%20charm%20chained%20states.html"},{"title":"You got mail","text":"After becoming an Emacs user for the last few months, I acquired a burning desire to migrate as much as my daily text editing activities into Emacs environment, in particular, emails. Having tried offlineimap for a bit, I ended up battling its configuration to make it work (sort of) with Hotmail's IMAP. Gmail worked flawlessly, but boy, Microsoft, get a grip. No wonder hotmail is dying. But in the end I'm just one guy who holds on something linking my youth days, for sentimental purpose. So without being able to win the battle with offlineimap, I started searching for alternatives, then I found mbsync . Its man page is worth a read. It looks intimidating at first glance, but it isn't really. In a nutshell, it defines three things: A remote store : this also links to an Account , which of course holds your email credentials. A local store : this defines local file structure where you want to emails to be downloaded to. A channel : a link that connects the a remote store with a local store. mbsync components Account Acount sections define your email accounts: for hotmail: imap.outlook.com for gmail: imap.gmail.com # Hotmail account IMAPAccount hotmail # <-- user defined name Host imap.outlook.com # or imap.gmail.com User yours email address Pass xxxx # These settings work for both gmail and hotmail UseIMAPS yes RequireSSL yes # This might be Ubuntu 16.04 specific CertificateFile /etc/ssl/certs/ca-certificates.crt certs Whiling setting up corporate one, for which you are likely looking at a outlook server on the other end, I ran into an error cert is not matching the server's. To solve this, we actually need to pull down a new cert (from the mail server itself) and config CertificateFile to that file. I followed the steps here .

It turned out that each IMAP server structures things differently, eg. using Inbox vs. INBOX , how confusing. Helped by this blog , it turned out we can login into the IMAP server (manually) and investigate what we are looking at: openssl s_client -crlf -connect [ your company IMAP server ] :993 Once you see something like this * OK Gimap ready for requests from 200.199.23.105 o16if3544685ybc.1111 , you are in. There won't be any commandline prompt , it just sits there. So keep going: tag login user@company.com password tag LIST \"\" \"*\" Viol la! Look what we have got! tag login fxia1@company.com password tag OK LOGIN completed. tag LIST \"\" \"*\" * LIST ( \\H asChildren ) \"/\" Archives * LIST ( \\H asNoChildren ) \"/\" Archives/2017 * LIST ( \\H asNoChildren ) \"/\" \"Archives/juju mailing list\" * LIST ( \\H asNoChildren ) \"/\" Calendar * LIST ( \\H asNoChildren ) \"/\" Contacts * LIST ( \\M arked \\H asNoChildren ) \"/\" \"Conversation History\" * LIST ( \\M arked \\H asNoChildren ) \"/\" \"Deleted Items\" * LIST ( \\H asNoChildren ) \"/\" Drafts * LIST ( \\M arked \\H asChildren ) \"/\" INBOX * LIST ( \\H asChildren ) \"/\" INBOX/administration * LIST ( \\H asNoChildren ) \"/\" INBOX/administration/something * LIST ( \\H asNoChildren ) \"/\" INBOX/administration/hr * LIST ( \\H asNoChildren ) \"/\" INBOX/administration/akjd * LIST ( \\H asNoChildren ) \"/\" INBOX/administration/wow * LIST ( \\H asNoChildren ) \"/\" INBOX/administration/workday * LIST ( \\H asChildren ) \"/\" INBOX/Canonical * LIST ( \\H asNoChildren ) \"/\" INBOX/Canonical/juju * LIST ( \\H asNoChildren ) \"/\" \"INBOX/home improvement\" * LIST ( \\H asNoChildren ) \"/\" INBOX/miro * LIST ( \\H asNoChildren ) \"/\" \"INBOX/no need to read\" * LIST ( \\H asChildren ) \"/\" INBOX/team ............ So the key to notice here is that this IMAP server uses capitalized INBOX . Therefore, to pull all sub-folders into, we need to setup mbsync as such: Channel your-inbox-sub Master :your-remote: \"INBOX/\" <<-- must match what you saw from server, case -sensitive Slave :your-local:inbox/ Pattern * Create Both Expunge Both SyncState * Now if you issue mbsync your-inbox-sub will pull in all INBOX and its subfolders . Awesome. gmail — less secured Sending username and pwd to login in Gmail will be blocked. A couple things you need to do: Go to settings and enable IMAP. Go to https://www.google.com/settings/security/lesssecureapps to enable Less secured app setting. Make sure the folder defined in Account section for local store actually exists ( mbsync will not create ~/Maildir/Hotmail for you!) Outlook webmail davmail settings Working outlook/exchange server is tough. The company's server changes configuration all the time, and it completly messed up w/ IMAP login when one server allows PLAIN while another requires NTLM , and so on. It has been a nightmare, because it worked for weeks, months, and will suddenly decided to stop working, and you don't get emails anymore! Fall back is Thunderbird, but then, once you are used to mu4e , going back to anything looked like outlook is a pain. Finally, here is a savior, davmail 1 . It works a gateway between your computer and outlook web mail (aka. OWA — outlook web access). So you can now point your mbsync to a local port (default 1143 , and davmail will route mbsync's IMAP requests to the remote OWA server, nice! The mbsync config is quite straightforward: IMAPAccount company-name Host localhost <-- using davmail as gateway User xxx Pass xxx Port 1143 <-- default davmail IMAP port SSLType None AuthMech LOGIN and here is the davmail settings (copy it to ~/.davmail.properties ). The best way to run it is to use a tmux, then run it as background process davmail & . Alternatively, you can set davmail.server=true , then use nohup . But w/ tmux running dettached session., I really don't see any benefit of doing this anymore. My mbsync setup for retrieving and sending mails Btw, I was having issue w/ v5.3.1. Downgrade it to 5.2 (released in Aug 2019) worked out better. ↩","tags":"dev","url":"https://fengxia41103.github.io/myblog/mbsync%20mu4e%20email.html"},{"title":"MAAS vs. Ironic","text":"This article is to analyze Openstack Ironic and Canonical MAAS, both are tools to turn baremetal into a pool of managed resources that are ready for consumption by upstream srervice. On the highest level, a baremetal is either managed or not-managed. Being managed requires that the manager is aware of the existence of the baremetal, and has acquired necessary information of the server so that these two things are now possible: Power cycle the server Install a software such as operating system The general process of managing a baremetal is straightforward. Baremetal life cycle can be viewed in the following states. Names and details of each state and state transitions differ, but the concept remains valid. unknown : Baremetal is not managed. enlisted : Manager is now aware of the existence of the baremetal. It does not yet have sufficient information to cycle its power or loading anything to execute on it. ready for provisioning : Sometimes also called hardware inventory phase, in which the manager has acquired capability to control the server's power. Knowing other server characteristics is not really required if using PXE boot during provisioning because the first image loaded can potentially does more inventory when it runs. provisioned : an operating system or a bootable file systems have been written to a disk that will be used by the server from this point on. in use : The server is running user workload. maintenance mode : a catch-all state that a baremetal is not available for use in normal states and needs operator intervene. General baremetal life cycle Comparison framework Using their APIs as reference, we have grouped their functions into the following subject domains for discussion purpose: minimal setup power select boot order new server discovery and enlisting server inventory image OS provisioning networking storage and partition deployment customization server grouping multi-tenant Minimal setup Minimal setup MAAS Ironic DHCP service y y TFTP service y \"no\" is using diskless image y \"no\" if using iSCSI drivers External image repo n y BMC network depends on driver depends on driver Tenant network y y Provision network y y MAAS minimal setup Ironic minimal setup Power The minimum capability in managing power includes two aspects: querying current power state and set power state. Both Ironic and MAAS support IPMI interface. MAAS's has more vendor centric implementations where Ironic's are more general purposed.

Ironic, however, supports selecting boot device using *_ipmitool drivers. It also has vendor passthrough feature which allows passing in vendor specific instructions in driver, thus giving the possibility to manipulate the server beyond standard functions. New server discovery and enlisting Server discovery and enlisting MAAS Ironic Discover new server y n Enlisting MAC address auto manual MAAS can discover new server by monitoring DHCP data packet given that MAAS is the DHCP server serving the subnet that baremetals are connected to. Discovered server will be registered as NEW and is ready for inventory. At this point MAAS has only the MAC address that was broadcasted from DHCPREQUEST. Ironic has no method to auto-discover a new server. It can only register them through command line or its API interface. So it requires either a manual process (command line) or programming. But because of this enlisting a node in Ironic term can include a wealthy of information more than its MAC address. Server inventory Server inventory MAAS Ironic CPU y y Memory size y y Partition size y y Network interface y y Mechanism cloud-init running scripts special ramdisk Server inventory is to inspect the server for hardware features such as the number of CPUs, memory size, disk size and partition. MAAS handles this in a separate step, Commission , after discovery, where this is optional in Ironic. MAAS does so by loading a minimal Ubuntu image at next boot and run commissioning scripts to harvest system information: DHCP server is contacted kernel and initrd are received over TFTP machine boots initrd mounts a Squashfs image ephemerally over iSCSI cloud-init runs commissioning scripts machine shuts down Ironic, on the other hand, relies on a separate setup, Ironic Inspector to orchestrate this process (see steps below). The principle is the same that Inspector will acquire credentials to manage the node power from Ironic, then using that to PXE rebooting the node and load a ramdisk. The difference is, however, that ramdisk is not limited to Ubuntu. Operator sends nodes on introspection using ironic-inspector API or CLI On receiving node UUID ironic-inspector: validates node power credentials, current power and provisioning states, allows firewall access to PXE boot service for the nodes, issues reboot command for the nodes, so that they boot the ramdisk. The ramdisk collects the required information and posts it back to ironic-inspector. On receiving data from the ramdisk, ironic-inspector: validates received data, finds the node in Ironic database using it's BMC address (MAC address in case of SSH driver), fills missing node properties with received data and creates missing ports. Image Image MAAS Ironic Build-in image repo y n Ubuntu y y CentOS y y SUSE y y Windows server y y RHEL n y MAAS has built-in capability to work as an image repository. Ironic relies on helper service, such as Glance, to handle images. In src/provisioningservers/drivers/osystem/__init__.py , MAAS categories images into five usages: commissioning, install (regular ISO image), xinstall (.tgz of root / ), diskless( tgt-admin ) and bootloader. MAAS has a fair restricted list of what it supports, where Ironic is happy to use any bootable image since it delegates this management to other service such as Glance. Details of MAAS image handling can be found in src/provisioningservers/drivers/osystem . Here is a list defaults MAAS supports: Ubuntu: all LTS releases CentOS: 6.5 SUSE: openSUSE 13.1 Windows: Windows Server 2012 Windows Server 2012 R2 Windows Hyper-V Server 2012 Windows Hyper-V Server 2012 R2 Windows Server 2016 Windows Nano Server 2016 One can also use MAAS CLI to add custom images to repo, where name must in format custom/xxx . For CentOS, the name must be in format centos72 for example because of MAAS's regex parser. maas local boot-resources create name = custom/foo title = \"Title is not important\" architecture = amd64/generic content@ = /path/to/your/image maas local boot-resources import OS provisioning OS provisioning MAAS Ironic PXE y y iSCSI y y Select boot order n y Agent-based deployment n/a y Post-seed operation cloud-init cloud configdrive First of all, both support PXE. This is standard and not much to talk about. In term of iSCSI, both has implementation, but with different objectives. Ironic conductor( code ) will use the SCSI disk to write image data; MAAS, on the other hand, uses tgt-admin for the job, and its objective is to re-use an existing root / file system. Second, MAAS lacks the capability to change boot order. Therefore, a provisioned server will be seemed out of management from that point on because booting from HD is now preferred instead of PXE. It solves this chicken-egg problem by installing a default account and SSH credential so they can continue management. Instead, Ironic can use IPMI driver to set boot device so it does not create such artificial user account in the system. Third, Ironic has an agent-based deployment method that a ramdisk with IPA installed will be loaded first. Once the agent is running, it can take further commands including partitioning ( parted ), mounting remote disk (iSCSI), cleaning disk, and write OS image to disk. Fourth, post-seed operation. MAAS API can accept a Base64 encoded user-data string used by cloud-init in next boot, where Ironic API can accept cloud configdrive string. Networking Networking MAAS Ironic Serve DHCP y n/a Use static IP y n/a Limite IP ranges y n/a Store node's IP y y Store subnet y n Store VLAN y n Concept of subnet grouping space n/a Concept of VLAN grouping fabric n/a Ironic does not handle networking. In Openstack, Neutron will be providing this service. MAAS understands subnet and vlan . Subnets can be further grouped into space and vlans into fabric . It also supports container fan network , which Neutron has no support either. Further, MAAS can reserve IP ranges to assign to discovered nodes, CRUD interface on a particular node, link an interface to a VLAN, and even create a bridge interface on node. None of these Ironic can do or care. Storage and partition Storage and partition MAAS Ironic Can configure disk partitions y n/a Can deploy partition image y n Can put partition on logical volume n n/a MAAS API supports CRUD operations for partitions. According to its document , it bears a few limitations: An EFI partition is required to be on the boot disk for UEFI. You cannot place partitions on logical volumes. You cannot use a logical volume as a Bcache backing device. Ironic has no API in this regards. By default it will only deploy image to full disk. A spec has been called for to handle partition image implemented through IPA . Deployment customization Deployment customization MAAS Ironic use custom image y y user scripts during inspection, commissioning scripts n cloud-init y n cloud configdrive n y kernel options y n Both can boot from a custom image (see \"Image\" for details). MAAS provides three more entry points to influence the result: commissioning scripts, kernel option , and cloud-init user-data . Commissioning scripts are run to collect server hardware information. Kernel options can be either global or per-node based. One can also pass on a cloud-init user-data string that MAAS will use in booting. Similarly, Ironic API accepts cloud configdrive string. Since it can have an agent-based deployment, it is also possible to instruct the agent to run some commands or scripts. However, there is no method to pass in kernel options. Server grouping Server grouping MAAS Ironic chassis n y rack n n region y n zone y n MAAS has created concept of zone and zones can be further grouped into region . As a matter of fact, MAAS also has a concept of region controller which can then manage multiple rack controller . From MAAS document : Zone: A physical zone, or just zone, is an organizational unit that contains nodes where each node is in one, and only one, zone. Later, while in production, a node can be taken (allocated) from a specific zone (or not from a specific zone). Since zones, by nature, are custom-designed (with the exception of the 'default' zone), they provide more flexibility than a similar feature offered by a public cloud service (ex: availability zones). Some prime examples of how zones can be put to use include fault-tolerance, service performance, and power management. A newly installed MAAS comes with a default zone, and unless a new zone is created all nodes get placed within it. You can therefore safely ignore the entire concept if you're not interested in leveraging zones. The 'default' zone cannot be removed and its name cannot be edited. Ironic provides no similar grouping concept. That level of management is left for other service (eg. NOVA) to handle. Multi-tenant Multi-tenant MAAS Ironic Support multi-tenant separation n y MAAS has no capability to manipulate an existing network layout. Its concept of fabric and space are artificial groupings only. Therefore, it has no say in multi-tenant support. In many cases, baremetal servers are put on the same network — provisioning network — as the MAAS server because that's how MAAS can discover and enlist new servers, thus exposing all tenants to each other (see section \"Minimal setup\" for details.) Ironic has not concept of multi-tenant either. However, it can dynamically bind a port to use, where port is then managed by service such as Neutron. This leaves Ironic not suffering from the same risk that MAAS setup may have.","tags":"openstack","url":"https://fengxia41103.github.io/myblog/maas%20and%20ironic.html"},{"title":"Baremetal provisioning","text":"Everyone of us has installed an operating system to a computer at some point in life. It is easy to perceive inserting a disk or USB key to make this happen because the OS files are there . A fancier version is to boot from network using PXE boot option, which seems like a magic (when the environment has been setup) — it somehow finds the OS image and start installing, all over a network ! Now if we move to the world of servers, it works the same way. Baremetal is another name referring to a server that has no operating system (or hypervisor) installed yet. But the challenge is to physically access to it to insert that OS disk — in a data center setting, I think the walking part is neither fun nor desired. Remote provisioning is, therefore, the way to go. First, let's define provisioning . Here we mean to have installed an operating system or hypervisor on a baremetal so it is available for further software installation. In the simplest term, one needs to answer these three questions: Minimal setup for baremetal provisioning What is my address? . If using BOOTP, the address will be static; if using DHCP, it can be either static or dynamic. Which boot file to use? . Also referred as Network Bootstrap Program (NBP) . This is controlled by a boot service. BOOTP can provide this service, so is DHCP. This can be as simple as a static list mapping client's architecture to a file. But it can also be a very specific so a client can get a completly customized file. Also, the file must be in some pre-determined format based on client's architecture so the client knows how to execute it. How to download the file? . This is handled by TFTP protocol. Boot file is often pretty minimal. Once the file is downloaded and loaded in memory, baremetal's firmware will start its execution, which can then take over the machine and possibly pull down another image, such as the actual OS image, and then hand over the execution to OS's bootloader. BOOTP, DHCP — address and boot file list When a client is connected, it needs an address. Two services are created for this task — BOOTP and DHCP. In addition, both will boot service by telling the client which boot file to use. BOOTP is an earlier IETF-defined booting protocol that is much less flexible than DHCP. However, DHCP has been defined to be upwardly compatible with BOOTP and both these protocols can coexist and function simultaneously in the same network. BOOTP is about address determination and bootfile selection . From its spec , we can derive a sequence diagram shown below: BOOTP sequence diagram One major characteristic of BOOTP is that it is static , meaning when server looks up the client information, such as its IP address, it is using a static table (the database referred in the diagram above is actually a plain text file). Therefore, everytime client asks for its information, it will get the same result. Below shows the format of a BOOTP data packet. This same format in both directions. BOOTP data packet DHCP's data packet is nearly identical to BOOTP's for compatibility reason. Same ports (67 on the server side & 68 on the client side) are used. Below shows a simplified DHCP cycles ( source ): Simplified DHCP sequence diagram TFTP — download boot file At this point, client has acquired an address and knows which file to download. Next, it needs to contact a file server to get the file. Here comes TFTP. TFTP is a very simple protocol used to transfer files. It is from this that its name comes, Trivial File Transfer Protocol or TFTP. Each nonterminal packet is acknowledged separately. It has been implemented on top of the Internet User Datagram protocol (UDP or Datagram) so it may be used to move files between machines on different networks implementing UDP. The only thing it can do is read and write files (or mail) from/to a remote server → no user authentication. Two modes of transfer are currently supported: ASCII (8-bit) and octet (raw 8-bit bytes). Note that spec defines 3rd mode message but it is obsoleted. Between client and server, everything is transported as a data packet , and each data packet includes a op code which indicates the meaning of this packet as well as the rest of data structure. The spec has nice illustration of the data formats so I'll copy & paste them here for reference: TFTP data packet formats: Type Op # Format without header ---- ---- -------------------- 2 bytes string 1 byte string 1 byte ----------------------------------------------- RRQ/ | 01 /02 | Filename | 0 | Mode | 0 | WRQ ----------------------------------------------- 2 bytes 2 bytes n bytes --------------------------------- DATA | 03 | Block # | Data | --------------------------------- 2 bytes 2 bytes ------------------- ACK | 04 | Block # | -------------------- 2 bytes 2 bytes string 1 byte ---------------------------------------- ERROR | 05 | ErrorCode | ErrMsg | 0 | ---------------------------------------- OP codes: opcode operation ----- --------- 1 Read request ( RRQ ) 2 Write request ( WRQ ) 3 Data ( DATA ) 4 Acknowledgment ( ACK ) 5 Error ( ERROR ) Error codes: Value Meaning ----- ------- 0 Not defined, see error message ( if any ) . 1 File not found. 2 Access violation. 3 Disk full or allocation exceeded. 4 Illegal TFTP operation. 5 Unknown transfer ID. 6 File already exists. 7 No such user. Additionally, server always listens to a pre-known port (known as transfer identifier ) to begin with. In its first returning data packet, it can change this to a different port by setting the Source Port , and client will then only accept packets bearing this port number. However, client has not such default. Since client is to initialize the contact, it's free to tell the server which port it uses. UDP header format: 0 1 2 3 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 0 1 +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+ | Source Port | Destination Port | +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+ | Length | Checksum | +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+ where the values of fields are: Source Port : Picked by originator of packet. Dest. Port : Picked by destination machine (69 for RRQ or WRQ). Length : Number of bytes in UDP packet, including UDP header. Checksum : Reference 2 describes rules for computing checksum. (The implementor of this should be sure that the correct algorithm is used here.) Field contains zero if unused. TFTP sequence diagram Preboote Execution Environment (PXE) Once we put BOOTP/DHCP and TFTP together, we will have an environment suitable for client to select PXE boot. Being such a core technology used widely in baremetal provisioning, the Preboot Execution Environment (PXE) Specification Version 2.1 should be the first document to read. Honestly I'm amazed how well it was written, thought through, clearly defined, and neatly illustrated, all dated back in 1999! As its name indicates, PXE provides a runtime environment prior to an OS. A detailed step-by-step diagram is reproduced below (remade from Figure 2-1 in the PXE Spec ). In a nutshell, it takes three services to make a PXE working: DHCP service : This service handles the initial contact by a client. However, its primary function is not in offering an IP address . Instead, after the first handshakes, it offers clients a list of Boot services to choose from so client can move on to obtain NBP. Boot service : The service essentially maintains a map between client architecture (defined in PXE Client System Architecture Type Option Definition , values below) and NBP file names. So in modern term, it would have been called NBP registry or something like that. There can be more than one Boot services co-existed. It is up to the client to choose. According to the spec , PXE 2.1 supports the following client architectures: ```shell Type Architecture Name ---- ----------------- 0 Intel x86PC 1 NEC/PC98 2 EFI Itanium 3 DEC Alpha 4 Arc x86 5 Intel Lean Client 6 EFI IA32 7 EFI BC 8 EFI Xscale 9 EFI x86-64 ``` TFTP service : The actual server that will serve the NBP file for client to download. PXE boot sequence diagram Copying and pasting the detailed explanation from the PXE Spec below with merely a few reformatting. Step 1 The client broadcasts a DHCPDISCOVER message to the standard DHCP port (67). An option field in this packet contains the following: A tag for client identifier (UUID). A tag for the client UNDI version. A tag for the client system architecture. A DHCP option 60, Class ID, set to PXEClient:Arch:xxxxx:UNDI:yyyzzz . Step 2 The DHCP or Proxy DHCP Service responds by sending a DHCPOFFER message to the client on the standard DHCP reply port (68). If this is a Proxy DHCP Service, then the client IP address field is null ( 0.0.0.0 ). If this is a DHCP Service, then the returned client IP address field is valid. At this point, other DHCP Services and BOOTP Services also respond with DHCP offers or BOOTP reply messages to port (68). Each message contains standard DHCP parameters: an IP address for the client and any other parameters that the administrator might have configured on the DHCP or Proxy DHCP Service. Step 3 From the DHCPOFFER(s) that it receives, the client records the following: The Client IP address (and other parameters) offered by a standard DHCP or BOOTP Service. The Boot Server list from the Boot Server field in the PXE tags from the DHCPOFFER . The Discovery Control Options (if provided). The Multicast Discovery IP address (if provided). Step 4 If the client selects an IP address offered by a DHCP Service, then it must complete the standard DHCP protocol by sending a request for the address back to the Service and then waiting for an acknowledgment from the Service. If the client selects an IP address from a BOOTP reply, it can simply use the address. Step 5 The client selects and discovers a Boot Server. This packet may be sent broadcast (port 67), multicast (port 4011), or unicast (port 4011) depending on discovery control options included in the previous DHCPOFFER containing the PXE service extension tags. This packet is the same as the initial DHCPDISCOVER in Step 1, except that it is coded as a DHCPREQUEST and now contains the following: The IP address assigned to the client from a DHCP Service. A tag for client identifier (UUID) A tag for the client UNDI version. A tag for the client system architecture. A DHCP option 60, Class ID, set to PXEClient:Arch:xxxxx:UNDI:yyyzzz . The Boot Server type in a PXE option field Step 6 The Boot Server unicasts a DHCPACK packet back to the client on the client source port. This reply packet contains: Boot file name. MTFTP1 configuration parameters. Any other options the NBP requires before it can be successfully executed. Step 7 The client downloads the executable file using either standard TFTP (port69) or MTFTP (port assigned in Boot Server Ack packet). The file downloaded and the placement of the downloaded code in memory is dependent on the client's CPU architecture. Step 8 The PXE client determines whether an authenticity test on the downloaded file is required. If the test is required, the client sends another DHCPREQUEST message to the boot server requesting a credentials file for the previously downloaded boot file, downloads the credentials via TFTP or MTFTP, and performs the authenticity test. Step 9 Finally, if the authenticity test succeeded or was not required, then the PXE client initiates execution of the downloaded code Initial Program Load (IPL) At this step, we have a NBP and is ready to load the image, and this all boils down to the good-old days that how to link a hardware interrupt with software interrupt so the initial BIOS will be able to load register with a specific memory location where the NBP image resides. Option ROM Option ROM : ROM associated with a plug and play device. May be located on the device or in non-volatile storage on a system. An Option ROM is used to extend the services or capabilities of the BIOS prior to IPL. It is the only way, other than directly modifying the BIOS, that new devices may be added to the IPL process. During POST, the BIOS scans the Upper Memory area for Option ROMs that have been mapped into this space by adapter cards plugged into a system expansion bus. A valid Option ROM begins on a 2KB boundary and contains a data structure with a signature, the length of the Option ROM and an entry point for initialization code. If a valid Option ROM is located by the BIOS, the ROM's initialization code is invoked. Option ROMs replace or filter standard BIOS services by replacing the BIOS initialized interrupt vectors. There have been various techniques developed to map ROM into memory, including hardware mapping, copying to Upper Memory and to Shadow Memory. The objective is always to maintain a method that a common BIOS runtime can register and later on hand execution over to ever-expanding list of hardware without updaing BIOS for each change. BIOS & Option ROM The BIOS maintains an IPL Table listing all of the possible IPL sources. In the 1996 BBS Specification , boot devices are categorized into: BIOS Aware IPL Devices (BAID) : have all the code necessary to perform IPL resident in the system BIOS. BAID devices include floppy or fixed drives. Boot Connection Vector (BCV) devices: use Option ROM on associated device or in non-volatile storage on the motherboard. Bootstrap Entry Vector (BEV) devices: use Option ROM on associated device or in non-volativel storage on the motherboard. PXE is implemented as a BEV device !. The BIOS adds IPL devices to the BBS IPL Table already containing the BAIDs. These devices are identified during the BIOS Option ROM scan process. If the device hardware is detected and the rest of Option ROM initialization is successful (in other words, the Option ROM initialization code and loader code are placed in upper memory), control is returned to the BIOS indicating the Option ROM manages an IPL device. Within the ROM, a Plug and Play Expansion header will be present for each bootable device supported by the Option ROM. Each PnP Expansion header for a PXE IPL device will have a non-zero BEV. Once Option ROM scan is complete, the BIOS builds a list of bootable devices using the information obtained during the scan. According to the BBS , the priority list for these devices is established by the enduser through BIOS setup → thus, the boot order option! PXE Split ROM Architecture So BIOS can find PXE option by finding its Option ROM. Great. Since PXE is network dependent, how can it handles different networking hardware? Two techniques come into play: Split ROM architecture and UNDI . We will cover UNDI separately. Here, let's look at the split architecture. PXE Option ROM split architecture Prior to the PXE Spec , all PXE Option ROMs were implemented as a monolithic Option ROM with an option ROM header that encapsulates three components: PCI init & loader code NIC specific code (UNDI driver) Base code (BC) The PXE Split ROM Architecture specifies three different Option ROMs that work cooperatively to create a working PXE that supports one or more network interfaces. The three Option ROMs are: the Base-Code ROM (BC ROM): is common code to support one or more instances of the other ROMs. The BC ROM provides the protocol stack in addition to various loader and initialization code. A Base-Code ROM is required. the UNDI ROM: provides the network interface specific code. An UNDI ROM is specific to particular network interface hardware. UNDI provides a set of APIs that allow the remotely booted program to use universal protocol drivers. A system must contain at least one (but may contain several) UNDI ROMs, where each ROM would support one network interface. the BUSD ROM: provides bus support for CardBus-based network interface cards. BUSD is only required if supporting CardBus. Unlike the Base-Code and UNDI ROMs, BUSD's call mechanism must be added to the BIOS. Time to boot Now with all the basics out of the way, let's power on the computer! Page 77 in the PXE Spec has a nice diagram showing the details behind the scene from BIOS to a PXE: PXE IPL (from power on to PXE)","tags":"openstack","url":"https://fengxia41103.github.io/myblog/baremetal%20provisioning.html"},{"title":"Openstack Ironic","text":"This article is an outcome of my writing a Juju-Ironic provider. The plan was to first figure out Ironic APIs that will achieve what Juju provider needs — start an instance on demand, then build those REST requests into Juju provider code. After playing with Ironic API and Openstack's Devstack for two weeks, I start to realize that Ironic by itself doesn't do much. Instead, it heavily relies on other Openstack services to provision a baremetal — Keystone to generate a token which will be used in all HTTP calls, Neutron to provide network/ port , Ironic itself to manage a node , Glance to get kernel image, ramdisk image, and actual OS image, and Nova to orchestrate these information for Ironic API to consume. Ironic user guide has some good information on basic technology and Ironic design. A talk & slides by devananda on 2015 Vancouver Summit is also a good point to start. In the following sections I'd like to use the questions I have encountered in research to create a newbie-oriented tutorial on Ironic. In particular, I'd like to illustrate a few Ironic internals to show what \"managing baremetal\" is actually doing. Ironic introduction Ironic design ( source ) Ironic has three components: Ironic RESTful API Ironic conductor: its runtime core Ironic CLI ( python-ironicclient ) There are two other Ironic related projects that, though optional, should be included in our discussion also because they play an important role in Ironic's workflow: Ironic Python Agent and Ironic Inspector . Since it stores meta data in a DB, let's take a look at its DB schema: Ironic ER diagram Create a node = Enroll hardware API: POST v1/nodes Everything starts with creating a node. Ironic node is an abstract representation of a baremetal. Creating a node is simply adding certain node's parameters to Ironic DB. The term \"enrolling hardware\" (or enrolling a node) can be used interchangeably because it involves no image or system running on the node. Whether using Ironic Python Client to import JSON, or using CLI openstack baremetal node create , it achieves the same thing — eventually the command chain will call Ironic's API endpoint POST /v1/nodes . An example snippet to create node in Devstack is shown below. We will go over details of the input arguments in the next section. Note : you must specify the X-OpenStack-Ironic-API-Version value in HTTP header. def create_node ( token , chassis , driver_info , instance_info , properties ): # Ironic API: create a node url = 'http:// %s :6385/v1/nodes' % DEVSTACK_SERVER headers = { 'X-Auth-Token' : ' %s ' % token , 'Content-Type' : 'application/json' , 'Accept' : 'application/json' , 'X-OpenStack-Ironic-API-Version' : 1.9 # must have! } payload = { 'chassis_uuid' : chassis , \"driver\" : \"agent_ipmitool\" , \"name\" : randomword ( 5 ), \"driver_info\" : driver_info , 'instance_info' : instance_info , 'properties' : properties , } r = requests . post ( url , data = json . dumps ( payload ), headers = headers ) resp = json . loads ( r . content ) Node details API: GET v1/nodes/{node_ident} Unfortunately, Ironic's API document does not specify which field is required. You can create a node without giving it much information. Again, the creation does nothing besides creating a record in Ironic DB. Run openstack baremetal node show [node_uuid] displays details of a node. Details of a provisioned node name ( required ): well, a name. driver ( required ): we will discuss more about Ironic drivers. This defines which Ironic driver to use. driver_info ( required ): All the metadata required by the driver to manage this Node. List of fields varies between drivers, and can be retrieved from the /v1/drivers/ /properties resource. For example, for _ipmi drivers, one needs: ipmi_port ipmi_username in devstack, default to \"admin\" ipmi_password : in devstack, default to \"password\" ipmi_address : deploy_kernel : in devstack, it is \"ir-deploy-agent_ipmitool.kernel\". deploy_ramdisk : in devstack, it is \"ir-deploy-agent_ipmitool.initramfs\" Example payload: ``` shell driver_info = { 'ipmi_port' : 6230 , 'ipmi_username' : \"admin\" , 'deploy_kernel' : ir - deploy - agent_ipmitool . kernel UUID , 'deploy_ramdisk' : ir - deploy - agent_ipmitool . initramfs UUID , 'ipmi_address' : \"10.0.2.15\" , 'ipmi_password' : \"password\" } ``` driver_internal_info (read-only): this field is not accessible via API. Used by driver to store internal information. agent_url : this is the callback URL to the Ironic Python Agent (IPA) running on the node (when an agent ramdisk image is selected). We will cover more of IPA later. The value is filled in when the IPA calls Ironic's /v1/heartbeat endpoint. instance_info : is populated when the node is provisioned. However, user can also set this field through API. Example payload: ``` shell { \"ramdisk\" : \"1a243f7b-3e96-4140-8408-b82064599cec\" , \"kernel\" : \"ef538456-704c-445c-a98b-c081be22ad71\" , \"image_source\" : \"9794e5b3-b3f1-403c-b37a-19c7e07cca4a\" , \"ephemeral_gb\" : 0 , \"image_properties\" :{ \"kernel_id\" : \"ef538456-704c-445c-a98b-c081be22ad71\" , \"ramdisk_id\" : \"1a243f7b-3e96-4140-8408-b82064599cec\" , \"virtual_size\" : null }, \"preserve_ephemeral\" : false , \"ephemeral_mb\" : 0 , \"local_gb\" : \"10\" , \"image_disk_format\" : \"ami\" , \"image_checksum\" : \"eb9139e4942121f22bbc2afc0400b2a4\" , \"nova_host_id\" : \"devstack\" , \"ephemeral_format\" : null , \"root_gb\" : \"10\" , \"display_name\" : \"tt1\" , \"configdrive\" : null , \"image_type\" : \"partition\" , \"image_tags\" :[ ], \"memory_mb\" : \"1280\" , \"vcpus\" : \"1\" , \"image_url\" : \"http://10.0.2.15:8080/v1/AUTH_dbace9b9b039429ab5c2c3e43817ced2/glance/9794e5b3-b3f1-403c-b37a-19c7e07cca4a?temp_url_sig=da4154125d9011e2768bd5591b4d93c217f27d8b&temp_url_expires=1488585783\" , \"image_container_format\" : \"ami\" , \"root_mb\" : 10240 , \"swap_mb\" : 0 } ``` properties ( required ): Physical characteristics of this Node. Populated by ironic-inspector during inspection. Can also be set via the REST API at any time. These values are used by NOVA to match flavor — an important aspect of baremetal management is to filter what a workload wants vs. what we have, and the values in properties define what we have. Example payload: ```shell properties = { 'cpus': 1, 'memory_mb': 1280, 'local_gb': 10, 'cpu_arch': 'x86_64', 'capabilities': 'memory_mb:1280,local_gb:10,cpu_arch:x86_64,cpus:1,boot_option:local' } ``` The rest of the fields are self-explanatory so I'll skip them for now. Hardware inventory Hardware inventory is to collect characteristics such as the number of CPUs, memory size, disk partition, MAC address and so on. There are two ways to collect these: out-of-band and in-band. In-band inspection involves booting an OS on the target node and fetching information directly from it. This process is more fragile and time-consuming than the out-of-band inspection, but it is not vendor-specific and works across a wide range of hardware.; out-of-band, on the other hand, does not involve an OS. Instead, information is collected by a built-in BMC controllera on the baremetal box and are then queried through the box's IPMI interface. So translate these into Ironic, it has two ways to inventory hardware: IPA's hardware manager — in-band only. IPA is a Python client packaged inside a ramdisk that will be run at the beginning of a provisioning process. Hardware manager is part of IPA's capability. They can run together with IPA to collect node information. Ironic Inspector — in-band and out-of-band. Inspector is a separate service running outside the target node. It exposes a set of API . When caller sends request to its endpoint POST /v1/introspection/<node_indent> , inspector uses the UUID to extract node's drive_info from Ironic DB. With the IPMI credentials it can now query node info from BMC as well controlling its power cycle if it chooses to run a ramdisk as in-band method . Image [TBD] Two types of images: deploy image and user image. Plenty blogs showing how to make them. But I'd like to have an explanation what they are and how they are used.

The agent-based deploy method came from Rackspace and was [blueprinted]. Ironic Agent (IPA) Agent method means to boot a specially made ramdisk image on baremetal. Agent will run as systemd service. The magic is that agent knows where the Ironic API is. So it will lookup itself by sending Ironic API its MAC address. Ironic will send back the node UUID. From that point on, IPA will ping home (hearbeat) periodically (using UUID) until Ironic commands it to do something. Part of the hearbeat payload is a callback URL, so apparently IPA also exposes a HTTP service that Ironic conductor can use for commands. Ironic Python Agent (IPA) sequence diagram Quoting from the Rackspace OnMetal blog : With IPA the DHCP, PXE and TFTP configurations become the static for all baremetal nodes, reducing complexity. Once running, the Agent sends a heartbeat to the Ironic Conductors with hardware information. Then the Conductors can order the Agent to take different actions. For example in the case of provisioning an instance, the Conductor sends an HTTP POST to prepare_image with the URL for an Image, and the Agent downloads and writes it to disk itself, keeping the Ironic Conductor out of the data plane for an image download. Once the image is written to disk, the Ironic Conductor simply reboots the baremetal node, and it boots from disk, removing a runtime dependency on a DHCP or TFTP server. Provision process — Agent Source by devananda github . Ironic deploy — Agent The IPA server is implemented using Python Pecan . The long-running process is IronicPythonAgent in ironic_python_agent/agent.py : wsgi = simple_server . make_server ( self . listen_address . hostname , self . listen_address . port , self . api , server_class = simple_server . WSGIServer ) if not self . standalone and self . api_url : # Don't start heartbeating until the server is listening self . heartbeater . start () try : wsgi . serve_forever () except BaseException : LOG . exception ( 'shutting down' ) if not self . standalone and self . api_url : self . heartbeater . stop () The heartbeater.start() is a thread that expects to receive letter 'a' from Ironic and will stop upon receiving 'b' . IPA also implements a RPC using the below syntax: @base . async_command ( 'prepare_image' , _validate_image_info ) def prepare_image ( self , image_info = None , configdrive = None ): The function prepare_image is the key. Ironic's xx-Agent driver will call POST to IPA's endpoint using the string prepare_image as a RPC call that will envoke the corresponding function on the IPA side, in this case, the function prepare_image , which is to write image to disk. The IPA implementation of this function is shown below. As one can see, it is assuming that a block device is available and it will then run a bash script to write this image to disk. After image is written to disk, it can also write a bootloader (eg. grub2). Then IPA will signal Ironic that deploy is all done, and Ironic will go ahead to reboot the node — this then completes the provisioning process. @base . async_command ( 'prepare_image' , _validate_image_info ) def prepare_image ( self , image_info = None , configdrive = None ): \"\"\"Asynchronously prepares specified image on local OS install device.

It promises a selection of blueprints that hold magic to make an application deployment easy. But devils are in the details, as always the case. In this article we will walk in the charm world to learn its design. Bundle, charm, service, application Juju terms can be confusing. Approximately they can be viewed in a tree model, where a bundle can have multiple charms, a charm can contain multiple services , a service is composed of one or more applications and a group of relations , and a relation, if defined, must be one of the two types: provide (eg. I am MySQL and I provide a SQL database relation). require (eg. I'm Mediawiki and I require a SQL database). Juju control modeling In term of deployment, a service can be deployed to more than one machine so as to achieve HA; a machine can also have more than one services. Here we use the term machine broadly because it can also be a single LXD container, so in this case there can be many containers in a single VM, and many VMs on a single physical machine . Charm and layers How does a charm describe an application and its relations then? The anwser is: layers . A charm is built from three layers: basic/runtime layer , interface layer , and charm layer. Basic layer is like a library — common parts that many applications can use without conflicts. Thing like DB services, HTTP server, storage should belong to this category. Interface layer is an abstract of what a charm exposes for consumption. Case in point will be any database charm, who should always define an interface to exchange DB login credentials and ports. Charm layer is application specific, and its logic is following the reactive pattern . Juju charm layers Hooks and Reactive pattern Previously, charms are written as a list of hooks responding to events. This is still true because hooks are the actual scripts. Any charm supports the following hooks: install config-changed start upgrade-charm stop update-status leader-elected leader-settings-changed For each relation defined, there are four relation hooks : [name]-relation-joined [name]-relation-changed [name]-relation-departed [name]-relation-broken Hooks run in a paritcular sequence, and that sequence is hardcoded . This is terrible. So instead of individual hooks, we have now a better way to capture this concept using States — reactive pattern . A charm can define arbitrary state, say foo . Another layer in the same charm can then uses Python decorator, eg. @when , @when_not , to specify the status of foo , which then determined whether the function will be executed. I suppose the framework itself handles event polling, broadcasting and the like. State has a namespace per charm per unit. Therefore, states do not go across unit boundary, nor charm boundary. For states between charms/units, use interface . Basic/runtime layer There are two ways to construct basic layer: use an existing one, such as the apache-php , or use the basic layer template to write your own. Don't forget to check out these existing runtime layers for reuse. Note : which one can be reused, and which one can not? I don't see any document to distinguish this. Interface layer Interface layer defines both the provides and the requires . One thing to remember is that relation does not define the actual connection at all! What it does is to pass along configurations — IP address, port, user name, password, and such. For example, if there is a MySQL provides and Wordpress requires , Wordpress will read from the providing side of configurations needed to make the connection. Charm relation and interface Communication scope Interfaces are categorized into three communication scopes : global level, service level, and unit level. Again, they are grouping concept, where unit is the atom (and the default level). Multiple units can belong to a service level, and everything else goes into global level. The communication scope is closely related to the relationship lifecycle , where units in the same scope will have data broadcasted to them so they will be aware of each other's state. Therefore, unit level can be used for application that provides no relation and has no peer-to-peer need; service level is certainly providing some type of relation so others can leverage; and global is just a catch-all scope. Relation and Interface So how does relation and interface come into play? Declaring relation is a strong statement. As we have already mentioned, there are two types of relations: provides and requires . The provides and requires keys defined in metadata.yaml are used to define pairings of charms that are likely to be fruitful. Consider mongodb's metadata: name: mongodb ... provides: database: interface: mongodb where in another metadata who is on the receiving end of this relation: name: my-node-app ... requires: database: interface: mongodb provides: website: interface: http The word database is the relation name. There is no restriction to it except it can not be juju or jujud . Relation name serves as a grouping because each relation can have more than one interface. The interface name, mongodb , is important, since it is being used to look up an existing relation registry for a match. I think this is how charm build can pull in dependencies of other charms/layers. Charm layer This is where the application logics live.

In the demo , we added this machine manually using juju add-machine command. Machine-0 recognizes the new node. CLI issues a deploy command. Charm gets deployed. This usecase, however, is somewhat backwards -- we have provisioned a machine prior to the deploy command. Wouldn't it be better if the command will signal the cloud provider to create a new machine on the fly? MAAS provider can almost do just that. MAAS way of a deploy We have briefly touched upon the MAAS way . By default, Juju deploy will request for a new machine unless using the --to [machine number] flag. While using MAAS it is seen that MAAS will turn a READY machine into ALLOCATED then DEPLOYING . Once a Juju agent is installed (provisioned), the agent executes application deployment. MAAS target node state diagram during Juju deploy process From CLI to provider We know machine-0 will call MAAS's REST API to kick off the machine provisioning process. But we do not know which API endpoint it is using, and who is the caller inside machine-0 that makes this call. Priviously we have analyzed this process from the outside — files generated, states changed, application installed. Here we will look into the code to understand how these steps take place. Overview of the agent While looking at this process, one can't help noticing the key role the juju agent plays. It seems to have intelligence that, once installed, knows how to speak to the state controller (machine-0), how to find and download a charm, and how to use it to deploy an application. So just how are agents wired together? High level view of Juju agents in an environment The key of this diagram is that the agents are connected in a client-server configuration, where machine-0's agent is the API server and all other agents are its clients. The API server provides a facade , a design pattern, which exposes functions for client to call. It is not clear yet how function is mapped to a string, eg. Deploy RPC will translate to facade's Deploy() function call.So Juju CLI is a client, same as a provisioned node. Machine-0, state, and provisioner Now when agent, say the CLI, issues a command, to the API server, what happens next? Juju's design maintains an internal state that are persisted in a mongo DB. A command will cause a state change, eg. if machine XYZ's current state is one that has no MySQL (state A), a deploy MySQL command will generate a state B (=state A + MySQL installed). This change is then saved to the DB. There is a background loop called provisioner , who monitors this state change. The change(set) essentially has all the information the provisioner needs to take an action so to bring machine from state A → state B. Machine-0 state & provisioner Provisioner and provider Ok, so the provisioner loop is the action taker. How is it aware of the cloud provider? This is the final piece of the puzzle — within the provisionTask struct, there is a environs.InstanceBroker . Now if you recall, the environs is another name for provider, where InstanceBroker is a provider interface! Bingo. type provisionerTask struct { controllerUUID string machineTag names.MachineTag machineGetter MachineGetter toolsFinder ToolsFinder machineChanges watcher.StringsChannel retryChanges watcher.NotifyChannel --> broker environs.InstanceBroker catacomb catacomb.Catacomb auth authentication.AuthenticationProvider imageStream string harvestMode config.HarvestMode harvestModeChan chan config.HarvestMode retryStartInstanceStrategy RetryStrategy // instance id -> instance instances map [ instance.Id ] instance.Instance // machine id -> machine machines map [ string ] *apiprovisioner.Machine } Call chain, and call to provider Back to our initial question then — how a CLI deploy command can kick off provider to create a new machine? The command chain is roughly like this: CLI will send a RPC request to API server (machine-0). RPC figures out what the next state needs to be. machine-0's agent write the change to DB. Provisioner detects a state change. Provisioner task calls environs.broker.StartInstance function to kick off a new machine. Mapping everything here into what's in the code, here is a illustration showing call chain from one module to the next. Some of them are just think wrapper of next function. The mapping between a command to a state is taking place in state.AddApplication() which I'm highlighting in green .

A new buffer will open w/ the list of files that contains a match. In that buffer, press t to select all (press t again will toggle it off). Press Q (capital). Query replace regexp in marked files... : set the old string with: : set new string If you skip these two steps, it will use the default (the previous replacement). 8. A buffer will open showing the line that can be replaced: y : replace it n : skip Y : replace all w/ YES → and watch the mini buffer showing \"x occurance\" flashing so you know replacement is happening. q : quit C-x s , then ! to save all buffers. I find that the easiest way to revert a mistake is to git checkout -f , then start this exercise from beginning.

In this article, we will continue our research into another important function — juju deploy. Deploy will command a node to pull down requested charm and install whatever needed based the charm's instruction. As the bootstrap research, I'm interested in the internal mechanism of this process, the bare minimum to simulate a successful run, and the minimum steps to repeat this for development and troubleshooting. Screencast See the process in action: Screencast of juju deploying Jenkins Juju + MAAS We have already covered state machine of MAAS target node . In the context of deploying a charm driven by Juju, we can take a look MAAS internals how those states are related. MAAS target node state diagram during Juju deploy process Deploy steps illustrated This is a more detailed view of juju deploying a charm broken down into three steps. Illustration of a Juju cloud environment before a deployment In this environment, we have a CLI controller where we will type in juju commands, one state controller who manages the cloud, and one machine running Mysql. The objective is to deploy a Jenkins charm to a new machine (in green ) we have just provisioned. Broadly speaking, events of a juju deploy take four steps to get the job done: Add the new machine to juju's environment. A juju agent (aka. jujud) will be installed. More details are discussed in the next section. ``` shell $ juju add - machine ssh : //[username]@192.168.8.235 ``` Juju state controller (aka. machine-0) will recoganize the new machine and register its availability. Issuing a deploy command ```shell $ juju deploy jenkinsn ``` Jujud will download Jenkins charm and execute per its instruction. Issuing command to deploy Jenkins The result, as expected, is that we have now two machines in the cloud, each equipped with an application, and both have a jujud installed. Deployment result What takes to be a good machine In our previous example, we used add-machine command to bring new machine into the juju environment. As it turned out, one can add any provisioned machine into the cloud (as long as it knows how to install juju agent which is another topic). Now let's take a look what installing an agent will do to this machine. First We created a vanilla Xenial 16.04 server with certainly no knowledge of juju. The only user account is under whateverusername . We intentionally avoided using ubuntu as user because we know the bootstrap was relying on such an account. Will juju complain of its missing? Let's find out. $ juju add-machine ssh:// [ username ] @192.168.8.235 What is interesting is to watch the node and figure out what is installed by this command. /var/lib/juju This is the home folder for juju — /var/lib/juju . Remember, this folder did not exist prior to the add-machine command. /var/lib/juju ├── agents │ └── machine-15 │ └── agent.conf ├── init │ └── jujud-machine-15 │ ├── exec-start.sh │ └── jujud-machine-15.service ├── locks └── tools ├── 2 .0.1.98-xenial-amd64 │ ├── downloaded-tools.txt │ ├── FORCE-VERSION │ └── jujud └── machine-15 -> 2 .0.1.98-xenial-amd64 8 directories, 6 files Pretty minimum. It designated a machine serial number — 15. This magic number is apparently assigned by machine-0 because only it knows the next index (this index is ever incremental). However, this index is troublesome also because folders and files are created using this index, and we have already seen system files are symbolic links to them. So the challenge is to simulate this configuration process as if it were done by juju. It is doable (copy files, create folders and so forth), but will be tedious. /etc /etc/apt/apt.conf.d/42-juju-proxy-settings /etc/profile.d/juju-introspection.sh /etc/sudoers.d/90-juju-ubuntu /etc/systemd/system/jujud-machine-15.service /etc/systemd/system/multi-user.target.wants/jujud-machine-15.service root@192-168-8-235:~# ls -lh /etc/systemd/system | grep juju lrwxrwxrwx 1 root root 60 Jan 19 16 :47 jujud-machine-15.service -> /var/lib/juju/init/jujud-machine-15/jujud-machine-15.service You can use the common service juju-machine-15 start|stop|restart|status to manage this service like any others. /usr/bin Two binaries appeared, both linked (again) to some files under the /var/lib/juju/ folder. /usr/bin/juju-dumplogs /usr/bin/juju-run root@192-168-8-235:~# ls -lh /usr/bin | grep juju lrwxrwxrwx 1 root root 36 Jan 19 16 :47 juju-dumplogs -> /var/lib/juju/tools/machine-15/jujud lrwxrwxrwx 1 root root 36 Jan 19 16 :47 juju-run -> /var/lib/juju/tools/machine-15/jujud /usr/share /usr/share/sosreport/sos/plugins/juju.py /usr/share/sosreport/sos/plugins/ \\_\\_ pycache \\_\\_ /juju.cpython-35.pyc /home/ubuntu So juju's agent install process actually created a user ubuntu which did not exist before.

Let's pick something light (for example, an application which will request only one node) to try.

very first command user will encounter is the juju bootstrap . It createa a special machine — state controller, machine-0 , control node, etc. — naming convention aside, it is the brain that tracks others nodes in the cloud, applications installed and their status. Screencast Through research I want to learn about its process, internal mechanism, how this command triggers off other juju components, what is the minimum take to simulate a successful bootstrap, and if things go south, what is the minimum to simulate a clean state so we can run juju bootstrap again as if from scratch. This last point is particuarly useful for development and troubleshooting. Screencast of juju bootstraping a cloud environment First thing first, if we have create a cloud or are using a stock cloud type: $ juju bootstrap [ cloudname ] [ machine-0 name ] for example: $ juju bootstrap devx test-1 This will create a state controller (machine-0) that will be the management node within juju's cloud environment. Develop a new provider Case in point is to develop a new provider. Juju's document is helpful to guide development provides that one is familiar with code base and the rest of the Juju environment. The article fill in gap between a design document and code itself so not only one defines these interfaces, methods and so on, but one understands when these methods will be called, how they are called, and what they are to achieve. Juju cloud & provider Canonical Juju is a powerful orchestration tool. Its power lies in deploying some applications by sending a form of request to underline cloud and have the cloud figuring out what type of machine should be provisioned, putting an OS on it, installing necessary tools and application, and finally putting the desired applications on top. It's magic. Being able to handle multiple types of cloud, Juju abstracs a cloud with an envrionment (we will use \"cloud\" and \"environment\" interchangeably in this article). Within an environment, there is a special machine, the machine-0 , that functions as a management node to all other machines. In essence it is a state controller where configurations of all slave nodes, status of deployed applications and so on are kept. The cloud provider is the driver layer where Juju's CLI speaks to a cloud. Each cloud has a different API. Juju provides a common bootstrap framework to tie these providers into a common process. Juju cloud abstraction Bootstrap usage Before Juju bootstraps an environment, it needs to know to have basic knowledge of clouds . Off the shelf Juju supports the followings: Azure Cloudsigma Amazon EC2 GCE Joyent Openstack Rackspace Vsphere Canonical MAAS LXD containers Manual For the above, nearly everything is built-in(!) The bare minimum to bootstrap a machine is user credential (and some cloud, eg. LXD, doesn't use credentials). Juju handles everything else. Depending on the selected cloud type, Juju commands also offer different configurations that can be customized, for example, direct request to a particular EC2 region. LXD is a special type of cloud because it does not involve another machine throughout — everything is taking place on the same machine where CLI are being issued. For all others, it always involves some kind of remote API interface for commanding purpose. To list all supported cloud types: $ juju list-clouds fengxia@ubuntu:~$ ./juju list-clouds Cloud Regions Default Type Description aws 12 us-east-1 ec2 Amazon Web Services aws-china 1 cn-north-1 ec2 Amazon China aws-gov 1 us-gov-west-1 ec2 Amazon ( USA Government ) azure 18 centralus azure Microsoft Azure azure-china 2 chinaeast azure Microsoft Azure China cloudsigma 5 hnl cloudsigma CloudSigma Cloud google 4 us-east1 gce Google Cloud Platform joyent 6 eu-ams-1 joyent Joyent Cloud rackspace 6 dfw rackspace Rackspace Cloud localhost 1 localhost lxd LXD Container Hypervisor devmaas 0 maas Metal As A Service devx 0 xclarity Lenovo XClarity To bootstrap an environment is simple if everything has been setup correctly. It is really up to the underline cloud to provide a machine, and this is where we are going to analye in further details. $ juju bootstrap [ cloud type ][ any name ] Bootstrap overview Juju offers a generalized framework into which code that drives a cloud type is tied. Being the first machine to create in a given environment, machine-0 involves tremendous amount of machinary to go live. In a nutshell, all activities can be categorized into the followings: Juju bootstrap framework Setup constraints: An umbrella term containing anything from memory size to region to the version of OS itself. Pick OS image: For Ubuntu, it does mapping from a name, eg. Precise, to an actual OS version. Pick agent/tools: Juju requires to install an agent, jujud , on all slave nodes. Bootstrap will abort if no adequate agent can be located. Chaning version number to a non-official one, eg. 2.0.1.99, will force Juju binary to use a local jujud (compiled). Provision OS: Machine is setup for SSH access via public-key (including root). A default user, ubuntu , is created on the machine. Set up instance configuration: An instance configuration controls all things beyond a bare OS, such as triggering an OS update & upgrade (eg. apt upgrade), ports Juju agent should listen to, networking configurations, etc.. Configure node: From the main controller, Juju will SSH into the node, install Juju agent and tools, set up a mongoDB for data persistence and running other chores using cloud-init. Default Juju agent path: /var/lib/juju Bootstrap framework With the overview in mind, let's take a look Juju's actual bootstrap process located in juju.juju.environs.Bootstrap function. Gray boxes: depicts data inputs to each functional block, and details of data structures. Green boxes: are integration points with different cloud providers — how to start an instance from scratch (provisioning), and how to configure an OS-ed machine. The latter can be argued cloud agnostic. However, it is heavily geared towards Ubuntu environment by default. Blue : are clearly Canonical dependent due to hard-coded values (eg. simplestream URL). Juju bootstrap framework The purpose of this framework is to pre-evaluate constraints and requested resources for provider's consumption. For example, it will cponstruct a list of Juju agents and tools but delay its final picking until providre's code is called. Same for OS images (imageMetadata). The Juju tools & agent play such a key role in bootstraping that the entire process will abort if no matching tool is located. The assumption is that privisioning OS is the job the cloud and Juju is responsible for actions from OS onward. So if there is no tools to take the machine to the next stage, why bother installing an OS? Now let's drive into a provider's arena and take a look what a provider offers. Illustration of a \"common\" provider Juju's common provider serves as an example for study. It can looked as a standard way to provision and configure a node. As a matter of fact, some providers uses its Bootstrap function completly. \"common\" provisioning & cloud integration If framework has done preliminary sanity checks and collected possible resources, provider's task is to make a final pick. Thing like selecting the OS image and juju agent and tools are all taking place here. Once ducks are in line, call a provider's BootstrapInstance function ← and this is the point where underline cloud meets Juju. \"common\" provider's BootstrapInstance function What is expected from the cloud? Four things that are all hardware centric: hardware characteristics: architecture, memory size, root disk size, CPU cores. network information storage volume storage volume attachment // StartInstanceResult holds the result of an // InstanceBroker.StartInstance method call. type StartInstanceResult struct { // Instance is an interface representing a cloud instance. Instance instance.Instance // Config holds the environment config to be used for any further // operations, if the instance is for a controller. Config *config.Config // HardwareCharacteristics represents the hardware characteristics // of the newly created instance.

ReadOnly bool } \"common\" node configuring In code this step is presented as an \"interface\" function within the BootstrapInstance . So it is really part of the provisioning calls. However, we are separating it here for discussion purpose. \"common\" provider's BootstrapInstance finalizer function The most critical thing in this step is to install Juju agent. We will write more about this agent in other articles. For bootstrap, the followings are observed: default path: /var/lib/juju hardcoded log file name: cloud-init-output.log nonce content (see below) nonce Juju identifies machine-0 by SSH-ing into the machine and matching /var/lib/juju/nonce.txt content to a special string: user-admin:bootstrap . Machine-0 must have file ( /var/lib/juju/nonce.txt ) with content: user-admin:bootstrap Wrapup This concludes our humble attempt to decipher Juju's bootstrap mechanisms. We have covered quite some grounds. The key take away is to understand where provider is expected. However, this is an over simplified view because it also depends on how much involvement a cloud want to have in this process. Argubly one can say that cloud provider is really called for in each of the six steps in this process — it needs to validate constraints, it should pick the OS image, it certainly should control the tool and cloud-init process, and certainly it is doing the provisioning. I think this argument is nearly true if one looks into stock providers and pull all their implementation together. For writing a new provider, XClarity, it comes down to a design decision then how much the underline cloud wants control. The bare minimum (as we have done in the simulation, see below) is to rely on default values, common provider's Bootstrap functions, and return a StartInstanceResult . // For now, we are imitating a successful instance by directly returning a result struct var tmpArch string = arch.AMD64 var tmpMem uint64 = 2000000 var tmpCpuCore uint64 = 1 var tmpCpuPower uint64 = 100 hardware : = instance.HardwareCharacteristics { Arch: & tmpArch, Mem: & tmpMem, CpuCores: & tmpCpuCore, CpuPower: & tmpCpuPower, } volumes : = make ([] storage.Volume, 0 ) networkInfo : = make ([] network.InterfaceInfo, 0 ) volumeAttachments : = make ([] storage.VolumeAttachment, 0 ) return & environs.StartInstanceResult { Instance: xclarityBootstrapInstance {} , Config: env.ecfg.Config, Hardware: & hardware, // type instance.HardwareCharacteristics struct NetworkInfo: networkInfo, // type network.InterfaceInfo struct Volumes: volumes, // type storage.Volume struct VolumeAttachments: volumeAttachments, // type storageVolumeAttachment struct } , nil There are a few topics that are not covered in this article, but need to be studied further: Juju agent & tools: What does an agent do? What is the DB look like? How is information registered with jujud (aka. agent)? How does agent communicates with CLI controller? Why is it an issue to match agent with juju binary? How to build a custom agent? cloud-init: My understanding at the moment is that the entire node configuration is done via cloud-init . Itself is not interesting. But what Juju does to make cloud-init carry out its task is interesting. I think there are scripts involved. So who is generating these scripts? what type of scripts? Can they be customized? This helps us to know how much we can control the final state of an instance. SimpleStream: I think it is a form of communication protocol. It is how one communicates with jujud. What capability does it have? Who is providing that in Juju's environment? How it may be affected by other network design/configuration? Well, stay tuned.","tags":"openstack","url":"https://fengxia41103.github.io/myblog/juju%20bootstrap.html"},{"title":"Juju charm  model","text":"This article is a high level view of Juju's internal modelings. For me it was fairly confusing when looking at its document which has an army of these concepts: charm, bundle, model, unit.... of course, each of them makes sense after a while. Its terminology page helps on understanding individual term. But like other Canonical documents, it needs a design level diagram to help user grasp the structure of this wealth of knowledge. So here it is my attemp to show the relationship between these terms. Instead of drawing a tree to reflect 1-N relationship, I used an outer enclosure which can have multiple of its inner enclosures, eg. a bundle can have N charms. Juju control models A few interesting points besides the 1-N relationships. A single application can be deployed on multiple machines, eg. Application #2 has two units. This is how one application can be scaled out horizontally. One machine, in turn, can host multiple applications, eg. one unit of application #2 and #3 both live on the same machine. By default, juju deploy will call for a new machine for each application within the bundle/charm. Of course, there is command flag to switch that so you can specify which machine is to be used.","tags":"openstack","url":"https://fengxia41103.github.io/myblog/juju%20charm%20model.html"},{"title":"Targets in MAAS lab","text":"After setting up the MAAS server and its subnet, bringing up a target node is simple. All nodes must be on the same 192.168.8.0/24 subnet, and they must support PXE boot. PXE boot The MAAS machine functions as both the DHCP server and the TFTP server, both are required to facilitate PXE booting. First, we creat a blank VM. The important things are: Under System → Mother board → Boot order , check the Network . However, it is not necessary to move the Network boot above Hard Disk . When there is no OS deployed yet on the hard disk, boot process will fall through to PXE anyway. Once an OS has been installed, the machine will boot normally from HD. If you put PXE as the first order, this target will not boot into HD image at all. Set Network → Adapter 1 → Internal Network , named intnet . This corresponds to the MAAS managed subnet of 192.168.8.0/24. After this, start the target VM and it should PXE boot and will shut itself down at the end of the boot. MAAS machine life cycle MAAS target goes through a life cycel as shown below: MAAS target node life cycle New Once PXE booted, the MAAS server will automatically enlist this machine with a New status. This indicates that machine has been discovered by MAAS. The given node name is completly arbitrary, and it has nothing to do with VM's name. If there are multiple targets, the only way to match MAAS node name with a VM is through assigned IP addresses. Commission This is the phase in which MAAS server tries to determine the CPU, memory, and disk information of the target. Two important configurations to notice: Power type: for our virtual lab, select Manual . Otherwise, the admin GUI will block you from commissioning completly. Retain : do NOT check such checkboxes. The word retain means to keep what you have. Therefore, it will skip registering the target's disk information. This is super confusing because commission output details will show clearly the disk info. So the commission scripts run just fine and pulled everything correctly. It's the MAAS logic to ignore these returned values if user has checked retain . READY If commissioning went through, MAAS server will now has all the information needed to deploy something to this target. Think of machines in this state as a pool from which deployment can pick. Deploy By far, target machine has nothing on it — it has a blank disk. First thing first, we need to put an OS on it, and that's deploy is about. Take action → Deploy, and reboot target which should come up in PXE again. MAAS admin will automatically change node's status to Deploying . OS will be written to disk. Once state switched to Deployed , verify by: Goto Subnet menu on MAAS web admin UI, look up the target's assigned IP address. Boot up target machine ← it will now load from HD instead of PXE! ``` shell ssh ubuntu @192.168.8 . xxx ``` Since deployed image has copied the SSH public key that we have created in steps of creating the MAAS server itself and have copied to the MAAS admin UI, you can now SSH to any deployed target without having a password. Release Releasing a deployed target gives an option to erase disk. Again, taget has to be PXE-booted in order to be managed by the MAAS server. MAAS sever can not manage a deployed target unless it PXE boots. If released and disk erased, the node becomes READY , again.","tags":"openstack","url":"https://fengxia41103.github.io/myblog/maas%20target.html"},{"title":"Setup a MAAS Virtualbox lab","text":"Canonical MAAS is a deployment tool that can give a bare metal life by putting an OS on it. Working together with Juju , they can setup a cluster of applications quite quickly. Think of them as a package manage like Ubuntu's apt-get , but in the context of a cloud. Interesting. This article shows how to setup a virtual lab so one can play with these two tools and get a sense of what they do. The whole setup is based on Virtualbox. One thing I found out the hard way is that despite their nice looking website and rather recent project history, there is no single document that can bring this environment live from A to Z. All official documents have out-of-date commands here and there which made following them useless. I consulted countless blogs, posts, chasing down bugs (or I thought they were bugs), and finally when everything works, it became so obvious and simple. Hopefully this article will shorten this journey for readers and they can have this environment easily. Baseline environment Virtualbox 5.1.10 and its extension pack . I could not verify why this particular version worked. I had 5.1.8 and the first successful trial occurred after I upgraded to 5.1.10. Was that a coincidence? Without being able to reproduce this, I am merely documenting what I have. Network topology Getting network configurations right is the key for success. The biggest gotcha is that MAAS server must be the DHCP server on its managing subnet! The official document talks about \"if there is an existing DHCP, points it to the MAAS server\", huh? I never figured that out, so don't listen to that. There will be two VMs and one internal network, intnet1 . VM #1 : is the MAAS server. Use Xenial 16.04 desktop image. VM #2 : is an emulated BM. intnet1 : is a subnet (192.168.8.0/24) that MAAS server will live together with its managed nodes (I call them targets). MAAS Virtualbox lab networking topology Setup instructions Personally I dislike those step-by-step instructions because first of all, it is intimidating; secondly, each environment is a bit different, so how confident user will feel to duplicate other's success? Not much. I'll explain thoughts and lessons learned along the way. I think that is more useful even from the point that Google may pick up a few words here and will help others if they search. Install MAAS server, admin account, subnet MAAS server uses Ubuntu 16.04 Xenial image. Setup the networking to have two interfaces — one uses default NAT so you have internet access, while the other uses Internal Network with name intnet1 . Defining the subnet managed by MAAS server is the most imporant step in MAAS configuration. Config subnet intnet1 . Define it as 192.168.8.x (This is completly arbitrary. Use whatever network range you want to use). Use ifconfig to find out interface name that corresponds to intnet1 (a clue: the one that has no IP assigned): ``` shell $ nano / etc / network / interfaces auto enp0s9 iface enp0s9 inet static address 192.168.8.1 netmask 255.255.255.0 gateway 192.168.8.1 # this will be setup in MAAS as default gateway ! ``` At Virtualbox level we have added an interface to this VM using Internal Network , we need then define this network in VM. Also, defining this before installing MAAS will have MAAS installer pick up this subnet automatically so to save some manual work down the road. Install MAAS is simple. Don't bother with other methods. ```shell sudo add-apt-repository ppa:maas/stable sudo apt update sudo apt install maas ``` Create MAAS admin: ```shell sudo maas createadmin ``` Create SSH key and copy content from ~/.ssh/id_rsa.pub : ```shell mkdir .ssh ssh-keygen -t rsa less ~/.ssh/id_rsa.pub ``` Login in http://localhost:5240/MAAS using admin created in step 3, goto user preference (click user name ). select upload and paste step 4's content into the text box. This is the public key that will be copied to each MAAS target at deployment so later you can SSH into these targets without knowing the password. MAAS upload SSH key Setup MAAS gateway. This was actually asked when installing MAAS server. But I missed this and ended up spending 5 days debugging a strange issue where provisioned node can not ping outside world. In short, set MAAS default gateway to be the IP of the MAAS server, in our case, 192.168.8.1 ! MAAS default gateway At this point, the MAAS server is installed and user can login the web admin console. Next, setup firewall rules on MAAS server so it can be the router for managed subnet. MAAS server firewall rules Install UFW . UFW is infinitely easier to use than iptables. Making the MAAS server as a router is necessary because targets, once acquired an OS, will need internet access in order to APT other things. (If using real metal server, the server can be connected to multiple VLANs among which one is providing internet access.) Masquerading Following the instructions to enable default port forwarding: Packet forwarding needs to be enabled in ufw. Two configuration files will need to be adjusted, in /etc/default/ufw change the DEFAULT_FORWARD_POLICY to ACCEPT : ```shell DEFAULT_FORWARD_POLICY=\"ACCEPT\" ``` Then edit /etc/ufw/sysctl.conf and uncomment: ```shell net/ipv4/ip_forward=1 net/ipv6/conf/default/forwarding=1 ``` Firewall policies Enabling UFW will deny all access (except the current ssh session). So before anything, allow port 22! To config MAAS server to route 192.168.8.x subnet traffic to internet using UFW is simple. Using ifconfig to find the interface name that is connected to the internet(NAT), in this example, enp0s3 : ```shell nano /etc/ufw/before.rules ``` Paste this at the bottom of the file, after the COMMIT that has already been in that document: ```shell # nat Table rules *nat :POSTROUTING ACCEPT [0:0] -A POSTROUTING -s 192.168.8.0/24 -o enp0s3 -j MASQUERADE COMMIT ``` What this does is to make enp0s3 as the router for subnet 192.168.8.x ← welcome the internet! Ports UFW will erect a firewall that blocks everything by default! We have poked holes for port 22 to allow SSH. More need to be done: Allow http 80: ufw allow http Allow ping: ufw allow 53 Allow region controller API port: 5240 Allow Bootp server and client: 67, 68 Allow Img service: 5248 Allow tftp: 69, 5244 Allow domain service: 5246 Allow rndc service: 5247 Allow iscsi: 3260 Allow ntp: 123 Allow MAAS bootstrap sever: 8000 Finally, sudo ufw enable . Our GFW is up. MAAS as DHCP server As I have mentioned, the MAAS server node must be the DHCP server on subnet 192.168.8.x. No exception! MAAS admin web is the tool to use for this configuration. Login into http://192.168.8.1/MAAS/ , goto Subnets and select the VLAN ← this is how you can turn on DHCP on a subnet: MAAS DHCP config Click Vlan column on 192.168.8.0/24 subnet row to get to the Vlan configuration page. Take action to enable DHCP. Change the gateway to 192.168.8.1, which is this server's static IP on this subnet. MAAS admin DHCP config We have done the hard part — setting up the MAAS server. In our next article , I'll show you what MAAS can do for fun → brining up a bare metal machine to life. Stay tuned.","tags":"openstack","url":"https://fengxia41103.github.io/myblog/maas%20virtualbox.html"},{"title":"SPA: World Snapshot","text":"World Snapshot live demo , and github The joy of making graphs in a data-driven web application has been the highlight that kept me going from project to project.

After putting together an Excel to model the car leasing process, I started to think how to make the lesson learned available for other buyers. Also, I figure this is a perfect candidate for a single page application (SPA). Two versions have been created — one in Angular , and another in REACT . This ties to my belief that however wonderful a tool may be, it is also important how well it fits your way of thinking and typing . So this project gives a case to evaluate which one I'd like to invest into for more development. Leasing deciphered Sad reality is, all the leverages one can pull in a car leasing deal have been made intentionally complicated so to confuse buyers. Jargon are everywhere, and everything is connected so one number changed seems to be changing everything, and some changes are more significant than others. How could one to figure out which is which!? I know there are many car leasing tutorials, blogs, articles and so on. But here I want to present a different approach. First of all, let's turn those maths into diagram: How do you get a monthly payment Now it's obvious, two numbers are the key because they determine monthly payment: Financing cost: How much you are borrowing from bank? This is determined by how much you can negotiate down the price, how much deduction you can get, eg. down payment, rebates, trade-ins, credits. The rest will be the money you owe → borrowing (or in a fancy term, financing). Depreciation cost: How much your lease will cost to the car to be worth less than a new one. This is the actual car that you are really paying for. Two numbers are the key: financing cost and depreciation cost Financing cost then links APR (interest rate) because this is the amount buyer is borrowing from a financing lender, either a bank or the dealer itself. First of all, there is mathematical standard to compute this. You need a computer or a calculator for this because this is not linear math. Second, believe or not, the effect of interest rate is not as significant as one thinks, and I'll show you why. On the other hand, watch out for depreciation cost because it is a disaster. There is no standard whatsoever. The best reference is a residue rate derived from official flyer posted on manufacturer's website. But then there can be all kinds of excuses to void that. Basically each dealer can make up their own rules. Terrible. This is exactly the advantage dealer has over buyers. Depreciation cost is easy to calculate. For a $20,000 car, 10% decrease in residue rate will generate $2,000 more cash for the dealer. Spreading that out to 36-month term, it's a $56 more payment per month. So when leasing, make sure to use this tool to figure out what the residue rate the dealer's offer is implying. If it's too far off from the official flyer number, walk away! Math This is an example by Edmunds . See if you can follow the math now after reading the diagram above. Now by looking at this, I'm wondering maybe I should have built using this format. It is more form-like than a SPA so this can be easier for user to follow: 1. Sticker Price of the car + options $23,000 2. Times the residual value percentage X 57% 3. Equals the residual value = $13,110 4. Invoice price of car minus incentives (net capitalized cost) $20,000 5. Minus the residual (from line 3) - $13,110 6. Equals the depreciation over 36 months = $6,890 7. Depreciation (line 6) divided by term in months ÷ 36 8. Equals the monthly depreciation payment = $191 9. Net capitalized cost (From line 4) $20,000 10. Plus the residual (From line 3) + $13,110 11. Equals = $33,110 12. Times the money factor X 0.00125 (3 percent) 13. Equals money factor (interest) payment portion = $41 14. Monthly depreciation payment (from line 8) $191 15. Plus money factor payment portion (from line 12) + $41 16. Equals bottom-line monthly lease payment = $232 AngularJS First version was created in Angular . In particular, I was interested in its component . It has been quite interesting to make this page design based on component architecture. Component encapsulates logic and view rendering into one piece. The HTML templating capability has saved a lot of typings as well as making changing any component a simple task. For example, we put all form input boxes into a component called myinput : ]). component ( 'myinput' , { bindings : { label : '@' , model : '=' , type : '@' , max : '@' , min : '@' , step : '@' }, templateUrl : '/app/car-leasing/form_input.hh' , controller : function (){ // Decimal points if ( this . min ) { this . min = parseInt ( this . min ); } else { this . min = 0 ; } } And the template code form_input.hh (shown below). The extension .hh is chosen because .html or .htm will be picked up by Pelican for page rendering and not copied as static file even though its parent path is a STATIC . Oh well. <div class= \"row form-group\" > <span class= \"col-xs-6 col-form-label text-right\" > [[ $ctrl.label ]] </span> <div class= \"col-xs-5 input-group\" style= \"float:left;\" > <div class= \"input-group-addon\" ng-show= \"$ctrl.type=='$'\" > $ </div> <input type= \"number\" class= \"form-control\" min= \"[[$ctrl.min]]\" max= \"[[$ctrl.max]]\" step= \"[[$ctrl.step]]\" ng-model= \"$ctrl.model\" > <div class= \"input-group-addon\" ng-show= \"$ctrl.type=='%'\" > % </div> <div class= \"input-group-addon\" ng-show= \"$ctrl.type=='month'\" > month </div> </div> </div> With the component in place, rendering an form input section like this one is a breeze: ! AngularJS Component rendered form inputs To complete this, below shows the file structure: ├── app.module.js └── car-leasing ├── assumption.hh ├── car-leasing.module.js ├── form_input.hh ├── form_section_header.hh ├── piechart.hh ├── summary_line_item.hh └── var_display.hh This maps directly to the component structure of this page: Summary ← a virtual container summary line item ← summary_line_item.hh Charts ← a virtual container pie chart ← piechart.hh Form ← a virtual container form header ← form_section_header.hh input boxes ← form_input.hh derived value display ← var_display.hh REACT REACT is making a lot of buzz in my circle these days. Using this project as an exercise I decided to look into building an identical version as the Angular's. Both ended up writing about 700 lines of code so typing wise they are almost the same. REACT is done essentially in a big blob of code. I don't see there is a templating system for JSX so everything is wired in a single file. This is a plus when it's a one-man show because I don't have to jump from file to file. But I can see in large-scale project this will be a problem. Component Similar to Angular's component , view and logic are encapsulated within a REACT react component . But different from Angular's, REACT's philosophy of one-way data flow enforces design to separate props from state , which makes internal concepts clearer. State becomes only necessary if its value will change and the change will drive a UI decision. This separation makes sense to me because too often I find myself creating an army of variables just to transfer information from module to module and there is not distinction between what is to be consumed only in submodule for display or further computation, and what is to be modifiable and make the change available else where. Even though REACT's onChange event way of bubbling a change back to parent component feels awkward, it does enforce such design decision. Angular, on the other hand, gives you two-way binding for free so everything becomes changeable. It's convenient for prototyping. But in my opinion it delays these decisions which will surface in refactoring phase anyway. So I think REACT helps in this regard to make the separation more natural than Angular's way. View and Control I have been doing things in MVC pattern all along. But there is a devil lurking in background that feels strange and awkward — how to make the UX dynamic? jQuery has been the tool for the last 3-5 years. But honestly selecting element makes it tightly coupled with HTML presentation layer that it is too fragile to be maintainable! How many times you have added outer div and broke a jQuery action? Angular and REACT both make life easier by tieing an actual variable with such task. This goes back to my argument about decision making — despite that it's a UI or a business logic, if there is a decision to be made in order to set its state accordingly, such decision needs to be as explicit as possible. jQuery's element selection is too depending on the HTML structure to work right. Further, jQuery's code lives in its own <script section that it becomes hard to understand which section of the DOM it will manipulate. As a matter of fact it has access to the entire DOM so it is irrelevant which template it lives in, it can screw up the others if it chooses so. It gets even worse when using a templating system that DOM details are not known until full rendered so that the query line has to observe things like the sequence of the list item so picking the next(\"li\") gives you the one you want. These techniques is simply counter-productive . Conclusion I like both Angular and REACT . My sense at this moment is that Angular is more developed. Especially with its component design, one can do the same thing as REACT , and with all the other good stuff Angular can do. REACT is a good choice for SPA. Its one-way data binding is a great idea, IMHO, that enforces an important design decision. Putting both HTML and JS in one place is a brave attempt to define what a component is. Let's face it, in today's web application, all UI elements may respond to some user event or data event so leveraging Javascript's full power to control presentation from its birth instead from jQuery's backwards logic is the right direction.","tags":"demo","url":"https://fengxia41103.github.io/myblog/car%20leasing.html"},{"title":"Deployment architecture","text":"Deployment strategy for system architecture is centered around AWS services: EC2 for application server, RDS for database, and S3 for static files and media files. AWS does have message service as well. But to maintain a fair level of portability, I am not using that. Instead, vanilla message broker such as Redis or RabbitMQ is used and is deployed on a separate EC2 instance. In general I tend to have concerns over investing a critical system component to a 3rd party service because they usually will introduce some customization quirks that make it a real pain when migrating to another service provider or platform later on. I have not run into such problem with AWS, but would like to keep options open. Deployment architecture Notice that I do not have multiple database in the diagram. First of all, I have not had use of DB cluster. Secondly, database replica is covered by AWS snapshot which has been a great fail-safe tool for system backup and recovery. This brings up an important point I'd like to advocate: AWS services are in general far better than a setup that a developer can pull off. So unless one has a strong case, don't reinvent the wheels. Use AWS to save myself from building these essential infrastructure so that I could focus on writing application code to solve client's real problems. Service such as Heroku and GAE are even more hands-off if the application architecture can fit into their platform.","tags":"dev","url":"https://fengxia41103.github.io/myblog/deployment%20architecture.html"},{"title":"General system architecture","text":"The word \"system architect\" has been puzzling to me. I was hired to be one at one point. But it was not a comfortable position. How much do we understand the business? What is the problem we are to solve? How does the current \"architecture\" fail? What is the downfall of this (or any) proposal? Overall, I feel an architecture emerges along with development and research. The more we start to understand the client's needs, habits, workflows, relationships, priorities, the more information we have when evaluating and making decisions on whether one piece in the stack fits or not, and why so. It is, IMHO, a backwards process when an architecture is pre-defined as if it is set in stone. We need to start from somewhere, but keeping in mind that it evolves and shifts like a living organ. System architecture evolves and shifts like a living organ. This is a system architecture I have been using recently in projects. It is divided into four components: foreground service provider : this includes machinery that interface with web server, taking HTTP and AJAX requests, and generate response to request. The core of this component is Python Django . Django is chosen for its reputation, for my past experience, for its maturity, excellent documentations and a broad user base. Backed by Python, it is a great starting point for building a web application. background service provider : it handles all code executions that do not need be in synchronous fashion with a user request. The key here is task queue integrated using Celery with Redis or RabbitMQ . These replaced what used to be messy multithreading code that were prone to error and hard to debug. Besides, architecture wise these message queues extend well, so it's a natural fit for cloud deployment. data storage service : traditional RDBMS and file system. A consideration here is certainly to include remote storage such as AWS. The key point is to separate static data (style sheets, JS scripts, media files) from dynamic application data. A side note. I think the distinction is rather misleading since most application data become stale(static) also once generated, and many image data nowadays are saved in DB (so system backup takes one step instead of two). Both have its use. integration service : customized code to implement third party system integration. In general, CRUD operations are handled through frontend API(REST) service. There is also so called backdoor tasks that covers cases where data may get pumped directly into data storage via ORM layers. Such cases may include initial data import, runtime data synchronization, data extraction and system backup. Feng's system architecture diagram The beauty of this architecture is that message queue becomes a distribution hub where tasks are dispatched to different destination end point for processing. This greatly reduces the complexity of inter- and intra- system communication. Knowing that queue servers can be easily extended if load become heavy is yet another benefit to have in term of scalability. As shown in the diagram, background queue tasks are being used solely to generate and consume model data (including media data since media has always some meta data components). This means they do not participate to generate inline view response. Instead, they take instruction from user input and distribute those intensive code for asynchronous processing. This remedies Django's synchronous nature (I say it is synchronous in the sense of that a Django's native process will receive and process view request without interrupt or callback. Django signals are asynchronous, however.) where a long running code section could bring the entire application to halt.","tags":"dev","url":"https://fengxia41103.github.io/myblog/general%20system%20architecture.html"},{"title":"DIY Pelican theme","text":"As a Python house, Pelican is definitely a winner for our blog site.

That is to say, I want to see an idea in action before I feel comfortable of its existence and the soundness its being. A few years back when I first started a career as engineer, I learned a valuable lesson. After making modifications based on a requirement and checked code into SourceSafe (a Microsoft source control product), I thought all was well, until a senior team member called on me. Part of his job was to mentor and supervise my work. He asked to review the change. So we sat down side by side. I showed him and he said it was a good job. Then he said,\"Not that I don't trust you. It's just my thing that I need to see things with my own eyes in order to believe.\" Fast forward to now, after 20 years doing software development and project management, I am leaning more and more towards this \"seeing things with my own eyes\" mentality. Maybe it is an age thing. But considering the complexity of a software application these days and the precision it requires, being conservative is a good trait. Prototype, or proof-of-concept (POC), is a wonderful thing. In my opinion it serves four important functions: It proves the concept . Nothing is more valuable than knowing the path in mind is not a dead end. This applies in particular to those projects that have large share of uncertainties. Taking a trip to Mars is not mind-boggling if you know your friend John has just traveled there and back. But if you were the first one sent to Mars, oh boy. It formulates a design . Over the process of building a prototype, key components will be researched, evaluated, adopted, developed, integrated and tested. System boundaries will emerge. Key functions and services will be grouped into at least three tiers: low-hanging fruits, hard but do-ables, and dont-know-hows. This knowledge, in turn, will drive task priorities, task estimation, and risk evaluation. All these will become a cornerstone of the system design so it will be practical, executable, and working. It builds communication . Building prototypes involves lots of discussions. Clients brain dumps their expectations to dev team, while dev team internalizes those business functions into a coherent picture illustrated using their familiar technology jargon. Details that hold importance but have been neglected will be discovered and ironed out. A common knowledge base and a common vocabulary will be built over the course. Instead of business syntax on one side (requirements) while some technology jargon on the other (SQL? Queue?), we now have a vocabulary that all could understand, contribute, and use to effectively communicate. This reminds me a strategy by Starbucks. Their staff will repeat a customer's order in a particular sequence: Hot or iced. Size. Decaf. Number of shots (if any extra) Number of pumps of syrup (if you're that specific) Type of milk. Any extras (mo' whip, mo' deliciousness) Drink type (latte, Frappuccino, etc.) Why do they do that? To build a common a vocabulary and to improve communication. The result, less error and happier customer. It removes risks . Hiccups will be discovered early on in the game; workarounds will be put in place; strategies will be clarified; team knowledge will be shared; and collaboration will be formed and adapted. Let's put it this way: if a POC did not work out, whether it be because of technical challenge or organizational barrier, the full-blown project is not gonna succeed. So next time you have an exciting idea that will dominate the world, take that drawing on napkin to build a prototype, because as the old saying, seeing is believing.","tags":"thoughts","url":"https://fengxia41103.github.io/myblog/thoughts-on-prototype.html"},{"title":"ODOO8 native server loading process","text":"During daily development of ODOO8 modules, one thing I have been noticing is the slowness when ODOO first boot up. We are observing up to minutes of a bootup time. This plainly is too slow. Watching debug prints indicates that ODOO scans through all modules listed on Python path and builds a map in memory before dev server starts responding to request. Intuitively I suspected such loading practice is causing an unnecessary delay. This aggravates further when ODOO server becomes completly unusable if any of the module chokes during this loading process. But this is too common a scenario during development. One consequence of this is that debugging becomes difficult. Often enough ODOO doesn't yield useful trace track to help determine the root cause of an error. Another problem of such approach is the availability of servic becoming binary — it either fully works or nothing runs. By analogy, the ODOO loading process is like compiling phase in running a C code. No executable is available until the compiler and linker are happy. Under this light, this article analyzes this booting process with a hope to understand why ODOO takes such an approach and how we could improve or circumvent during development in order to gain efficiency. Considering a developer lives with this bootup process as a daily need, it becomes interesting how we can reduce this bootup time. Quick glance Tracing through ODOO boot code, we have illustrated steps of ODOO's loading process in diagram below: ODOO8 loading sequence Why does ODOO call tools.config.parse_config twice? The function fullfills the same purpose by parsing the configuration file and builds the in memory tools.config global variable. This is redundant. Server selection The meat of this loading is to boot up a HTTP server. ODOO offers three types of servers: ThreadedServer PreforkServer GeventServer But which one to use? If configuration option config['workers'] is non zero, it will pick the PreforkServer ; otherwise, it takes default ThreadedServer . if openerp . evented : server = GeventServer ( openerp . service . wsgi_server . application ) elif config [ 'workers' ]: server = PreforkServer ( openerp . service . wsgi_server . application ) else : server = ThreadedServer ( openerp . service . wsgi_server . application ) ThreadedServer runs in a single thread, where PreforServer uses select to handle multiprocessing . This choice apparently makes the prefork server more appealing for production site. ODOO's own manual on deployment also confirms this: Odoo includes built-in HTTP servers, using either multithreading or multiprocessing. For production use, it is recommended to use the multiprocessing server as it increases stability, makes somewhat better use of computing resources and can be better monitored and resource-restricted. * Multiprocessing is enabled by configuring a non-zero number of worker processes, the number of workers should be based on the number of cores in the machine (possibly with some room for cron workers depending on how much cron work is predicted) * Worker limits can be configured based on the hardware configuration to avoid resources exhaustion Threaded server How good is ODOO's default server then? Diagram below illustrates the truth of an ODOO threaded server. Under layers of function call, ODOO's threaded server is simply a Python native HTTPServer instance. So the question boils down to how good Python's native http server is comparing to some well known names — nginx , Apache , lighthttpd , or even further, WSGI servers such as Guicorn and uwsgi . ODOO8 ThreadedServer Runtime call trace Diagram below illustrates a full call trace while ODOO8 boots up. This was generated by Pycallgraph . pycallgraph -v -d -s -i openerp. \\* -e openerp.report. \\* -e openerp.tools.config.configmanager. \\* -e openerp.loglevels. \\* -e openerp.tools. \\* --max-depth = 10 graphviz --output-file = odoo8.png -- odoo.py -c ../works/contract/8290.conf The decision to exclude these patters, in particular, the openerp.report.* is purely out of layout consideration — it clutters the diagram too much. This, on the other hand, could be considered as a clue why bootup is slow. Note that no tool can do static analysis of code and generate a call stack. The only sure way to create this is to run the code and monitor its runtime stack, in which case language such as Python shines due its interpreting nature. The Python GIL will keep track the entire call trace in its memory and knows details of call stack. ODOO 8 loading call trace diagram Thoughts After examining ODOO code and its run time, two areas I would recommend ODOO to reconsider its approach: how configuration options are being shared among modules using ThreadedServer as default Configuration options First concern coming out of this analysis is how ODOO handles values in the configuration file. In openerp.tools ODOO defined a variable config . import openerp.tools.config thus will expose the config to the caller. This essentially makes the configuration object globally. I don't know whether I should call this a trick or a bad practice. So in short, ODOO's configuration is global. The proper way to handle this is to either set it up as global , or making caller to parse the disk conf file if it needs information. The former will build an in memory image. As long as it is in read-only mode, no locking mechanism is needed. The downside is that disck changes won't necessarily update the in memory object. The latter is better, though more expansive since disk file is accessed each time. ThreadedServer My suspecion is that native server is suitable for development environment, but lacks features to be production ready. I'm considering features such as plugin loading (think Apache2), configuration, security, HTTP protocol support, SSL...? In short, ODOO's ThreadedServer works fine as development tool, but should not be used for production deployment unless, well, the client is the least sophisticated (oh boy there are so many of them that it is actually creating a whole nine yard of different problems than this one) and creates minimal load in reality.","tags":"odoo","url":"https://fengxia41103.github.io/myblog/odoo8%20server%20loading%20process.html"},{"title":"Buildbot continuous integration setup","text":"The whole point of quick development cycle is to shorten the path between a verbal or written requirement, and an actionable application that reflects an implementation of this requirement. Therefore, it becomes crucial to set up an CI environment not only to facilitate development and testing, but to enforce our practice of agile prototyping by setting up a complete automated test instance for our clients that closely mirrors development progress. Once achieved, clients and developers can now truely accalaim that they are on the same page . Buildbot We chose buildbot as our CI tool. Another common choice is the jenkins . Jenkins is in Java. So in order to maintain a technology stack as consistent as we can, we opted to buildbot for this purpose. Installation Create a python virtualenv and use pip is all it takes: $ workon build $ pip install buildbot $ pip install buildbot-slave For configuration, you can refer to buildbot tutorial for more details. On our test server, I have set the paths to: master: ~/build-master slave: ~/build-slave Run service activate build virtualenv. to start master: buildbot start build-master to start slave: buildslave start build-slave To view and administrate our CI server : * username: admin * pwd: xxxxxx To restart master and slave: * master: buildbot restart build-master * slave: buildslave restart build-slave If config has been modified, it is useful to run buildbot checkconfig build-master to check configurations for error. Note that it is recommended to start master before the slave. In practice I have not experienced any problem if this order was reversed. Build master configurations We modified the stock master.cfg to make slaves modular. With this, adding a new slave only requires two changes: import slave's .py add slave configurations to master (nearly a copy and paste) Sample master.cfg is shown here: # -*- python -*- # ex: set syntax=python: from buildbot.plugins import * from buildbot.plugins import steps from buildbot.plugins import status from buildbot.status import html from buildbot.status.web import authz , auth # <==================================== # import slave configuration import test_gkp # <==================================== # This is the dictionary that the buildmaster pays attention to.

Add it to build-master/master.cfg. Restart build master: buildbot restart build-master. Login to buildbot admin web UI to confirm that slave has been added successfully. Force a build to test.

Their functions are meant for operator to book-keep information of daily operations. Once these data points have been captured, the power of the application shines in term of data analysis and reporting. Reports can be grouped into three categories: reports at product level : top seller, top purchased, top profitable reports at order level : top SO by qty balance, top SO in-progress fulfills reports of seller/buyer account level : customer AR, vendor AP Data points are essentially rolled up following this pattern: product level → order level → account level. Product level reports Top selling product Knowing the top seller is the most important thing for any business. The report is compiled from sales orders to show which product is high in demand. Top seller report Top profitable product Your best seller shows the demand, but they are not necessarily the best for your business if their margin is low. Instead, a high margin item may be the target that your next market campaign should focus on. Together with the top seller report , these two can give good insights to guide your pricing strategy and marketing efforts. A negative profit margin is a clear signal that something is not correct in either the price or the vendor cost of product. It can be a simple typo, but can also be an indicator of wrong strategy. Most profitable product report Top purchased product Top purchased product can be a result of a good sales. But it can also become staled stocks sitting there. The mismatch between your top seller and top purchased should always deserve a further analysis in order to ensure that your business is not just piling up inventory without an exit plan. Top purchased product report Order level reports Top sales orders by QTY balance Purpose of this report is to monitor sales orders whose fulfillment is lagging behind. The higher the QTY balance is, the more risk there is that the order fails to fulfill properly. However, it does not distinguish between an order that has zero fulfillment rate and the ones that are in-progress. Top sales order by QTY balance report Top SO in-progress fulfills This report monitors in-progress sales orders that have received some levels of fulfillment. The higher the fulfillment rate is, the healthier the order is. A negative rate is possible when such type of sales allows filing product returns without linking it to a fulfillment. That's usually the case when filing return and filing fulfillment form are handled by two groups of people who are not synchronized. Top sales order in-progress fulfills report Account level reports At account level, we created customer account receivable report and vendor account payable report. Both are health indicators of how well we are maintaining a relationship with our peers.

In this article I'll talk about orders. Sales order and purchase order are like two sides of the same coin. Each sales order(SO) can include a mixed bag of products from different vendors. Once a SO has been created, application will parse it into multiple purchase order (PO) and route them to their vendor. Reversely, company can place a PO with a vendor, and purchased products can be used to fulfill multiple sales orders later. Order life cycle To understand the design of orders, one has to first grasp the life cycle of an order. I'd like to divide its functions into roughly two areas: about physical good and about money . The area of physical goods takes care of the acquisition of products on order. This includes shipping, receiving, reconciliation, inventory, product return and substitution. Like what we did in inventory, we maintain a theoretical list which comes from the sales order itself (think of it as a wish list) and an actual list which tracks all the above activities. The ratio between the two is full-fill rate . All products are cleared when full-fill rate hits 100%. At this point, seller has fulfilled what the buyer is expecting, either by original products or replacement or any other forms of settlement in between. Order life cycle The second area of interest is about money. Depending on the business model and industry, some will require a form of payment, either by a percentage or in full, before any shipment, while others can live with zero down up front. The hinge that links activities handling physical goods and the money is the invoice . Invoice is a detailed record (bill) that both the seller and the buyer will eventually agree in order to proceed with a financial reconciliation. Ideally buyer pays against an invoice, though I have seen other forms of arrangement in different industries. Therefore, on the money side there are also a theoretical represented by invoices and an actual which are actual payments. The ratio between these two forms payment ratio . To simplify things here we will regard financial reconciliation is complete when payment ratio hits 100%. Create an order Sales order can be taken in one of two ways. The quick way is designed for internal staff to create an sales order by directly typing in line items using a simple syntax: Each line starts with SKU number, followed by comma delimited size-qty pairs. For example, 234, S-1, M-2 is to order product SKU# 234 , one small and two medium . Alternatively one can also create a sales order through traditional shopping cart method. One can use a quick way or shopping cart to create a sales order Order summary and details A nice feature here is that for an aggregated information such as total quantity and sum, the application offers a dropdown that user can easily view a broken-down detail by each vendor. Order details are grouped by vendor also. Each vendor tab has details of products on order. At the bottom of tab, the application computes a total qty and total value for that vendor. Order detail tabs are a set of shopping basket, one per vendor Product receiving and fulfillment Product receiving is represented by fulfillment in the application. I call an item fulfilled when buyer side has received and accepted that item. In turn, fulfill rate is the count of items that met this condition over the total products on order. It is important to note that only accepted one is counted as fulfilled. Received counts are inaccurate because item can be received but then returned due to damage. fulfill rate = count of fulfilled item / total number of items Create an order fulfillment Fulfilling a product is almost like filling in an inventory count sheet. Potentially this can be automated using barcode scanner or other form of scanning technology But unlike a count sheet that is specific for a vendor, fulfillment form lists all vendors and products on order. This accounts for the fact that shipments can come in at random order. Therefore, showing them on a single page saves the receiving staff from jumping through multiple screens in order to record shipments. QTY BALANCE column shows the remaining quantity that the application is expecting. This is the theoretical value for a line time, and the addition of all received fulfillment will be the actual . Fulfillment summary Fulfillment summary is a great way to keep track of receiving status. One interesting distinction here is the fulfill rate of quantity versus that of value . This accounts for the fact that products have different values. Therefore, a 90% fulfill rate of quantity may not be a good news if in value the fulfill rate is much lower. Monitoring this gap can be an early warning sign that the supplier is lagging behind. Finalizing a fulfillment is to lock in the receiving status. User can either do this on each fulfillment (eg. in a long running order where fulfillment come in over a stretched period of time), or close them all with a single click. Simple. Return a product Product return is a common scenario. Rule we applied here is that quantity available for return is determined by received fulfillments . This also means that a return is always associated with an order. This contrasts to the approach where return is checked against inventory regardless how that product got into the inventory at the first place. Return a product Also, each line item needs a reason . The list is configurable. An important decision to make is who will absorb the damage, seller or buyer. For example, if the agreement is that buyer bears damages if it was caused by third-party shipper, then no credit will be issued, which in the application shows as unchanged account payable . Otherwise, if seller is to pay for this, a credit will be deducted from the current account payable so buyer owes less now due to the return. Make a payment Make a payment The application has not yet integrated with a payment system. As of now it provides a function to register a payment against an order. Also, user can finalize a payment by reviewing it. This in effect locks down the payment so it is not editable anymore. Review a payment Drop shipping Drop shipping is a supply chain management method in which the retailer does not keep goods in stock but instead transfers customer orders and shipment details to either the manufacturer, another retailer, or a wholesaler, who then ships the goods directly to the customer. A sales order can include products from different vendors. When we shop at Amazon, products do not necessarily come from an Amazon warehouse. Instead, the order is routed to the actual seller who will fulfill the order as if he works for Amazon. The application parses automatically a sales order into multiple purchase orders, one per vendor. These orders will then be tracked individually for fulfillment, payment and so forth. Keep purchase orders in sync with sales order in drop shipping Purchase order I have always viewed purchase as the mirror image of sales. It really depends on whose view you are referring to because in any transaction there are always two parties, one will sell and the other will buy. So from buyer's stand point of view, an order is a PO, and the same order is a SO for the seller. In turn, a SO will reduce inventory while PO increases inventory. However, SO and PO bring in some important factors in practice besides driving the supply chain in opposite directions. First, tax. In most cases seller is responsible for paying tax. In application this becomes a requirement that SO has functions to compute and track tax. Because each business model, industry, state and country can be quite different in this matter, this is an area I have experienced a lot of customization and code refactoring. Second, what is the relationship of a SO and a PO in your business? Drop shipping, for example, can be modeled as a back-to-back 1-N model where one SO is parsed to create multiple(N) POs. This provides full traceability from sales to purchase. Retail, on the other hand, may purchase in bulk with PO way before a SO takes place. Therefore, seller may not be interested in knowing the product just sold came from which PO. But on top of this, there are retail business to whom such traceability is required, for example, food retailer. Therefore, attempting to answer this question with a single answer will not work! What is missing is a business context, something that provides additional information for the application to make such decision. In my client's case, she sells supplier's stock under her name with a markup. Goods are then shipped to her distribution warehouse before re-shipped to end client. Therefore, when the application runs in this business context it will enforce a back-to-back SO-PO reference. She also runs a wholesale business in which purchase and sales have no such strong bound. Thus the application will leave the SO-PO reference optional. Purchase order summary An interesting thing of fashion industry is that product often has long lead time. For most vendors a calendar year is divided into two seasons — Spring/Summer season and Fall/Winter season. Buyer will place PO in October or even earlier for the Spring/Summer season of next year. So it is not uncommon to see a 6-month lead time, which introduces large amount of uncertainties to the buyer's operation. To accommodate this, it is wise to keep informed by vendor on which line item will be available when. In application we have add a dropdown list, \"Available In\" , so this information is captured: unknown : default state, vendor has not released information of its availability never : this product has been dropped out or sold out local : can be fulfilled right now by vendor's local outlet Jan - Dec : calendar month. Its year is implied. Purchase order line item availability In this article, I have covered sales order and purchase order. They are the core of the company's operation. In part three , we will get to the exciting part of the application where all these data points will be utilized to drive a better operation.","tags":"fashion","url":"https://fengxia41103.github.io/myblog/fashion%20orders.html"},{"title":"Fashion ERP — introduction","text":"Project Fashion is an ERP system built from ground up based on operations in an international trading company who has a specialty in fashion products. Each season there are between 10 and 20 vendors and a few thousand new SKUs. Most vendors roll out new designs twice per year — spring/summer season and fall/winter season. Some may have new products every month. To keep track of these products and keep up with vendor's schedule have been the primarily challenge this coompany has. The system's role, therefore, is to replace previously paper-based operations with now an online version so that product catelogue can be centrally maintained, and multiple subsidaries who are geographically separated can coordinate sales, purchase and inventory, and upper management can receive instant up-to-date reports and the ability to drill down to SKU level details when needed. Unlike a full blown ERP, a decision was made during design to remove complexity so user and customer can operate with little training. Configurable UI and workflow were scratched off. Instead, hard coded workflow and accurate cross reference were implemented so operator at each business function can understand and operate her job intutitively. On the broad side, functions are divided into the following categories: CRM : customer and vendor database Product : product database Inventory : product inventory Sales : sales order Purchase : purchase order Invoice : order invoices Report : management reports Product The key concept I'd like to clarify is the product SKU . It has been a surprise to me how many people who, even have been working in this industry for years, do not understand SKU. SKU is a stock unit. In other words, it is the smallest unit the company chooses to manage its product. The more detailed it is, the more accurate the rest of the operations can be, but also the more work to set it up initially. For staffs, search by filter One interesting challenge relates to how one finds a particular product in the system. Shoppers are visual animals. During 2015 Fall/Winter season we followed clients in stores and observed their pattern. All went on by first picking a cloth up from rack and looking at it before she seeked out for more concrete information such as its vendor or season. On the other hand, staffs can often directly recall a product through their familiarity with its attributes such as vendor, season, name and style's serial number, instead of seeing it physically. Therefore, to staffs filtering by these attributes will be more efficient. For customers, browse/search by season and vendor The search by season function is built with an e-Commerce interface in mind. Customers are to \"browse\" instead of \"search\". Products are first grouped by season then by vendor. Customer browse through product catelogue as if in a e-shop so it creates a more direct experience that filter boxes. User can drill down from season to vendor, and to add product to shopping cart which later turns into a sales order. Inventory Product inventory are mapped to a 3-layer structure: company — location — storages. A location represents a store, and within a store there can be multiple storages. Inventory in storage can then be rolled up to location level and company level. There is also a common setup of region or district level that is between company and location. It is not implemented but can be added easily. Inventory structure diagram For each product, there are two inventory counts: theoretical and actual . Theoretical counts are derived from sales, purchase, returns and so forth; actual counts are directly obtained from physically counting products in a storage, also called physical inventory. As you can see, theoretical counts are dynamic because they are influenced by business activities. Physical inventory is a snapshot in time when a staff walks into the store's storage to count. Therefore, it is crucial to understand that comparing the two implies a time stamp that both sides have to agree. Otherwise, such comparison is meaningless. Theoretical inventory Physical inventory Product count will increase and decrease dynamically due to sales and purchase. Product count is obstained only through counting goods in inventory physically. Physical inventory is usually scheduled. Some companies have daily count while some have weekly or monthly count. On physical inventory page, user can select from a list of storages to do the counting. Season and vendor list within each storage are derived from products in that storage by the application automatically. Select location and vendor to count When taking the physical count, one has two modes to choose from depending on how counting is done. Admin mode displays product details such as style and size. They are used as assisting information to the counting staff. Counts are default to 0. Only the ones having a non-zero count will be highlighted and saved later. However, it is possible that a product has been sold out. So to handle this special case we use a star to indicate this situation. Physical inventory admin mode User mode removes product details from the view, leaving only product SKU and size information for reference. Physical inventory user mode So far I have covered Product and Inventory functions. In part two , I will dive into the core of this application to talk about how we will handle sales orders and purchase orders.","tags":"fashion","url":"https://fengxia41103.github.io/myblog/fashion%20introduction.html"},{"title":"Project Fashion Demo","text":"Project Fashion front page Demo Login: (demo, demopassword) Project Fashion is built to support daily business of an international trading company who specializes fashion products. Main functions of the application include product management, customer and vendor database, order management (both sales and purchase), and inventory management. The company is based in US with two subsidiaries in mainland China. Its challenges lied in multiple folds. First, orders and updates are emailed back and forth which is error prone and can be quickly out of sync with reality. Second, operation becomes unaccountable when critical data points are missing, eg. who made the last modification 2of a sales order? Third, vendors are operating in Europe and North America time zones while the company's customers are in China. The time difference and geographical separation between the two ends make information flow difficult without a centrally maintained information repository. Cloud drives were tried but still they lack the capability to provide a coherent view for both sides. On top of these issues, the company was to launch an initiative to develop an e-Commerce platform for its customers and vendors. This calls for a backbone system that can support not only the company's currently offline operations, but its strategy going forward. Without a further delay, I will introduce the core functions and design considerations in these articles: product and inventory sales order and purchase order reporting","tags":"demo","url":"https://fengxia41103.github.io/myblog/project%20fashion%20demo.html"},{"title":"GKP — major details","text":"In part one and part two , I have introduced functions to assist students get to know about the schools from multiple aspects. In this article, we will touch upon another important factor when going to college — major. In China, majors are split into three layers: category, subcategory, and majors. Similar to the state-city-school configuration, functions at category and subcategory level focus on statistic analysis so to offer an overview, where major level contains details that are relevant to that particular major which students would find useful. Majors are split into 3 layers According to document published by the Department of Education in 2012, there are 12 categories, 92 subcategories and 506 majors. Category and subcategory At this level, focus was to provide statistics which is similar to what is done for schools at State level . Major category and subcategory Students can quickly browse through category and subcategory to locate area of interest she wants to drill further down. Major At this level, we think the most relevant information students want to know is the job market datat. So we built an integration point with popular job posting sites. Dynamically the application will query these sites and compile the most recent 50 job posts that matches this major. Job title cloud Based on these data stream, a job title keyword cloud is compiled taht shows the job titles used by the industry, and they are further grouped into cities so they provide another geo reference for students. Schools grouped by job locations Below listed jobs, application will conveniently show schools that are located in those cities since local graduate usually have an advantage competing for jobs in local market. Another feature is that a toggle switch will turn user's preference on and off so researcher can easily search either by major and jobs alone, or by combination of the market data and her own criteria.","tags":"gkp","url":"https://fengxia41103.github.io/myblog/gkp%20majors.html"},{"title":"GKP — school details","text":"In part one , we have introduced functions that will help school research at nation level, state and city level. In this article I'll talk about features built to help research at school level . Bookmark While research schools, it is useful to bookmark a page for later use. That's where the bookmark feature comes in. User can save unlimited bookmarks and manage them by x-out (remove) it from saved list. Convenient. Bookmark a school School summary School summary are mostly text extracted from multiple sources. The first page contains an introduction, or a quick view, of the school. It contains many meta data that can be extracted to form more data dimensions. School summary School detail page expands on top of the introduction. One small feature concerning development is that TOC is auto generated. School wiki Historical admission scores This page lists historical cutoff scores that the school has applied in past admissions. GKP has collected over 2,000,000 data records between 2010 and 2014 and covering 3,000 schools. School historical cutoff scores Students can then use these scores as reference compared to her estimated exam score in order to get a sense of how likely she will be admitted. Social life One important factor to consider, also a unique feature of this application, is the campus social life. Here we created an advanced backend engine to tap into popular social media facilities and pull in live chat stream at 50,000 new posts per minute . This gives students a rich information on how the campus life is like. School social media data stream Data stream is being updated every 60 seconds. So for a user it is convenient to leave the window open and watch new posts appear on the screen instead of refreshing page manually. Also, there is a voting mechanism behind the scene so that the more users a page is being viewed (thus indicating more popularity), the higher priority the page has in term of receiving the next update. Social media keyword cloud and news ticker Based on these streamed social media data, the application provides a Keyword Cloud (shown on the left) that reflects hot topics in the most recent 100 threads. Further, the Live Campus (shown on the right) section shows thread summaries in a scrolling news ticker fashion which makes monitoring these threads simple and fun. Wechat channels Wechat is a whatsapp equivalent in China. It has a dominating role especially among young people. Here user will find a list of Wechat channels that are affiliated with the candidate school, including school news, clubs, communities and activities. Connecting to them is as simple as scanning the barcode with her phone. It is another unique feature that makes acquiring school information as painless as possible. School Wechat channels Major In part one and this article, we have introduced research functions that assist user at different level of interest. Here comes another important consideration that any student must have — majors. What to study is often driven by interest, but also it is closely affected by its future job seeking prospective. In part three — majors we will go over these topics.","tags":"gkp","url":"https://fengxia41103.github.io/myblog/gkp%20schools.html"},{"title":"GKP — introduction","text":"GKP project was conceived from a meeting with a friend of mine, Mr.Zhang, back in Jan, 2015. Mr.Zhang has been in China's college education business for 15 year. He has succeeded in building a couple online training services and is also the head of a private college. The GKP project is to consolidate multiple data sources into one place so to facilitate high school graduates and their parents searching and evaluating college and university. In this article I'll give a brief introduction of core functions and thoughts behind each design. It also illustrates how we have approached each problem with the solution you are currently seeing. User preference An important tool is the user preference . Each user can specify her own searching criteria so to narrow down from a general search to a more customized version. Set up user preferences These settings are related directly to how Chinese college categorize students. Take the Geo requirement setting for example. Let's say that MIT takes 3,000 freshmen each year. Instead of accepting application nation wide, MIT assigns a fixed quota to each state. Some states get more quota comparing to their share of the student population, while others get less. A student from a low quota-to-student ratio state will then have a reduced chance of getting into MIT even though she meets the school's qualification. To enforce this arrangement, it is a hard requirement that student can only attend national entrance exam in the state that her birth place is registered (户口) (This is a simplified version, but is generally true). Therefore, regardless where she lives now, she is locked in to the quota assigned to her home state. This is a sad reality. Nation level: a school map The drive behind this function is that students often have a geo preference in mind. This function is to make it easy when she wants to browse schools based on its geo location. Initially I was to build a Google map view with overlayed filter. Geo code was looked up first using Google map API. This alone took about a week to resolve limited by the upper limit Google imposed on each API account and the initial trial and error time. Drawing the map was straightforward using Google map API and marker cluster . Using Google map to browse schools However, a couple issues with this approach: Computing markers within the view bound was time consuming. This is especially so when user has few filtering criteria. This will result in displaying all schools on the map. Zooming in will reduce the number of markers. So a potential solution is to set the initial zoom large enough to view only a section of the country's territory. Some addresses were not resolved or resolved incorrectly. They were viewable on Google map itself, but the returned geo code was different. It feels like Google uses a better version for his own use and serves the rest of us with a lower quality data set. A way to resolve this is to check the address with other geo decoding services. So I tried Baidu map API. That's when all hell broke loose. First of all, two systems yielded two different geo codes for the same school address! How could this be? Are they having two different GPS systems? My guess is that their data providers are different. But whose data is correct? Further, displayed location on the map are different, sometimes not even close. Then I tried swapping geo code for the purpose of experiment — using Google's geo code to plot on Baidu map. The result was even stranger. This made me to think that either Google or Baidu has massaged their data on purpose in order to create this incompatibility. Considering the GFW, I abandoned both maps and back to a simple Chart. Map is drawn using Echarts . School map using Echarts Legend on the bottom left corner shows school counts categorized into different shades of color. The darker an area is, the more schools there are. Schools in each state are further grouped by its city (shown on the right) and can be drilled down. State level: statistics Next layer below a national view of all schools on a country map is at state level. Most people have a general idea of state, such as its climate, culture, food, and so forth. So here instead of these information, we focused on aggregated data analysis. In short, schools within the same state boundary will be grouped along different dimensions. Statistics are then computed on the fly to provide quick facts. School statistics quickview at State level Each dimension can be drilled down to reveal more stats. Among them, two important dimensions are important for a student — Bachelor's vs. Associate program, and tiers. School statistics drill down by programs and admission tiers The distinction in the degrees are simple to understand. Some schools and programs offer certificate program while others are accredited by the government to issue degrees. A unique concept here is the admission tier . In China, all college admissions fall into one of the four tiers listed in descending time order — pre tier, 1st tier, 2nd tier and 3rd tier . Tiers work in a waterfall mode. School start with top tier in an admission cycle and moves down the tiers until all spots are filled. Therefore the lower the tier is, the less likely a top school will come by. On the other hand, lower tier has a lower score requirement. Pre tier is for school with specialized program, eg. military schools. Often, it is also the time when elite students get picked by school. For all others, they have to make a decision prior to the exam day which tier she is going into, and the primary reference is her estimated score. School statistics drill down by school types Another dimension is the type of school. Students who want to study arts can quickly find schools specializing in that. City level What would student want to know about a city? First of all, some general data imported from wikipedia. Since wikipedia does not have an API for keyword search, the challenge was to have the computer matching city name to a wiki page and parse the page for imported data bits. City wiki Next, an interesting idea came up during our discussion. How convenient is it to get to the city from where I live? So we decided to build a train schedule that will show exactly which train are available to take, all stops in between, and the actual time elapse. City to city train schedule search engine Considering that no map API or travel search engine can mix up flight with train to generate a complete door-to-door route, this function has a great potential to be extended into a service of its own where flight, train, bus and subway data are matched up. School level Everything comes down to school level where school specific details are laid out to assist prospective students evaluate not only the future academic life but also its social life. Read on our part two — school details .","tags":"gkp","url":"https://fengxia41103.github.io/myblog/gkp%20introduction.html"},{"title":"Project Stock Backtesting Demo","text":"Project Stock frontpage Demo Login: (demo, demopassword) This project started at lunch with a friend who has been trading stocks as hobby for years.

So here it is, a tool that can test a trading strategy over S&P 500 daily data and a few other data sets. The cool thing about this application is that simulation is done as background process and report has not only statistics compared against some index such as the S&P 500, but a detailed step-by-step transaction trace that is ready for a replay.

It is a web tool that helps high school graduates in China to find a right college. The grand vision is to make it a one-stop shop to get information that are mostly relevant at each step of research. When we first conceived this idea, the leader in this field was a Chinese startup company, 高考派 (aka. GKP). It was rumored that the company was facing a pending acquisition with a enticing price tag. After diving into their site for a few weeks, we came to realize that beneath the skin of their application, its baseline data was seriously broken. For example, GKP's core feature was its historical exam data. However, we found a dozen similar sources all claimed to have the same data set. But surprisingly there have been hard reached to find agreement between any of the two data sets! This cast a serious doubt on the validity of these services. Further analysis of them made it clear that even though China's college admission is centralized around test scores, selecting the right school is not. There are rich set of peripheral information that students and their families would like to consider besides a test score. But none of them offered much help. Therefore, we have shifted our strategy and embarked on a different journey. Score is becoming one facet of a multi-dimension information repository. We focused on identifying channels and means students are using to acquire information, and the types of information that they would want to have access to at different context of research — what is important to know about the city? the school itself? the people in school? how easy to get there and come home?...

Data crawling is an exciting business. On one hand, it is easy to develop a crawler these days. In the Python world, plenty tutorials will show you how to build a simple crawler using the Python urllib , or building upon some more sophisticate tool like Scrapy . Fun with regular expression But before carried away by the fun and the power, let's lay down a ground rule — to respect peer server and try hard being a good web citizen. We surely learned a few lessons here. So please take notes and hopefully you won't fall into the same pit. Banned We used to joke about this — if you haven't been banned by a server, you haven't hit it hard enough. Well, we were banned. Our first version was a simple urllib based agent and could be run in multiprocessing mode. Target was a public site run by a small startup firm, which by rumor consisted mostly of developers, too. So we took this on almost like an arm race. from urllib3 import PoolManager , Retry , Timeout , ProxyManager class PlainUtility (): def __init__ ( self ): user_agent = 'Mozilla/5.0 (Windows; U; Windows NT 5.1; en-US; rv:1.9.0.7) Gecko/2009021910 Firefox/3.0.7' self . headers = { 'User-Agent' : user_agent } self . ip_url = 'http://icanhazip.com/' self . logger = logging . getLogger ( 'gkp' ) retries = Retry ( connect = 5 , read = 5 , redirect = 5 ) self . agent = PoolManager ( 10 , retries = retries , timeout = Timeout ( total = 30.0 )) def current_ip ( self ): return self . request ( self . ip_url ) def request ( self , url ): r = self . agent . request ( 'GET' , url ) if r . status == 200 : return r . data else : self . logger . error ( 'status %s ' % r . status ) We kicked off the crawler in multiprocessing mode (between 200-300 subprocesses) and sat back to watch data pouring in, until a 403 forbidden , ban! Needless to say, the server must have experienced a trigger event which prompted the action. What could it be? First, load. We suspected the load we were generating put us on the radar. This was a public site who claimed a over three million live daily users. However, I have always viewed such information with a grain of salt. So in this case, we guessed those million members were certainly not clicking at the same time as we were, and that site was likely hosted on a budget server as many startups have done. With this consideration, one measure to implement — throttling (and if you have a website, don't blow up your user number to make it look too good to be True, unless you are ready to handle the hits.) Further, from the time we were hitting the server to the time the ban came in, a few days have elapsed. So the reaction was likely taken by a manual intervention instead of a computerized protection. This is a security hazard on their end. Last, we moved to a different wifi access and used the same code, it went through without a glitch. So another thing became clear, the defense was IP based, which meant all computers in our office were helpless now because they shared the same outbound IP. A few possibilities to resolve this. First, moving around free wifi. But that is just not nice. Crossed off the list with a 100% vote. Second, use a VPN. This is a good and common approach. We could use either an in-house server or a commercial one. But that's too, \"boring\", said one developer. So after a few tries, we ended up with something quite interesting, simple yet powerful. Besides the old school PlainUtility , I have introduced two upgrades → TorUtility and SeleniumUtility . Both added a layer of indirection to the puzzle, but also a layer of protection. TOR First layer added to our stack is to use TOR network as our proxy to serve request. Further, because TOR service is a socket proxy, not a HTTP proxy, we installed another layer, privoxy in between to connect the two. class TorUtility (): def __init__ ( self ): user_agent = 'Mozilla/5.0 (Windows; U; Windows NT 5.1; en-US; rv:1.9.0.7) Gecko/2009021910 Firefox/3.0.7' self . headers = { 'User-Agent' : user_agent } self . ip_url = 'http://icanhazip.com/' self . logger = logging . getLogger ( 'gkp' ) retries = Retry ( connect = 5 , read = 5 , redirect = 5 ) self . agent = ProxyManager ( 'http://localhost:8118/' , retries = retries , timeout = Timeout ( total = 60.0 )) def renewTorIdentity ( self , passAuth ): try : s = socket . socket () s . connect (( 'localhost' , 9051 )) s . send ( 'AUTHENTICATE \" {0} \" \\r\\n ' . format ( passAuth )) resp = s . recv ( 1024 ) if resp . startswith ( '250' ): s . send ( \"signal NEWNYM \\r\\n \" ) resp = s . recv ( 1024 ) if resp . startswith ( '250' ): self . logger . info ( \"Identity renewed\" ) else : self . logger . info ( \"response 2: %s \" % resp ) else : self . logger . info ( \"response 1: %s \" % resp ) except Exception as e : self . logger . error ( \"Can't renew identity: %s \" % e ) def renew_connection ( self ): with Controller . from_port ( port = 9051 ) as controller : controller . authenticate ( 'natalie' ) controller . signal ( Signal . NEWNYM ) self . logger . info ( '*' * 50 ) self . logger . info ( ' \\t ' * 6 + 'Renew TOR IP: %s ' % self . request ( self . ip_url )) self . logger . info ( '*' * 50 ) def request ( self , url ): r = self . agent . request ( 'GET' , url ) if r . status == 200 : return r . data elif r . status == 403 : self . renew_connection () else : self . logger . error ( 'status %s ' % r . status ) return '' def current_ip ( self ): return self . request ( self . ip_url ) Now, with the help of the TOR, we are browsing internet with anonymity . TOR maintains a pool of IP addresses, but a renew request does not guarantee to generate a new IP. On top of this, some IPs were probably located on the moon because a request took forever , which on our end were a flashing timeout messages across screen. Internally we maintain a life counter on a connection and renew it when counter is up so we could return the IP back to the IP. TOR config The key to config the TOR was to enable ControlPort and set up HashedControlPassword . The password would be used when sending request to the local TOR service such as renewing a connection. TOR service would in turn pass that on to TOR network on our behalf. In /etc/tor/torrc: ## The port on which Tor will listen for local connections from Tor ## controller applications, as documented in control-spec.txt. ControlPort 9051 ## If you enable the controlport, be sure to enable one of these ## authentication methods, to prevent attackers from accessing it. HashedControlPassword 16 :872860B76453A77D60CA2BB8C1A7042072093276A3D701AD684053EC4C Password is created using TOR commandline . Privoxy config In /etc/privoxy/config , we set up a receiving port and a forwarding port. Forwarding port was set to 9050 as that's the default listening port by the TOR service. listen-address localhost:8118 forward-socks5 / 127 .0.0.1:9050 Phantom Now with the link between us and the target out of the way, we wanted to change our agent from a urllib brute force to a nicer consumer. Our goal was to drive a real web browser so our reading of the site is no different from a real user. Tapped into our experience with automated web testing, PhantomJS and Selenium were a natural choice for the job. from selenium import webdriver from selenium.webdriver.common.desired_capabilities import DesiredCapabilities class SeleniumUtility (): def __init__ ( self , use_tor = True ): self . ip_url = 'http://icanhazip.com/' self . logger = logging . getLogger ( 'gkp' ) dcap = dict ( DesiredCapabilities .
