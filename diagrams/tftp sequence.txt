note right
   data length = 0-511 bytes

client -> server: final ACK
note right
     Client can terminate its port right now.
     However, it is encouraged to
     wait for a while before terminating
     to ensure ACK is received by server.

     If received the last data packet again,
     then ACK has been lost.

server -> client: ACK (optional)
note right
     Server sends ACK responding to
     client's last ACK -- a final goodbye.
end note

== Error handling ==
ref over client, server
    Can ACK any packet (including ACK packets).
    Sender is not expecting any response.
