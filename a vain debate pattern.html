<p>I am amazed, that <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VZo8niQdWnE">财经郎眼</a> I used to enjoy so much which kept me
on tap with China's economic progress and debates, is nowadays plagued
with a BS culture and discussion pattern that I have <a href="https://fengxia41103.github.io/myblog/irresponsible response.html">witnessed</a>,
criticized, hated (no I don't hate this program, just the cliche
amplified by this 11/6/2017 episode on <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VZo8niQdWnE">新能源车 变革未来</a>.)</p>
<p>Where should I even start? The topic was about a
new <a href="http://finance.sina.com.cn/chanjing/cyxw/2017-06-15/doc-ifyhfhrt4301817.shtml">Chinese policy</a> that is to obsolete gasoline car and promote
electric cars. What bugs me is the fact that no one, I mean no one, on
the show and involved in this discussion said anything about
<strong>efficiency</strong> of energy conversion. They all stated the easy
<em>opinions</em>, environment protection, green life, obsoleting old
technology (and really!? who said, or proved, that gasoline car is an
old technology?  Isn't it again stated with an underline assumption
of <a href="https://fengxia41103.github.io/myblog/mature tech.html">mature technology</a>?), and how we, China, could yet again lead
the <em>next wave</em> in technology, and automobile has long been seen as
the symbol of the start of America's industrial dominance &mdash; the
high gear version of a terrible system called capitalism. So we could
lead the march to a new form of automobile, wow, that's like another
God's sign posted on the side of the road says, "yes you are the one,
you are made to replace America as #1. Look, you are replicating his
success! so that must be on the right path."</p>
<p>Geee!!! Come on people! When you are so hung up on the idea that
critical path to success in electric car is battery technology, and
throwing in a few lines that government should step in to build
infrastructure so there is charging station available for drivers'
convenience, it pisses me off in a number degrees beyond frustration.</p>
<h1>battery's power is not, free</h1>
<p>First of all, yes battery is the critical path. But no, let's take one
step further on this &rarr; the key issue here is <strong>not about battery
vs. gasoline</strong>, it is <strong>electricity vs. gasoline</strong>. In other words,
it is really a comparison of two super duper complicated industries:</p>
<ol>
<li>power station + transmission + battery + engine</li>
<li>oil + transmission + combustion + engine</li>
</ol>
<p>So to comprehend the benefit (or con) of either side, one needs to
consider the whole nine yard of electricity generation from coal,
hydraulic power, wind, solar, nuclear, to a heated water pump that
drives a GIANT engine in an power plant, all the way to that little
tiny bit locked inside your battery, versus a <strong>completly similiar</strong>
breakdown of technology chain but using, transporting a different
material. If you ever study high school physics, energy is constant,
just different form.</p>
<p>People are talking about the power stored in battery as if it came for
free!! Nuts! The electrical power came from somewhere, and there is a
cost associate with it, and I'm not talking about the cost of $0.50
per watt you pay on your electricity bill, I'm talking about this
industrial supply chain that convert a raw material to a form that
will drive the wheels. So really, regardless which material to choose
from, it's the <strong>efficiency of this chain</strong> matters, not the last link
of battery!</p>
<blockquote>
<p>In other words, if you suck in the current chain (which, as matter
of fact, is a lot mature than the one you are proposing), then your
odds of doing well in the new chain is pretty slim, too.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Even to the extent of these people's favourate argument to support
electric car &mdash; green. Well, the true comparison has to be an
aggregation of power station pollution versus. oil refinery pollution,
for the least. And you know what, don't we all agree that both are
nasty, equally evil, industry, that no one wants to have it in his
backyard!? If so, how can you just throw in a buzz word (again, I hate
people using <a href="https://fengxia41103.github.io/myblog/sharing economy.html">buzz word</a> like this!) and think all the old problems
would now go away!? No, they will not go away, unless you address them
diligently and <strong>efficiently</strong>. Otherwise, I can bet that you are just
swapping one set of problems with another, just that the other set you
don't know much about yet &larr; this is truly an example of <strong>the
happiness of the ignorance</strong>!</p>
<h1>Same gravity</h1>
<p>Second, can you just drop the fantasy of the 中国玩法!? This is
absolutely a conspiracy theory now that just because the US and Europe
lead the technology race (as of today), so anything business model or
standard or theory must be inherently bad for China, so and so that
China has to control its own destiny by leveraging their lust for its
market to come up a new game rule!? Does it make you feel safe now!?
Really, I can understand in many levels why a country wants to do
that, but one should also admit there are fundamental principles that
apply to all human, all societies. I seriously wonder that rolling
back a few hundred years should China also acclaim that its gravity is
<em>very different</em> from <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gravity_of_Earth">9.8</a> thus Newton's laws just don't apply!?
Get a grip! There is a reason why western is leading the technology
race &mdash; it had a first mover advantage, of course, but truly it's
the attitude of being practical, being critical, and less BS that give
them the advantage. Especially when we face the question of
efficiency, science, technology, really, there is one set of physics
rules that are universally true, and one should continue to challenge
it, to test it, to gain better understanding of it so to find out when
it falls short. But having a moral cry with excitement that "look, the
new Chinese way!", is just fxxxx BS.</p>
<h1>Be conservative</h1>
<p>I have observed this pattern many times over that is crazily prevalent
in China and its elite circle these days. I call it the <strong>view of
being a competitor rather than being a contributor</strong>. China elites
keep thinking in term of a race and competition in which winner takes
it all. They should instead think how their experiments and trials
could help to eliminate unknown path and to contribute to the pool of
this overall interesting, seemingly beneficial, and humanely
progressive topic. If they truly believe in the future of a wide
adoption of this technology that can make people's life better, they
should be extremely critical of its risk and problems, because if you
truly care about people, you don't see shinning $$ signs or benefits
written all over, you see how painful and struggling someone's life
can be affected, and how agonizing that will be to one's soul, to
yours.</p>
<h1>Leave government alone</h1>
<p>Last, the baby cry that government should step in to do this, do
that. I think any idea is going to fly if the government steps in to
build an infrastructure for you, to eliminate tax, to ban all your
competitors, and so on.... this is baby talk! Chinese business people
are not entrepreneurs at all, they want government backup for
EVERYTHING! Who doesn't like a risk free business!? I know I will. But
then, don't label yourself pioneer, or business man, or
innovator... you are not! You are not even a follower. You just want
both, 当了婊子还要立牌坊, disgusting! Put those charging stations as a
sunk cost on your budget sheet, if you have one, factor in tax
benefits and potential loss, hone in your development and production
to make quality, efficient product, fight your competitors till one is
dead, and accept a lost battle with grace and regrets that there were
many many points you could have done better, differently, that may
have changed the outcome. Then, if given a chance, try again, if
that's still your passion to do. But mixing your grand, wonderful
business plan with a line saying government should have prepared the
stage for me... well, then I already know you will point a finger to
the government also when it doesn't work. It's just convenient, and
honestly, you didn't believe this so called <em>great stuff</em> yourself
either, you just want to profit off others' belief. Shame.</p></p>
