Who said it first, that the difference between human and other animals
is that human can **make belief**, that we can imagine things, a
scenario, a life, that does not exist. Therefore we invented arts,
movies, music, literature &larr; all the existence that human can be
proud of, and the only things that human bring to this world which are
not put there by nature or God, are these imaginary things, make
belief.

I start to seriously wonder whether this speaks the fundamental truth
of being, of what I feel, what I puzzle about, and what I sense.

Walking back from gym, bright sunny day. Listening to this song,
[Night in Ulaanbaatar][1], I couldn't tell anymore I was walking in
light, or in darkness &mdash; the lights were blinding, barely any
breeze, but comfortable dry air and comfortable temperature. Yet, my
mind can only feel the wind, a breeze over the night of this remote
city, which I have never been, and may will never be, 袅袅炊烟,
sparsed lights here and there, a city that may only resemble the days
in the 80s of China, and this song, lingering over the sky, like a
radio wave, only the ones whose heart is receptive to it, hear.

Without you I would never have heard of this song, nor would ever be
sitting here writing down these thoughts as if someday you would still
be able to read this, and know my days and my mind. How scared I am
when thinking that we will forever be apart, being ignorant to each
other's life, happy or sad. I know by the end of life it doesn't
really matter at all. I don't even know whether I will have any sense
of feeling left when I get to 80s &mdash; will I be numb to emotion?
will I still, regret? will I still, tear? will I still, get sad? 

I wish I do. Really. With them, I can still feel, feel life; without
them, I would hate myself.

So here it is, a song that zoomed me right back to the days, when you
first told me about it, night or day, it is only meaningful,
beautiful, because of you.
