    <h1 class="myhighlight">Philosophy</h1>

  <ol id="toc" class="row"></ol>

  <div>
    <div id="article-content">
      <p><p>These are notes of philosophy, which I'm finding more and more
fascinating. Starting w/ simple reading of different thinkers, I'm
hoping I will be able to develop a connection between popular
propaganda to its philosophical origin &larr; not that these
propaganda were rooted in philosophy, but they have been dressing
themselves up to sound <em>philosophical</em> by echoing thinkers' thoughts,
thus making people <em>believe</em> they are deep &mdash; the propaganda is
still BS, the thinker's thoughts are indeed, deep. So it is an act of
camouflage.</p>
<h1>Siddhartha Gautama (Buddha)</h1>
<ul>
<li>
<p>He was neither a messiah nor a prophet, and he did not act as a
  medium between God and Man. His ideas were arrived at through
  reasoning not divine revelation, and it is this that marks Buddhism
  out as a philosophy as much as a religion. His quest was
  philosophical &mdash; to discover truths &mdash; and he maintained
  that these truths are available to all of us through the power of
  reason.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The four noble truths<sup id="fnref:5"><a class="footnote-ref" href="#fn:5">5</a></sup>:</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>Suffering is an <strong>inherent part of existence</strong> from birth,
   through sickness and old age, to death &rarr; the truth of
   suffering (Dukkha).</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The cause of suffering is <strong>desire</strong>: craving for sensual
   pleasures and attachment to worldly possessions and
   power &rarr; the truth of the origin of suffering (Samudaya).</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Suffering an be ended by <strong>detaching oneself</strong> from craving and
   attachment &rarr; the truth of the ending of suffering
   (Nirodha).</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The Eightfold Path (right action right intention, right
   livelihood, right effort, right concentration, right speech,
   right understanding, and right mindfullness) is the means to
   eliminate desire and overcome the ego &rarr; the truth of the
   path to the ending of suffering (Magga).</p>
</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li>
<p>Sensual pleasures and luxury we indulge in to relieve suffering is
  rarely satisfying, and that when it is, the effects are
  transitory... the experience of extreme asceticism (austerity and
  abstinence) equally dissatisfying &rarr; there must be a <strong>middle
  way</strong> between self-indulgence and self-mortification.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Nothing in the universe is self-caused, for everything is the result
  of some previous action, and each of us is only a transitory part of
  this eternal process &mdash; ultimately impermanent and without
  substance. So in reality, there is no "self" that is not part of the
  greater whole &mdash; or the "not-self" &mdash; and suffering
  results from our failure to recognize this. This does not mean that
  we should deny our existence or personal identity, rather that we
  should understand them for what they are &mdash; transient and
  insubstantial. Grasping the concept of being a constituent part of
  an eternal "not-self", rather than clinging to the notion of being a
  unique "self", is the key to losing that attachments, and finding a
  release from suffering.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Nirvana, the ultimate goal of life on Earth is to be the ending of
  the cycle of suffering (birth, death, and rebirth) into which we are
  born.<sup id="fnref:6"><a class="footnote-ref" href="#fn:6">6</a></sup></p>
</li>
</ul>
<h1>Confucius</h1>
<blockquote>
<p>The superior man does what is proper to the station in which he is;
he does not desire to go beyond this.</p>
</blockquote>
<ul>
<li>
<p>He seeks constants in a world of changing, and for his this meant as
  search for moral values that could enable rulers to govern
  justly.<sup id="fnref:3"><a class="footnote-ref" href="#fn:3">3</a></sup></p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Faithfulness and </strong>sincerity<strong> are shown in traditional </strong>rituals
  and ceremonies &rarr; these qualities in these settings allow
  <strong>virtue</strong> to become <strong>visible</strong> &rarr; virtue is then made
  <strong>manifest</strong> in the world &rarr; virtue can then <strong>be seen</strong> by
  others &rarr; others are <strong>transformed</strong> by virtue &rarr;
  faithfulness and sincerity hold the power of <strong>transformation</strong>.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Before him, the world had been explained by mythology and religion,
  and power and moral authority were generally accepted to be
  god-given. According to <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Analects">Analects</a>, we humans are the agents
  that Heaven has chosen to embody its will and to unite the world w/
  moral order &larr; this part is the same as traditional view.</p>
<p>However, 德(virtue) is not something Heaven-sent for the ruling
classes, but something that can be cultivated &mdash; and
cultivated by anyone. </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>To reconcile the fact that society is a rigid class system w/ this
  德 that all men can receive, he argues that virtuous man is not
  simply one who stands at the top of the social hierarchy, but one
  who understands his place within that hierarchy and embraces it to
  the full.</p>
<p>How to act virtuously: 忠孝礼术 &larr; who sincerely observes
these values are 君子. </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>忠 (faithfulness) is the guiding principle, 5 relationships, in order:</p>
<ol>
<li>sovereign &mdash; subject: rulers should be benevolent, and subjects
   loyal.</li>
<li>father &mdash; son: parent is to be loving, and a child
   obedient.</li>
<li>husband &mdash; wife: husbands are to be good and fair, and
   wives understanding.</li>
<li>elder brother &mdash; younger brother: an elder sibling is to be
   gentle, and younger siblings respectful.</li>
<li>friend &mdash; friend: older friends are to be considerate, and
   younger friends reverential.</li>
</ol>
<p>Such hierarchy reflects is significant because it reflects the
fact that each person should know his station in society as a
whole, as well his place in the family and the clan.</p>
<p>How to manifest that one knows his place in society? &rarr; 孝
(filial piety) &rarr; it's more than just respect one's parents or
elders. It reinforces the relationship of inferior to superior,
which was the central to his thinking.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>礼 (ritual propriety) is the outward signs of an inner 德,
  eg. ceremonies of marriage, funerals, and sacrifices to the
  etiquette of receiving guests. **It is only a sign of 德 when
  performed with sincerity. </p>
</li>
</ul>
<blockquote>
<p>Sincerity becomes apparent. From being apparent, it becomes
manifest. From being manifest, it becomes brilliant. Brilliant, it
affects others. Affecting others, they are changed by it. Changed by
it, they are transformed. Only he who is possessed of the most
complete sincerity that can exist under Heaven, can transform.<sup id="fnref:4"><a class="footnote-ref" href="#fn:4">4</a></sup></p>
</blockquote>
<ul>
<li>
<p>One can learn to become a superior man by first recognizing what one
  does not know (echoing Socrates that his wisdom la in accepting that
  he knew nothing!), and then by watching other people &larr; if they
  show virtue, try to become their equal; if they are inferior, be
  their guide.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The Golden Rule of "do as you would be done by" appears as a
  negative in Confucius &mdash; "what you do not desire for yourself,
  do not do to others" &mdash; <strong>Confucius does not prescribe what to
  do, only what not to do</strong>, emphasizing restraints rather than
  action.  This implies modesty and humility &mdash; values
  traditionally held in high regard in Chinese society. Fostering
  these values is a form of loyalty ot oneself and another kind of
  sincerity.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<h1>Heraclitus</h1>
<blockquote>
<p>You can never step into the same river twice<sup id="fnref:2"><a class="footnote-ref" href="#fn:2">2</a></sup>.</p>
<p>The road up and the road down are the one and the same.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Everything is flux.</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>It is the balance of opposites, such as day and night and hot and
  cold that leads to the unity of the universe, or the idea everything
  is part of a single fundamental process or substance &mdash; the
  central tenet of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Monism">monism</a>.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Tension is generated between these pairs of opposites &rarr;
  everything must be in a permanent state of flux, or change &mdash;
  day changes into night, which in turn changes back again to day.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<h1>Parmenides</h1>
<p>All is one.</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>He employs <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Deductive_reasoning">deductive reasoning</a> in an attempt to uncover the
  true physical nature of the world.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>From the premise that something exists ("It is"), Parmenides deduces
  that it cannot also not exist ("It is not"), as this would involve a
  logical contradiction &rarr; a state of nothing existing is
  impossible &mdash; there can be no void.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Everything that is real must be eternal and unchanging, and must
  have an indivisible unity &mdash; "all is one".</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>He shows by his process reasoning that our perception of the world
  if faulty and full of contradictions &rarr; we can never rely on the
  experience that is delivered to us by our senses.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<h1>Protagoras (a Sophist <sup id="fnref:1"><a class="footnote-ref" href="#fn:1">1</a></sup>)</h1>
<blockquote>
<p>Many things prevent knowledge, including the obscurity of the
subject and the brevity of human life.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Man is the measure of all things.</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>It is spring day in Athens &rarr; A visitor from Sweden says <strong>the
  weather is warm</strong>; a visitor from Egypt says <strong>the weather is cold</strong>
  &rarr; Both people are speaking the <strong>truth</strong>. &rarr; The truth
  depends on <strong>prospective</strong> and is therefore relative. &rarr; Man is
  the measure of all things.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Belief is subjective, and it is the man holding the view or opinion
  that is the measure of its worth... This relativism also applies to
  moral values, such as what is right and what is wrong. To
  Protagoras, nothing is inherently good in itself. Something is
  ethical, or right, only because a person or society judges it to be
  so.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Also, it shifted focus of philosophy away from an understanding of
  the nature of the universe to an examination of human behavior.</p>
</li>
</ul>

<p>Confucius's teachings make a lot of sense when viewed in its

<p>However, I think this reasoning is inherently flawed. By stating
"the most", it implies that there could only be <strong>one man</strong> fits
such role, thus automatically ruling out all could become 君子.

<li id="fn:5">
<p>I like this, a clean layout of reasoning &mdash; definition of
problem (suffering), analysis (cause of suffering), solution (how
to end suffering), roadmap of execution of solution (eightfold
path). Brilliant!&#160;<a class="footnote-backref" href="#fnref:5" title="Jump back to footnote 5 in the text">&#8617;</a></p>
</li>
<li id="fn:6">
<p>Wow, so the idea of rebirth is actually a sign that you are
going to suffer, again! How this is the opposite of popular beliefs!&#160;<a class="footnote-backref" href="#fnref:6" title="Jump back to footnote 6 in the text">&#8617;</a></p>
