This is to keep track what Noah says these days, some smart
remarks. But first of all, let me vent what this kid is like, this
morning, that was totally pissing me off!! &mdash; so I was cleaning
his glasses the last minute before leaving for school bus. There is
this missing piece off one of the legs, looked like the plastic has
been burned off by fire. So I asked what happened to it, he replied:

1. "I chewed it off." "But why!?" "**I had this sudden desire to chew
   it.**" Said calmly and unshamefully. WTF!
   
     So here goes the first line of his I'm writing down. So him.

2. Commenting on the new badminton coach he had in class. "This guy is
   all about power." "Oh so he was a power player. That's good."  "Not
   really. **Sometimes power has to bow to wisdom.**" &mdash; very
   philosophical, isn't it!?
