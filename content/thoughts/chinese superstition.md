Browsing Zhihu is depressing these days. Constantly I came across
titles which I could only call, thus the title, **chinese
superstition**. Not only that many there are indeed superstitious in
the conventional sense, but that the brainwash education and
propaganda have further done damage that there are some only could be
called _urban legend_ are now being thrown around as fact, or at least
as some strong evidence to back up a statement, which then by the
nature of these evidence being so shaky or outwright false, is itself
a logical result of a faulty reasoning that is worthless. Yet, just
like a lie or a scam could still fool many, or maybe even to _fool
some of the people all of the time_, they are received w/ ardor
defenders, and supported by countless referrals.

Since this is quite a phenomenon, I'd like to keep a note here, just
for the fun of it.

## Conclusion in shape of a question

This is a common practice, that a statement/opinion is posted in shape
of a question, eg. "为什么说中华文明对世界的贡献远大于西方文明". Don't
be fooled by the "why". It has nothing to do w/ seeking an
answer. Rather, it is a clear statement w/ a comparison (it always has
a "A is better than B" frame!), which the author is already
opinionated. Thus, the comments could only be a heated argument that
one side debates another.

This makes me wonder, what is a question? I don't want to use the word
"good" because an adjective makes this even harder to answer. A
question, in my mind, should be a phrase seeking a _truth_ of
something. It should be neutral, taking no side yet one way or
another, but focus on the _thing_ at hand, the phenomenon, the
symptom, the known. I don't know whether you absolutely can not ask a
sided question like this. If this is indeed the point you are seeking
more insights, I think this is just as valid. However, they are not
genuine when seen on those Chinese forums &mdash; they are simply a
provocative line that fans a flame. This actually reminds tactics of
both the Nazi's and those professional revolutioners'. If so, then
this again casts a shaddy shadow on such question forms. Sometimes it
makes me wonder why Nazi and communist so look alike!? Genetics?

## 中华

It's pretty funny how Chinese are considering this word
indisputable. I disagree. First of all, this is pretty much a racial
term in their mind because it certainly extends way beyond the scope
of geography. Dragged in a time axis, this term can include anything
that has a faint hint of an intercourse w/ anything they consider to
be their own. Like Decarte's "therefore I am", they need a single
anchor to start a whole universe. Thus, as long as they can find such
an anchor, which by way are plenty to grab, some solid and some bogus
(which I will touch upon in other sections), they can extend its reach
to infinity and beyond.

Just look at the three categories they love the most: racial,
geographical, cultural.

First, geo. This is the easiest to visualize. As long as you ever put
a single toe on the soil of anywhere between the old and/or new of its
border, it's a 中华 by definition. This makes it convenient then that
using the largest ever map would be beneficial. So by this thread
Roman could pretty much declare quite some _Roman descendants_, the
Great Britian could say half of world is still Great Britian, and the
most strong support for Chinese is, Mongols. Thanks for their effort,
the world was either Chinese or influenced (**always in a beneficial
way, of course**) by the Chinese.

Second, racial. If Mongol had European look, that could have spoiled
the fun. But how wonderful! Instead of Chinese being categorized as a
Mongo look, it's turned around that Mongo is nothing but a strain in
the overall 中华 race. This concept, 中华, will have hard time to fly
if racial difference is, obvious &rarr; it's far fetched already to
call all the 56 races 中华 despite that Uyghur people apparently look
more central Asian than 中华 residents. So even though Mongo invaded
Europe, thanks to their different racial profile, they have to wait
even today to be included as 中华. Sorry. But other than that, China
is pretty taking itself as the sole gene pool for the entire Asia!
Even though seagoing wasn't China's forte, but hell, sperms could
swim, right!? Why can't they swim around the Atlantic and make
everywhere 中华. So they must have.

Thirdly, cultural. Well. This is a catch-all. Geo could be seen on
planet earth. Race has definition. But cultural, particular if using
their term, the "influenced by", has no boundary. What makes a 中华
culture? what is not? and how can anything **not to be influenced**
by, anything!? This way of thinking has just manifested recently in
its Covid time when China made up the term "时空传染" &larr; just like
culture, it passes in the air, in your dream... &mdash; the key is,
you can't prove innocent. Period.

There you have it, the 中华. I'm pretty sure Martians were influenced
by 中华, also. Just wait till they show up so I could prove it to you.

## 中华文明

This, as always used in the context of the four ancient civilization,
which accordingly was promoted by 梁启超, is a super weapon of
nationalism.

First, it's recent but appears hold. His days, February 23, 1873 –
January 19, 1929. So giving 20 years to maturity, we are looking at
this line being put out around 1893 or later. Yet, this is freely
quoted as if this was written by Jesus, stamped approval by
Buddha, and carved in stone by Gia herself. While Zhihuers sneers at
US for its _short_ history, they don't think twice a phrase less than
half US's age is, undependable!

Second, [civilization][1]. This is a total misnomer. It's focus is on
the have vs. have-not. As long as you have those categories you are a
civilization. Whether it's a _good_ one or _bad_ one, hard to
tell. Therefore, I think there is nothing be proud of simply because
China is a civilization. Just watched a document the other day on
Aztec civilization, in which a captured warrior was tied to pole w/ a
rope while fighting to his death w/ other warriors &mdash; he was to
be sacrificed to winner's god, in a slow, bloody way. It's a
civilization, alright. But it's disgusting.

文明, is meant for something nice, pleasant, satisfying. However, I
found little such traits in Aztec's civilization, nor in the 中华文明.

## 西方<blank>

I don't know whether it's Kant or Hague who must make the world A
vs. B. It's definitely Nazi's way, so is today China's. It's starting
from annoying to now nonsensical that any dimension could be split
along the line of 东方 vs. 西方, whereas 东方 could be further tied to
a **Chinese influence** which I have talked about earlier in 中华
section. Therefore, the split is conveniently becoming China vs. 西方.
But I would say, doing so is to China's disadvantage.

First, 西方 is much bigger than China. It's pretty obvious that
counting by any dimension &mdash; land, population, resource &mdash;
`(world - China)` is greater than `China`. Period. Carving the world
like is even sillier than the Pope carving the globe for Spain and
Portugal, which, btw, was in 1494. 529 years later, China still thinks
this way.

Second, competition instead of collaboration. Once you draw a line
between mine and theirs, how are you to benefit from theirs if theirs
are good? Only one of two ways now, take or steal, and that's exactly
what China is doing these years. When science has brought the entire
mankind out of dark age, having such a view could only hurt your own
chance of survival. Stupid.

Third, who is the barbarian? Deep down in their brainwash scheme, it's
pretty funny that you would find ancient Greek in its action &mdash;
the world has two groups of people, the Greeks, and the
barbarians. China thinks they are the Greeks. I'm quite sure those
barbarians were joking about those Greeks being monkeys, too. What
this reveals is a self-centered view point that was valid 2000 years
ago, but trashy in 2023.

## 5000 years, and continuous

This is the Chinese superstition in the making. 5000!? wouldn't 4999
be a better one by Chinese taste?

First, archaeology hasn't proved it. All culture have some mythology
that start with the origin of human, and of course, them being the
direct bloodline of that.
But counting your calendar by that is for
maniacs. Who takes it to heart that Jesus was born exactly on the 0
year of our calendar, conveniently or coincidentally!? It's nothing
but a counter. But if you take it seriously, what a fool!

Second, non-broken. Well, if using any of the three 中华 threads, it's
perceivable that as long as there is human on earth, we could
certainly call it non-broken. After all, it's pretty much implied that
all human have one gene or two by China's origin, whatever it may
be. Mine is mine, yours is mine. Too bad China hasn't yet come up a
theory to conclude that Greeks were indeed migrants from, "China", so
that its history covers this planet end-to-end.

## why always me

This is inferior complex. Why 受伤的总是我. The 100 years of 屈辱 is
like a birth mark on every single Chinese today as if there is an
original sin. If pounding a children over and over to believe in
his/her deficiency at birth is criminal, then a government doing such
to its citizen is also a crime.

Now, like wearing a filter in front of eyes, this world is forever the
color of this filter. So, there is 总有人想害朕. The world is hating
China. US is targeting China. All are barbarians at gate, 图我的钱财或
是美貌.... so on and on. The bottom line is, I am always 对的.

Give me a fxxx break.
