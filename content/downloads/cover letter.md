Hi,

I love technology. I have been the primary architect for Lenovo Open
Cloud, which is an infrastructure for cloud computing and IoT
workloads. So this gives me insight to both hardware and software
stack that will be used to support them.

Further, I have a MBA and have built and managed projects in capacity
of a tech lead in a startup, a PM in a mid-size company, a Director of
a consulting firm that coordinates 40+ person team and a million
dollar contract, and a founder bootstraping my own business. These
experience gave me unique spectrum of understanding both of technology
and of its business value. I have found it necessary in role of
designing a quality architecture and development process. After all,
technology is not an isolation in vacuum. Instead, a good software and
its development is like writing a book -- you don't be a good writer
by just knowing how to write the letter, but by being a thinker in
life whose mind is curious, analytical, and productive.

I think I have much to offer to this position, shall there be mutual
interest in my background and quality. Looking forward to hearing from
you soon.

Best regards,
Feng Xia
