What is this? Suddenly, I feel this, sadness, inside me. Just
played/practiced two hours in this heat evening. Maybe it's the heat?
But why such a sadness? Because Noah is not here? No. It's not
that. The call to Aunt Tam after Uncle Tam passed away?
Probably. Hearing her voice is both making me less worried about her,
and worried, at the same time.

Listening to this video, the two stand up comedians, talked about
their divorce. I don't have any particular feel of any of the two,
yet, when they were reading letters written to each other, it felt,
pain. Yes, pain, a tremendous pain... I can't picture myself sitting
there to read out loud a letter addressed to me from someone so dear
in life, it will be, too hard.

I don't know. Maybe it reminds me my life. Maybe it's the heat, or the
evening, playing guitar always brings me through time, through space,
as if I were sitting on the stool looking at that remote hill w/ the
pagoda, it's a place so far far far away, but I'm glad I was there,
feel like it was long long long time ago, almost like watching a
movie, but which music to put on? I couldn't think of a song, not a
song, that would fit the tune, I don't know, it's a moment in life
that is dear, deeply buried, can not forget.

Maybe it's all of these, the stories, the people, the places I went,
the words I spoke, the sunsets I watched, the another-me at that
place, at that time. Life is indeed a sand in hand, dripping away, no
return, no pause, not even much of a start, nor an end, yea there is
an end to it, but it isn't death, really, I start to wonder maybe
there is an after life, or another life, or many many rounds of life
after, merry go around, but not a merry I guess, each round, is
another play unfold, another story to be told, another so many years
of pulling through, but having no past, nor future, just another
cycle, going around.

Sunset is as pretty as everyday. Heat wave is abating a little w/ some
gentle breeze. Life is not bad actually. Can't complain really. But
then, here, a cloud of sadness, inside, like the sky I'm looking at,
nothing special, but real... maybe I'm missing her again. Maybe, I
have nothing left, to shine.
