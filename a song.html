    <h1 class="myhighlight">A song</h1>
  </div>

  <ol id="toc" class="row"></ol>

  <div>
    <div id="article-content">
      <p><p>It's a morning that you are touched, by a song. Quite out of nowhere
when I was just flipping through Youtube trying to find something to
watch. Then there was <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MZqdlZ3juJI">this movie</a>, I probably have watched it
before. I can't remember when now. I don't even recall its tune. But
when the music was played, it echoed inside me &mdash; there were days
when I was walking on the bridge in 太原, thinking of the future and
Noah's mom, this tune was with me. At some point I actually thought it
was something quite beautiful and genuine and I wanted to write it
down before I forget. But now to think of it, it must have been there
all along since I watched the movie some time ago, just didn't surface
till this morning, or that day.</p>
<p>But the song made me think of you. I could feel it, could feel you
tossing around inside me as if you were just sleeping there. How
real. I think that's the power of music, or should I say the power of
missing someone, of loving someone, of wanting someone? Noah was a
great boy today. The day didn't start well for him &mdash; he played
his Prodigy and was happy, until I reminded him of his assignment due
in a few days and he needs to work on it. There was silence, heavy
silence. But then, he picked up his binder and started working on
it. I guess the homework must be quite reasonable because before we
hit I-40 exit he said he is all done! How wonderful!</p>
<p>I remember the night, the moment, when you were next to me, and Noah
was on your segway zooming around. That was a moment in life when I
felt complete, there was nothing I would have asked, nothing. If only
life could have ended at that moment, that would have been nice. Here
he is, growing, still a boy with lots of boyish thoughts and
mischievous ways. He will be fine. But what about you? where are you
these days? and what's your life like? and are you happy?</p>
<p>I don't know how many times you fly through my mind each day. A lot, I
think. Listening to this song I felt this urge to tear, to miss the
ones I have missed in life, the ones who are here no more. I wonder,
maybe that's how one should count his/her age &mdash; by counting how
many lives one has seen its end.</p>
<p>I miss them, Lei, 波波, 臭豆腐, and all the lost loves that had once
bestowed on me, but not anymore. Is this fate? destiny? It is
interesting that last night I came across a line in the <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Why-West-Rules-Now-Patterns/dp/0312611692">book</a>,
which says Buddha is meant to break the cycle of rebirth because life
= suffering. So the idea, I guess, is that once you are out of this
vicious cycle, your suffering ends and that's when you are
<em>saved</em>.</p>
<p>Sometimes I truly feel this is probably how it should go, cause life
certainly is not easy. Then there are all the love vows one makes to the
other person that <em>if not this life, I vow to try again in the next,
and one following till we are together, then we will never part</em>. How
touching! If looking from this Buddha lens, what this vow says is
an incredible commitment, <strong>that I'm willing to go through another cycle of
life, to suffer, to live through, and may there be even more of these
rounds, because I want to meet you, see you again, and love you
again</strong>. </p>
<p>This is indeed a noble thought. You are giving up chance to be saved
in order to fulfill a love you feel about another person (but if you
think of it, how do know s/he has not quit the cycle and has bee saved
already?) well, it does make sense though, maybe that's exactly why
there are people feeling they are not finding the one they want &larr;
because that person has been saved and is not in this cycle anymore!
Oh mine, that's just disappointing, isn't it? Then what? I guess from
what I know about Buddha, the only option now is to save yourself as
quickly as possible so you could join her in that saved land (suppose
the saved are going to the same place. nirvana? heaven? or even hell?
does it matter then if your objective is to find that person and be
with her? even if the place is called hell or whatever, I think it's
irrelevant.)</p>
<p>So here it is, a lovely lovely song. I'll hymn it for you, my love,
someday, in some life:</p>
