    Looking back, one thing I start to realize is that one
    needs little to live, but much to remeber. I can now
    live off a small box of clothes, a bed on the floor, and
    some dime books to read.
  </p>
  <p>
    Then, there are persons I care to think of and to miss,
    and moments of sorrow and joy, that became memory,
    living its own course, just won't go away.

    IMP Japan, 2007
  </h6>

  <p align="right">
    A hurricane came, rained for two days. Study
    was intense and uninterrupted. It were the days filled with
    ambition, self-importance, glamour, and hope.
  </p>

Note:

1. Passing storm created a beautiful tranquility when dreams,
   ambitions, and peace of mind collide.

2. For the first time seeing
   the Pacific in such a close range. The glimmering reflections on
   water made everything surreal as if they were created in a Japanese
   anime. I don't recall the smell of the fresh air, or the sound of
   seagulls, or the horn of the ships on the horizon anymore. But the
   blue, the crystal, transparent, blue, and a sense of peace,
   tranquility, and intimacy, is lingers along.

Note:

1. Tian Wentong's dad. This was taken in 2006 when the darkness
   overshadowed the house and the family. Read his will when
   preparing one for dad, then realized how great soul one can be,
   for what he had in the will was gentle, selfishless,
   determined.

2. I think at the end of one's life, there isn't really much to
   glorify or to recall, but a humble existence with feelings, a bit
   fear in the face of death, and a bit relief for completing the
   journey has been given.
