Warm day, getting to low 60s, and felt rather like Spring if you sit
in the sun, a bit windy from time to time, I guess it's the cold air
and warm air swapping their places. It's nice feeling the warmth,
though it's rather out of season, and most branches are naked, just
the way they should be in Winter.

Reading [this book][1], a slow documentary of this rural place in
North Carolina, a book of stories that everyone of them is in their
70s, 80s, or 90s, it's a story book of the past, of a place and time
that have gone by, likely never will return.

I start to feel that everyone's life is actually a mix bag of places,
identities, trades, and not the least, times. In a way, everyone is
misplaced, somehow, into a space and a life that didn't feel s/he
belongs, but then, it went on, went through, became someone's life, or
part of it, and then, a story in a book somewhere, or maybe never be
told, and never to be heard, just came and then gone.

The first time I felt that way was during the gig in China
in 2014. Riding the shuttle bus to 阳泉, I distinctly remember it felt
like throwing myself into a tunnel, a black hole... not that the place
was bad, it was fine, a city setting, though not metropolitan, was
decent and busy... it was the time when I was going through the
breakup of marriage, didn't know what to do about it, so rather, just
put myself into an exile, traveling from US to 北京, then to 太原,
then onto this bus... I felt being placed into a space I never dreamed
of ever possibly be, yet, there I was, so the feeling was both real
and surreal... at the time I thought that was an interesting
sensation, or perhaps should call it an experience, that just served
as a distraction from the problem I was struggling with.

Yet, reading this book, I start to see that everyone's life, and I
could bet now on everyone's, anyone's, is just like that &mdash; a
mismatch of time and place, that the person would feel something isn't
right, but can't tell what it is... now I know what it is, it's this
feeling of misplacement, a person who would have lived that way, ended
up having had this way... mismatch? I can't say that no more now. What
happened is real, and that isn't mismatch... we may not want to have
had the thing happen to us the way it was, but it happened, and
whatever the days one had, that's THE version, the only version, there
is. So there isn't a misplacement at all. It's just, destiny, or fate,
or life.

I'm jealous that most of the folks in this book were content about
their days. Some had colorful life, some simple. I think once I hit
their age, I would be content as well. A life is long enough. Though
sometimes it felt short, I doubt I would ever want to be reborn and
relive one life again. We just travel through this mix bags of place,
time, things, people, then, coming out of it, is a life, no more, no
less. It's good enough.
