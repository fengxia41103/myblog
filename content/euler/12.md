# problem

[original post][1]

<div class="problem_content" role="problem">
<p>The sequence of triangle numbers is generated by adding the natural numbers. So the 7<sup>th</sup> triangle number would be 1 + 2 + 3 + 4 + 5 + 6 + 7 = 28. The first ten terms would be:</p>
<p style="text-align:center;">1, 3, 6, 10, 15, 21, 28, 36, 45, 55, ...</p>
<p>Let us list the factors of the first seven triangle numbers:</p>
<blockquote style="font-family:'courier new';"><b>&nbsp;1</b>: 1<br><b>&nbsp;3</b>: 1,3<br><b>&nbsp;6</b>: 1,2,3,6<br><b>10</b>: 1,2,5,10<br><b>15</b>: 1,3,5,15<br><b>21</b>: 1,3,7,21<br><b>28</b>: 1,2,4,7,14,28</blockquote>
<p>We can see that 28 is the first triangle number to have over five divisors.</p>
<p>What is the value of the first triangle number to have over five hundred divisors?</p>
</div>


# solution

[code][2].

* **problem space**: `< 500!`, but this is too much to iterate
* test criteria:
    1. is divisor of `n`?
    2. `> 500` divisors in total?

## find divisors

The dummy way to search for divisors of a number `n`. **Note** the
problem space of this is `sqrt` of `n`.

```python
def divisors(n):
    """Find all divisors given number "n".

    Note that problem space is sqrt(n) since factors
    will repeat themselves passing that point. This greatly reduced
    number of iteration needed.
    """
    i = 1
    while i * i <= n:
        if n % i == 0:
            yield [i, n / i]
        i += 1
```

## method 1

Brute force. One thing to note is the starting point. Knowing the
result is 12374, we could potentially see how we can manipulate the
starting value of `m` in order to reduce searching time &larr; this
is an after thought.

```python
def method_1(n):
    max_count = 0
    m = 10000 # we can guess this starting point by trial and error
    num = 0
    while max_count <= n:
        num = m * (m + 1) / 2
        all_divisors = reduce(lambda x, y: x + y, divisors(num))
        max_count = max(max_count, len(all_divisors))

        # test criteria
        if max_count > n:
            break

        # move on
        m += 1

    # print result
    print num, m - 1, max_count
```
