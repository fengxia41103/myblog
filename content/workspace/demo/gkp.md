Project GKP is a web application assisting high school
graduates in China research colleges.
The grand vision is to
make it a one-stop shop to get information that are mostly
relevant.

However, devil is in the details. What do you
want to know about a school? Certainly some description
of the school in general, maybe some meta data such as
the type of school, student count, year founded and such.
But also, what about subtle information such as campus life?
What represents this type of information?...
Discussion and research around these questions eventually
form the input that shapes this application.

Read on about its [core functions and design considerations][1].
