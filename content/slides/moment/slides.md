    Looking back, one thing I start to realize is that one
    needs little to live, but much to remeber. I can now
    live off a small box of clothes, a bed on the floor, and
    some dime books to read.
  </p>
  <p>
    Then, there are persons I care to think of and to miss,
    and moments of sorrow and joy, that became memory,
    living its own course, just won't go away.

    <h6>Kobe, 2007</h6>
    A hurricane came, rained for two days. Study
    was intense and uninterrupted. It were the days filled with
    ambition, self-importance, glamour, and love.
  </div>

Note:

1. Passing storm created a beautiful tranquility when dreams,
   ambitions, and peace of mind collide.

2. For the first time seeing
   the Pacific in such a close range. The glimmering reflections on
   water made everything surreal as if they were created in a Japanese
   anime. I don't recall the smell of the fresh air, or the sound of
   seagulls, or the horn of the ships on the horizon anymore. But the
   blue, the crystal, transparent, blue, and a sense of peace,
   tranquility, and intimacy, is lingers along.

    <h6>Uncle Tian</h6>
    Reading his will while drafting one for dad. It struck
    me what a noble soul he was. Wish I could have known him
    better. Thank you for having been in this world, and for
    having been part of this family. You will be remembered.
  </div>

Note:

1. Tian Wentong's dad. This was taken in 2006 when the darkness
   overshadowed the house and the family. Read his will when
   preparing one for dad, then realized how great soul one can be,
   for what he had in the will was gentle, selfishless,
   determined.

2. I think at the end of one's life, there isn't really much to
   glorify or to recall, but a humble existence with feelings, a bit
   fear in the face of death, and a bit relief for completing the
   journey has been given.

  <h6>Some thoughts</h6>
  <p>
    I like cameras, like looking at nice photos, mine and others'.
    I guess in general I just like beautiful things, people, mind.
    Sometimes you feel they are abundant. Looking around yourself,
    you see them everywhere, some obvious, some minute and subtle,
    but they all speak life, speak exquisite beauty.
  </p>
  <p>
    But then, there were times you felt the world around you was ugly,
    vain, boring, annoying, and little hopeful nor exciting. Time
    stood still, life itself was blocked, and there was no path in
    sight going forward. Ice was thick and closing in, and fire was
    burning out. How dreadful it felt!
  </p>
  <p>
    Picking up photography as a hobby was rather a vanity at the time
    when there was just an urge to spend $$ on yet another
    gadget. 2004 Nikon rolled out its D70 and I wanted it, looking
    forward to a trip to Beijing seeing my girlfriend at the time and
    showing off, like many many men have done, are doing, and continue
    doing. I don't regret the move in this hindsight, as it led me to
    this repository of memories and a mindset to observe things,
    however ordinary they appear to be, and be able to to discover and
    appreciate their wonder. I do regret it was driven by a showoff
    thought and I was picturing more of how to wow people with this
    equipment rather than the inner side of me. In the end, vanity
    fades, as it always does and always will. What's frozen on the
    screen, was a moment that I felt, I sensed, moved me &mdash; it
    was a reflection of the moment of myself, in time, in space.
  </p>
    
  <p>
    Flipping through them to make this album, I couldn't help
    feeling how lucky I have been, for having so many beautiful
    things and people accompanied my life, and entered my world,
    some close, some distant, some made me smile,
    some made me cry.
  </p>

  <p>
  **Adding them all up, here I am, for better and for worse, I am.**
    Wherever you are, whenever you are reading this or never or ever,
    thank you for giving what you gave me, for being part of my humble
    life. Memories are eternally beautiful; so are you, in my heart,
    forever a shining star. If our lives may across again, I remembered you,
    and wish you would remember me, too.
