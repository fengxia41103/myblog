We walked a lot today, all the way to the uptown, ground zero, Empire
State, then back to the Manhattan Bridge and back.  Then in the
evening we took a walk around Brooklyn. Watching people go by, sitting
here and there, all colors, all kinds, some in gym clothes, some
jogging, some heading home perhaps, some hanging out w/ friends, some
just wondering around, some w/ family, some look like a student, some
homeless or the like, walking by a couple gyms and see people
working out inside... noise, humming and talking and loud cars and
motorcycles, everywhere, w/ the backdrop a beautiful evening air
decorated by a magnificent hue of red in the sky, it felt, both
alive, and struggling.

In a city of over 10 million people, walking on the street, living in
this corner of the giant map, makes you feel insignificant, absolutely
nobody. Motorbikes for food deliveries are becoming a city scene, as
if I were in Shanghai. All these people, are living somewhere, making
a living somehow, doing something, trying (I suppose) to find him/her
self. It is overwhelming. For the first time I start to understand
that city life is a lot to take. Out of these 10 million people, what
is the odds you could meet someone who likes you also? I don't
know. There are plenty couples on the street, in restaurants, friends
chatting to each other, all dress well, all pretty to look at. Yet, I
feel it's a city of reality show almost, that they each holding onto
each other, so each feels not completely alone, feels belong to, even
though I don't know what that means, belonging to, what?

The city? the place? the people they know? career? dream?... what is
it? Why doing the work out in a gym on this street? For pleasing
yourself? Then what?... It's a need of an identity, that as a sand on
a beach, each still yearns to have one uniqueness whatever it may
be. So some have a loud card, some wear bright color, some work out a
bubble butt, some do this and that...

I was talking to Noah about how strange it will be that you could make
a name for yourself in a city like NYC, like "you are the best ___"
kind of thing. Then, I said, I do know the best badminton player in
NYC, the girl from whom I got 1 point, and what a highlight of my life
that was! So I guess it is possible to be known, though still, I don't
know how meaningful that is at all. Maybe she lives right here on this
block. Maybe she is walking around near me, sitting in a bar drinking
w/ friends, playing somewhere... another sand on the beach, even
though me, another sand also, knows her existence, and admires her
deeply.

How strange this is.
