This is to keep track what Noah says these days, some smart
remarks. But first of all, let me vent what this kid is like, this
morning, that was totally pissing me off!! &mdash; so I was cleaning
his glasses the last minute before leaving for school bus. There is
this missing piece off one of the legs, looked like the plastic has
been burned off by fire. So I asked what happened to it, he replied:

1. "I chewed it off." "But why!?" "**I had this sudden desire to chew
   it.**" Said calmly and unshamefully. WTF!
   
     So here goes the first line of his I'm writing down. So him.

2. Commenting on the new badminton coach he had in class. "This guy is
   all about power." "Oh so he was a power player. That's good."  "Not
   really. **Sometimes power has to bow to wisdom.**" &mdash; very
   philosophical, isn't it!?
   
3. 8:30 pm. Out of nowhere, after his Mom left for gym, he said to me,
   "爸，我决定了，等你有了517, 我和你住" "Why?" "Because I think it
   will be difficult living with her." "Why?" "So she bought snack
   without looking at the label, and it turned out to be wasabi
   flavored, and I was the first one eating it, and I didn't have
   water then..."  hahaha!! Poor little guy!! But I asked him whether
   he has other reasons for this decision, and he said, "第二， she
   gets up late, so there is increasing chance I'll be late for
   schoolbus."  "Anything else?" "Yes. I'm actually feeling scared by
   myself at home, though everytime I said I will be ok." "You mean
   when she goes to gym and leaves you at home?" "Yes" "Then tell her
   so next time." "ok" "I leave you for gym when you come with me in
   the office also." "But that's daytime."..... "Of course. You can
   come live with me anytime. I'll get you a key... wait, I'll
   introduce you to the concierge, so she will know you, and you can
   just come whenever you want."

4. 10:00 pm. Math, struggling w/ the concept of "20% off", which he
   subtracted `$0.2`. Why so? "So how much is 20%?" "It's 20 over 100"
   "So how much will that be?" "0.2, 20 cents". Speechless, isn't it!
