At age 50, I watched Oshin again, and found myself understand much of
this movie now. I remember the moments when my mom was in tears
watching this, and I couldn't understand at all why she would do
that. I was about Noah's age. Now, even without going through as much
as Oshin had, without suffering the pain of war, I could not help
knowing why it's so touching. What an epic, really, the misery of
life, of the era, of the terrible ordeal a human must go through, and
how fleeting a life really is. In the end, what is remaining? The
names would be all gone, forgotten, the stories buried, and who would
have ever remember there had been such a person, such an emotion, such
a struggle, be it a villain or a hero!?

I have been fortunate so far. Yet, I could feel the tie between theirs
and mine. Maybe it's the feeling of loss of someone you endear, love, or
something, or a moment which you could never live again.... it's
hard. Really. Life is a drama that is so full of surprise and regrets,
that it felt sometimes too long to bear, and sometimes too short to
dare. One keeps moving forward, day by day, not knowing what is ahead,
where is the end, yet one strives to be meaningful, happy,
satisfied.

Perhaps the only thing that is always meaningful, is the heart of
gold, to be kind, to give someone in distress a hand, to be grateful
if receiving such, and to live truthful to yourself. Dust to dust,
scattered in the wind, leaving no trace, but a feel.
