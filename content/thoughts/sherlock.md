Haven't been much a fan of Sherlock Holmes, but watched a [movie][1],
which in the days of [COVID19][2] all over the news and thoughts after
writing [virus is coming][3], what Sherlock said made me think more on
what marks a modern man &mdash; "There is no magic."

I have ranted many times that there is no magic in engineering, in
coding, in anything that is concrete, material, real. Life itself has
no magic, it's messy, lots of loose gears fitting together, with a lot
of trial and error, and a lot of luck. So, there isn't magic in
becoming a modern man.

What is a modern man? What makes one qualified as one? I don't have
answer, nor there is any better than what I will be laying out
below. Living in the 21st century gives a perception that everyone is
now a modern man, because we are all living in a _modern_ society,
most of us at least, and cold war is over, we haven't slaughtered in a
global sense since the WWII, and more people are educated w/ science,
w/ literature, w/ thinkings and philosophies and instant news and
instant gratification, from food to sex &rarr; hardly one can imagine
how much faster the pace of this modern life can become &larr; this,
is as efficient, as it can get. What's the next? A pill that replaces
food and drink? or one that makes you immortal? Sure. But eating a
burger is hardly much time wasting than swallowing a pill, not to
mention we eat burgers while doing other things, such as smart phone
or work or drive. So really, the trademark of a modern life, is
already here.

But, do all these make us a modern man? We all agree that a kid
growing to an age of 18 doesn't automatically makes him/her an adult
in the eyes of their parents, teachers, friends, or even
themselves. The law marks them so, but life disagrees. So the quality
of a modern man is not acquired by age either. Living in today's
world, watching TV, typing smart phones, say nothing about the state
of the mind that make the person a modern man. On the contrary, if you
watch their doings, many, I would say, fail to make the bar, and in my
mind, the bar says this:"**Be able to step outside yourself and look
from without, so to observe what yourself just said and did, and can
still agree with them.**" This, isn't easy.

The reality show of this CORVID19 is a case in point. China's patients
are ramping down, and the rest of the world (this is exactly how the
company divides the markets &mdash; China vs. the rest of the world,
how strange!) is ramping up. Chinese are now hailing their success,
while taking seats as if waiting for a thriller movie to start,
together with their pop corns in hand. But truly, regardless of
whether the episode has passed (which I think not). I believe all so
called 拐点 are bogus, and virus has nothing to do w/ wishful thinking
&mdash; we either understand their mechanics and know how to defend,
or not. There is nothing in between, and there is no luck in
between. This is much like physics &mdash; the rules have always been
there. It was human who were slow to grasp them. So we tried sun god,
Appolo, whoever driving the sun up and down, whoever makes the stars
go around in such a way. But it doesn't change them a bit, they go
around, based on the rules they have always been based on, however
human wish to explain. So will be the viruses. 

So what do we do? Keep calm, don't panic, be honest, and be
kind. However, did we? did they? Didn't they have the first reaction
that the people from Wuhan were so super selfish by escaping the city,
thus spreading the virus all over my neighbourhood? Didn't they wish
to quarantine the entire city, the state, while cheering for the
government's efficiency, so called 体制的优势, and even look down
others whose authorities don't have that power!? Didn't they
themselves become victim of a peace-time war zone, so lucky for those
fans of the 抗日神剧， that they got to experience them first-hand
what it was like 90 years ago, the dreamed about 民国， or end of the
Qing, that every of them wished to go back to!? But the sad thing is,
they went around w/ heroic stories of human sacrifices, while failed
to realize what they have been cheering for, what they have been
acting against, is the exact copy of the days when 麻风（Leprosy）
patients were treated like evils, HIV patients were shunned as moral
corrupted Satan agents, and Jews were sent to ghettos then the
concentration camps because they were the _tumor of modern society_
.... 

[Tolerance][4], is only possible when one is alarmed by the similarity
of these samples, by had a gut feeling of uneasiness when your own
thoughts echo these truly dark deeds that had happened in the past,
but didn't go away, and keep emerging over and over in different
disguises and slogans. If one fails to be sensitive to these signals,
one has already failed the bar to be a modern man &mdash; there is no
progress, no enlightenment, when one carries all the fancy handbags,
shoes, clothes, electronics, cars, what have you, while have no feel
of the wrongs advocated by oneself.

So, as long as the hope is still about a wishful thinking such as
those bogus predictions of 拐点， of herb medicine winning the day, of
how virus has moved on to other countries as if my turn of suffering
is now over, they are not modern man. They are ancient man living in
the past.
