Have you had this experience, that something you are familiar with,
suddenly slowed down, which made you feel that everything was in a
slow motion? 

I know, it sounds pretty strange, and it is indeed strange. On the way
to work this morning I was listening to
my [all time favourate movie][1], and for some reason I was playing it
in a 1.5x slower speed than normal, and how strange it all sounded!
The speech, the music, the vibes, all slowed down just a bit! I could
still tell the voices, plots, not like that the voice was changed to
some low tone when you play the records really really slowly. No. They
were pretty much intact, but you could sense the pace of it felt,
different.

It was quite an interesting experience. Then, cars going by. I suppose
they were driving in their normal speed, even they felt, slowed down
&mdash; the drivers were not _as aggressive as usual_, and the whole
rythm of life was on a slow track of some sort. It was a matrix
glitch.

I wouldn't think it will make much of a difference if you just played
a track for the first time. It's only the familiarity of thing that
has ingrained you with a certain **perception** which created this
disparity effect. So like everything else, it's your own perception
that got you think what is _normal_ and what is not. But in reality,
there isn't such a thing as being normal, it's all in your mind.

Dropped Noah at school this morning. On the way out I ran into Dana
and Jack. She said she _is_ leaving Lenovo. I suppose her meeting with
her new boss on Monday didn't go well. What a bummer! This is really
sad. Really. I never met the guy, but honestly, I have zero interest
meeting him or even talking to him. Just by looking at his
_professional_ profile gives me a fit, a young HR director in the 30s
and is _workholic_... but really, my experience with Chinese version of
workholic is that they work in low efficiency, has no vision
of the work they are working on, putting in no thoughts into how 
to make this work better because they are plainly told what to do so
they think they are doing the job just because they are doing what was
told. Often they have zero understanding (or worse, wrong
understandings) of the objective, and just blindly executing them
since the boss is the brain &mdash; just so wrong! There is no
crowd wisdom, no contribution, no discussion, no collaboration,
just command and **serfdom**.

Really. Even as a HR person, if his style is just telling ppl what to
do without asking, motivating, inspiring and encouraging, forget it,
he is in the **wrong** business, and whoever puts him in this position
has no fxxx clue what HR is about &rarr; it's not a management,
hello!!!? It's not hiring, training, filling a position where another
screw is needed. It's caring and monitoring and putting yourself into
others' pain and frustration at work, and trying to understand,
to balance, and to make ppl feel comfortable with where they are and
what they do. That's hard work because who wants to really understand
another human's problem and ambition and problems in life?

I don't know. This world is crazy. The BS ppl gets what they want by
elbowing other ppl aside, while rewards go to these bullies. It's a
Darwin's jungle. Sometimes I wonder whether this is also just my
perception, like the slow motion experience I just had this morning?
But, as of this moment, I think not. They are just BS ppl, and they
disgust me to the core, not because they are bad or anything, but
because they dress themselves up as if they are intelligent and
powerful and knowing what they are doing, while in my eyes they
are imbecile and coward that they took the easy way out by
shouting their want but no asking and interest of what they mean to
others.

So, fellas, if you ever come across my path that way, don't even slow
down. Just go as fast as you are preferring to, to your hell.
