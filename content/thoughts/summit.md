Summary: Spot a Chinese forum on Corvid-19 in WeChat, which says
         something about the mentality of the Chiense elite circle.

Saw something in WeChat which truly shocked me &mdash; "The 2nd Main Forum
of Corvid-19" hosted in Shanghai on March 29, 2020. Its agenda says:

| Time          | Description                    |
|---------------|--------------------------------|
| 15:00 - 15:03 | Openning video                 |
| 15:03 - 15:06 | Openning note by the organizer |
| 15:06 - 16:05 | Forum                          |
| 16:05 - 16:15 | Ending note by the organizer   |

What's in the forum:

> 1. Analysis of European Corvid-19 situation and its fatality rate
> 2. Corvid-19 ICU patient treatment
> 3. Analysis of challenges facing by the US
> 4. Analysis of challenges in Asia and solutions
> 

With the updated news rolled out everyday with climbing number of
patients all over the US, and the 3rd week staging at home in a
approximately lock-down of the entire country, it's rather laughable
for anyone to stand out on a forum like this as if s/he has all
figured it out &mdash; far from it, I'm afraid. The entire world is in
the mist of this pandemic, and we, yes, the capital **WE**, have not
yet figured it out, have not had much experience to announce a victory
in any fashion besides comforting ourselves that only that many people
have died, small number, don't worry. If any, the benefit of such
forum, or should I call it what it really is, a showoff, a brag, is to
counter a mass panic. However, I hardly read such intention from the
wording they have chosen on the poster. Even more annoyingly, it takes
time and effort to make such a poster and to organize such an event,
not to mention to first incubate such an idea when everyone else is
scraping the bottom of pants for necessities &mdash; it's a sign of
leisure, and most of all, of arrogance.

What's wrong with this country, and with these people? Even the
Corvid-19 is becoming nothing but a popular topic that creates 流量，
so all the internet celebrities are attaching to it so to share the
pot before it goes cold!? Indeed Max had it right that by given 200%
profit, capitalist dares to stomp any conscience under their feet,
including their own.

This is quite disturbing, and disappointing. China has evolved much
over the last 40 years in term of material wealth. However, the people
and its elites have fallen behind &mdash; they have been too busy
scooping up gold in sand, and had no time to reflect, and cowardly
avoiding comparing themselves to their western peers in scope and in
depth. This, is like a shower signer enjoying himself &mdash; hmmm, I
sound really good, don't I? and that's what the true spirit of this
forum.
