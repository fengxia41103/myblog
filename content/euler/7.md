[code][2].

Another prime number problem.

* **problem space**: much greater than 10001. I would think prime
  numbers are spaced out further and further when moving away from 2.
* **test criteria**:
    1. is prime?
    2. is the 10001st one?

Since we have done primality test in [problem 3][3], the easiest way
is simply counting how many primes we got:

```python
def main():
    n = 10001
    count = 1
    i = 3
    while count < n:
        if is_prime(i):
            count += 1
        i += 2

    print '%dth prime is' % n, i - 2
```

Note that we start with `i=3` so we have skipped counting `2` and
`3` &rarr; thus the correct counter is `i-2`.

# analysis

How (un)linear are prime numbers found within natural numbers? Using
the first 10,000 of them for a quick analysis surprisingly reveals
that they are quite `linear` with small jigzags but not much.
