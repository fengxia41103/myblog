&lt;p&gt;Post go-live, and I'm almost, dead. It was so tiring over the N-1 and
cutover weekend, that I start to feel my age, and my passion of
working for the public sector is melting. I admire the dedication
everyone put in during this period, especially for folks who I never
thought would have picked up the ball and run so quickly. Without them
I would not imagine the system would haven even survived!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But, there were many things turned me off, also &amp;mdash; teams who had
an easy time because they had a much longer leadway into the cutover,
did almost, nothing. Nothing in the sense that they simply squandered
the time saved, continued to operate as if the system is already
perfect and they had achieved the goal, thus simply stopped working on
it. They credited themselves of the performance without realizing that
they did not, I do mean they did not, create what they had! The vendor

&lt;p&gt;Post go-live, and I'm almost, dead. It was so tiring over the N-1 and

&lt;p&gt;But, there were many things turned me off, also &amp;mdash; teams who had

did almost, nothing. Nothing in the sense that they simply squandered
the time saved, continued to operate as if the system is already
perfect and they had achieved the goal, thus simply stopped working on
it. They credited themselves of the performance without realizing that
they did not, I do mean they did not, create what they had! The vendor
did 90% of the work, while they played along, inherited the working
copy, and mistakenly thinking they had done a good job. Not
surprised then that their side of the world continue to receive errors
and even blockers! I'm disappointed how an engineer has no initiative
to make things, perfect! Isn't the urge that makes one a good
engineer!? Isn't a professionalism is like? Yet, after 1.5 years of
mentorship, I would say I have failed miserably. I guess some people
are simply refusing to grow.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The moment it was voted going live was emotional, to me! I was tired
after deprivation of sleeps the weeks before, and my nerve was tense
and my expectation was high. It wasn't any surprise that the system
was approved to go-live, and I felt fairly confident at that point
because most of the major pieces have been in place, and the final
integration, though not yet bullet-proof, has been proven, and I don't
foresee much chance they won't work &amp;mdash; after all, one needs to
have faith in his own work and judgement. It's healthy to "trust but
verify", but only to a certain point. Then, you take a leap of
faith. It's like Noah going into a meet. There is not way to play the
exact game twice, thus his performance can always vary from meet to
meet. Yet, the trainings are the insurance, that he can only rely on
that as the foundation going into the race. There isn't 100%
certainty, but there must be self-confidence, trusting in the works
put in, trusting the capability built-up, trusting the will to
perform, and trusting the score he can achieve.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;First week now into the post go-live, I can feel that things are
starting to calm down, and myself is having a clearer mind from sleep
and order. I guess I'm really not made to make quick decisions, not
that I can't, but it's super stressful to me because I always felt I
don't have enough thoughts into them, and start to be frustrated and
landed on other people's toes when I seek information to feed such
decision. Fuse become short, and tension becomes high. Sometimes I
wonder whether it's my problem or others' &amp;rarr; I'd like to play the
nice guy, but in moments like those I felt being nice is like one
speaks one set of language, which, if the other party doesn't
understand, guess what, s/he receives no such message, let alone the
intention and reciprocal return of kindness. This isn't unique,
however, in this experience, but is quite universal in many aspect of
life &amp;mdash; different prospectives, different life trajectories,
different culture, different chain of reasonings.... to get someone in
sync w/ you is not only a tall order, I think it's a mission
impossible! But, as now in my position of work, it's rather a
must-have. So, what now?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Sitting here in Open Eye and writing this is such a luxury to me, that
I don't have any burning issue from work to drive (though many many on
the wish lists!), and my mind can start to think of things and topic
like this. Sometimes when looking back in life, I found it truly
&lt;strong&gt;fateful&lt;/strong&gt; &amp;mdash; fateful in the sense that in period of life,
somehow &lt;strong&gt;I was given&lt;/strong&gt; a way that I could not only balance the life
and work and all the things, but have been continuously moving
forward. How truly lucky I have been! When Noah was little, the Lenovo
job gave me so much flexibility and control of my own schedule that I
could take care of him regardless how crazy his agenda had been. Then
now, my work is literally burying me that I have even no time for
lunch almost everyday. Yet, now he is grown, having his own time and
friend and thoughts and hang-outs, and my crazy schedule can still
sort of work w/ his, sort of. But if mismatching ours by shifting the
periods in time, I could only imagine that I would have become one of
those dads in movies who missed spending time w/ kid and family due to
work, and the happy ending is of him attending to kids' school show by
ditching the work, thus showing what is more important in life &amp;mdash;
I'm in that mode now w/ this work, but I had spent good time w/ Noah,
and I can honestly pad on my own shoulder that he has always been my
priority till this job, and I haven't skipped a single time trumping
his need w/ mine. I may not be a perfect dad, well, after all, this is
my first time doing that, no practice, no rehearsal, some reference
from my dad, but, just like my work, I need to figure things out from
thin air &amp;larr; a sense of achievement, but also a lost of anxiety,
and undoubtedly, mistakes. We grew together, he and I. As I had wished
when he was born, he is becoming a good person. What a gift!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Had a chat w/ Nicole last night. Happy for her! She sent two pictures
she took, what a wonderful photos! They are as cool as any of the cool
shots I have watched on YouTube, absolute master pieces! This makes me
think that, life as a concept is equal to everyone, we all live and
die, and walk through for about that many years. Yet, what a different
&lt;strong&gt;grades&lt;/strong&gt; they are! &amp;mdash; me, walking around Chapel Hill, taking
photos of commercial posters on a electricity pole, and Nicole and
many others travel and see the stars. Do I miss much then? If I now
see the photos she took, does it make me also seeing the same view
that she had experienced? and of course, she may have had a sensation
while taking the photo, which I could never receive or duplicate. So
her grade of life is, higher? richer? better? or just, different? I
don't know. But I certainly envy the experience and the works, but it
isn't a feeling of I-wish-I-had-it-too. It's just a realization I
would say, a realization, or a recognition, a proof, that paths are
different, some sees grand view, some sees a small town poster. It
reminds me the movie, life is beautiful. Maybe there is fate to this,
also. Maybe. When looking back, perhaps, in another 10,20 years, I
would then recognize the &lt;em&gt;plot&lt;/em&gt;, and understand why it must be so,
either by my choice, or by, his? Oh well, I can only do this once, so,
the unbearable lightness of being.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Going to friend's party later today, a delayed birthday celebration,
for myself. Let's take the day off, recover, recharge, re, think,
re-experience, what is inside of me, what makes me happy, makes me
love, makes me who I am.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Enjoy the nice weather.&lt;/p&gt;</content><category term="thoughts"></category><category term="thoughts"></category></entry><entry><title>Worcester Woman</title><link href="https://fengxia41103.github.io/myblog/worcester%20woman.html" rel="alternate"></link><published>2025-05-10T08:31:00-04:00</published><updated>2025-05-10T08:31:00-04:00</updated><author><name>Feng Xia</name></author><id>tag:fengxia41103.github.io,2025-05-10:/myblog/worcester woman.html</id><summary type="html">&lt;figure class="col s12"&gt;

&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is, suffocating! What is going on? What is happening to this
country!? In this country!? By this country!? Woke up this Saturday
morning, another beautiful weather, another nice, sunny day, another
weekend of relaxing, driving Noah to swim, and myself taking care of
some chore and catching up some work day, another openeye coffee time,
mingling with a crowd, hearing the chatting noise in the background,
watching the young UNC girls coming in and out studying, another life
is beautiful, worth going through, at least for one more day.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But, watching the video clips of this Worcester woman against this crowd
of, gangsters, Gestapos, mafia, vallians, scrums of a human race,
wearing a uniform, but hiding their face, and power, and shame, and
humanity, and a thing, anything, that makes a human a human, behind a
black mask, then pushing a woman to her arrest, overpowering her,
what, 30 to 1!? 50 to 1!? one million to one!? This is not just
upsetting. Yes, it makes me very very upset. But upsetting is too …&lt;/p&gt;</summary><content type="html">&lt;figure class="col s12"&gt;

what, 30 to 1!? 50 to 1!? one million to one!? This is not just
upsetting. Yes, it makes me very very upset. But upsetting is too kind
a word describing what I am watching. This is outrage, this is, crime!
How ironic, as it has always been in human's history &amp;mdash; the
bullies always appeared in a uniform, as if that piece of cloth, is
all it takes to justify the mean &amp;larr; and I do mean, &lt;strong&gt;mean&lt;/strong&gt;, yes,
&lt;strong&gt;mean&lt;/strong&gt;, mean as in their method, mean as in what is surging through
my mind and my heart, mean as in the character of these dark shirts,
mean as in what had fallen upon us &amp;mdash; by the "people", for the
"people", and apparently, by some "people", to some "people",
selected, singled-out, treaded upon, pushed to the ground, hand
cuffed, scream silenced, plea ignored, child robbed, justice.. what
justice!?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There is no people!!!! There has never been people!!! They are not
&lt;strong&gt;my people&lt;/strong&gt;!!! Who are these monsters!? Who are they!!!? Are they
some gen-ai-ed robots!? Please tell me YES!! If only then I could
absorb this scene, and live with this so called the human race. How
can this be!!? How!!?? I read before that there had been warning siren
sounded in the air all along, since the founding of this country,
since the first ink on the Great Charter, since the idea of
Rousseau, of Martin Luther, of Kepler, of the Republic, of Socrates,
of all the sages and thinkers who had led this human race penetrating
the darkness of superstition, of religion, of what is of a good
vs. evil, of what is right vs. wrong, of what is a society and its
citizen, of what right one has vs. yield, of a contractual obligation
between the governed and the governance, of what is the distinction of
beauty vs. shame, of where we, this, &lt;em&gt;race&lt;/em&gt; (I'm feeling so shamed of
using this word now, just exactly who we are now!!?), are heading,
should head for, and "yes, we can do it".&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But. Can we still, anymore!? Brutality, ignorance, brain-washed pure
hatred, groundless assault, crowned with pleasure, pride, my duty, my
job, my patriotism... really!? After, what, two hundred forty-nine
years since July the 4th, 1776!? after the Common Sense of Thomas
Paine!? after a World War II? after exactly eighty years from Hitler?
How forgetful we all are! How shameful we all are! How ridiculous we
all are! Not long ago, Brown Shirt was a badge of "glory" turning a
person into a machine. Not long ago, White Robe was a code of
fraternity turning a cult into a mafia. Not long ago, Green military
dress and a small shining Red button turning a country of billion
people into a mad house. Not long ago, we saw these, all of these,
happened! documented! video taped! broadcasted! discussed! taugted in
class to our next generations! wished they had never happened! wished
they would never happen again!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Then, this!? I'm not surprised at all of how a human can turn against
another human w/ no sympathy, no empathy, no reservation, no mercy
&amp;mdashh; human, if can be called a living form on this planet, is the
worst of all animals, because, somehow, we have a brain that can be
persuaded to justify &lt;strong&gt;any act&lt;/strong&gt; one can dream of, any. We call
ourselves &lt;em&gt;moral&lt;/em&gt;, and determine that having it is THE difference
between us and &lt;em&gt;them&lt;/em&gt; -- cats, dogs, horses, sloths, fish,
turtle... Yet, this exact word, this exact part of a person, moral, is
the secret to success, by the tyrants, by the emperors, by the
Himmlers, by the Lenins, Starlins, Kims, Trumps, Worcester polices, and
endless such scrums yet to come.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What a thin line! What a fragile defense! What a small buffer the
history had constructed, with life and blood, with pure heart and
belief, with tears and agonies, with vows and hope, that we would
never, ever, make the same plunder again, commit the same error again,
tolerate the same act again!? Yet, flood broke all dams, all banks,
all sandbags, all wishes. Just like how it plays out in nature &amp;mdash;
water and fire, when standing in front of them, a building, a trench,
a barrier, an individual, is, utterly, nothing. I have always awed by
the power of the earthquake, the tsunami, even the seeming gentle wave
caressing an ocean beach. Now I'm awed by the power of hate, of
division of "we" against "them", of the power of the medieval
intolerance and purge, of the power of Nationalism and its spawns, of
the power of stupidity of us all, of how close we are no better than a
cave man &amp;mdash; we call them the Croods. We, are the Crood.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I just realized, 2025, is marking the 30-year from my coming to this
country. I remember the first week in Chicago, still jetlagged, and
curious of this brave new world. Riding the harbor cruise in Chicago
downtown, I couldn't yet appreciate the night scene of Chicago
downtown and all what this land has to offer. I knew there is a good
life, called hope, ahead of me, but had no idea what it could
be. Then, Lei, looking over the side of the boat, said, "If I ever
came to here even as a tourist, I would then jump off the boat and
start swimming to shore. Isn't this beautiful!?" I couldn't understand
much then. I felt surprised why he would take such an &lt;em&gt;extreme&lt;/em&gt;
measure for this &amp;mdash; yes it's nice looking, but really? jumping
off a boat for this? Then, with years living here, having family, kid,
life, I had convinced myself that, scenery aside, big buildings in
downtown aside, affluent society aside, there is an idea, a moral
line, a everyone is equal in front of law, a we have a system in place
to prevent, ban, eliminate, a king ruling w/ his free will and
like. We, citizens, rule, and that's the idea, the spirit, the core
ideal, the backbone of all these 80s-looking un-modern town, road,
bridge, hotel, life, about, and that's the environment, the best a
parent can give, to his child. I can't I have been a model citizen in
any practical sense to be proud of. But I can honestly look at myself
in the face when I die that I did my part, carried my share, lived by
my heart, and tried the best I knew how. But now, I feel the glass
castle, I should say, a sand castle, is disappearing right in front of
my own eyes! What is going on!? What place will Noah have? This? This
is the best I can give!? This is the best of a promise, coded in the
constitution, guarded by the check and balance, pledged when we put
our hands over our heart?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The most recent line I picked up echos loud, 人间不值得. Indeed. With
a 人间 with such an ignorance and unenlightened, we are fooling
ourselves that human has progressed. We took a small step so far, and
still standing at brink of an abyss, ready to fall, fast.&lt;/p&gt;</content><category term="thoughts"></category><category term="thoughts"></category></entry><entry><title>Abstract</title><link href="https://fengxia41103.github.io/myblog/2025.html" rel="alternate"></link><published>2025-01-20T08:44:00-05:00</published><updated>2025-01-20T08:44:00-05:00</updated><author><name>Feng Xia</name></author><id>tag:fengxia41103.github.io,2025-01-20:/myblog/2025.html</id><summary type="html">&lt;figure class="col s12"&gt;

&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Driving to see Noah's weekend swim meet past Saturday morning. I guess
it was the theme of the day, that many drivers rushed overtaking me,
and either found themselves waiting for at the traffic light ahead
&amp;mdash; it's either a poor timing that right after they passed me, the
light tuned red, or I was slowing down cause the light is red ahead,
but they still felt the urge to overtake, probably more of a statement
or a vent of frustration. In any case, I found it rather humorous
seeing them like a sitting duck when my car slowly approach while they
got nowhere to go.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This isn't new. But this time I got me thinking, that this,
phenomenon, can be categorized into one of the three buckets &amp;mdash;
眼睛不好, 脑子不好, or 运气不好. Hahaha. But then, while I was feeling
proud of such philosophical summary, I wondered how true they are? I
mean, are these three cover all the scenarios? Thinking of the &lt;a href="https://medium.com/lessons-from-mckinsey/the-pyramid-principle-f0885dd3c5c7"&gt;the
pyramid principle&lt;/a&gt;, how would …&lt;/p&gt;</summary><content type="html">&lt;figure class="col s12"&gt;

pyramid principle&lt;/a&gt;, how would I know that these three categories
are sufficient? For the 眼睛不好, apparently this can be proven false
(证伪), but this can't be said for the other two. Arguably you could
say sort-of for the 脑子不好, which I am thinking of psychoanalysis
type of diagnosis. But still, the word 脑子 is ambiguous. As for the
&lt;em&gt;luck&lt;/em&gt;, there isn't a way of proving at all except more of a fun urban
legend, or a popular form of excuse, for better and for worse, indeed!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Therefore, out of this smart line, 2 of the 3 are not verifiable,
which then makes the credibility of this line dramatically less than
what I had initially felt &amp;mdash; quite a bogus,
looks-cool-but-no-substance type of remarks (and the world is not
short of these, in words and in prints). Why!? Why the line sounds
both &lt;em&gt;smart&lt;/em&gt; to my ears, but at the meantime is a BS? I wonder. The
smartness can certainly impress, if not fool, somebody, right? If I
hadn't taken the time to ask whether they are comprehensive, I could
no have come to the realization that two of them are just vain
saying. However, as I have mentioned, there are plenty of such lines
around, and how many did we really a &lt;strong&gt;good thought&lt;/strong&gt; whether they can
survive a scrutiny? And not, then hadn't I accepted some of them &lt;em&gt;at
its face value&lt;/em&gt; and used them as if they are golden lines?
Interesting.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So, why I think the latter two can not be verified, 脑子不好, 运气不好?
Because the nouns &lt;strong&gt;lack a definition&lt;/strong&gt;, you just can't define the
word 脑子, 运气, I guess I should say, you can't measure such a thing,
thus making them &lt;strong&gt;objectively un-provable&lt;/strong&gt;. They are,
abstraction. "Abstraction", google said, is "something which exists
only as an idea". In order to make a golden line ring, it must be an
abstraction, a line of an idea summarized out of a general pattern of
events. Can one prove an abstraction, or an idea? I suppose you can!
A theory is an idea, right? then it's provable. But then why some
ideas can be proven (eg. physics), and some can't (eg. religious)? I
don't know. When I started writing this, I thought my conclusion was
that an abstraction is inherently unprovable, but now I'm not so sure.
However, in any case, an abstraction, is inherently a &lt;strong&gt;subjective
opinion&lt;/strong&gt; &amp;mdash; why I pick this characteristic of these events but
not that!? As cliche as it can be, 1000 ppl has 1000 version of
Hamlet, thus out of the same group of events, I'm certain there can be
1000 versions of such &lt;em&gt;golden lines&lt;/em&gt;, and mine is not smarter than
yours at all, just that many people either don't come up their own
Hamlet (thus taking others as the Master's saying), or not making
theirs heard (often until such a conversation is engaged, in which all
of a sudden one finds everyone has a version! The difference is often
being that some have been brewing for a while, while others were only
improvised and quickly forgotten as soon as the dinner talk ends).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So back to the golden line. All these golden lines must be abstraction
because that's what makes it relevant to most audience &amp;larr;
individual lives their own events, which are discrete by nature, your
event is independent of mine, but these golden lines take the pattern
out of our two events, and make them echo w/ both of us, thus we nod
and say 好有道理! While saying so, we often felt we have found the
core of these events &amp;mdash; ah, so this is how they work!. But now
with this article, if you have followed so far, you should now realize
that these lines are, someone's summary/opinion, take or leave, they
are no different than your mom says 该穿秋裤了! Like anything
regarding opinion, remind yourself of independent thinking, meaning,
take the one given by others w/ a grain of salt, chew on it, it's more
fun to find loophole in these lines, aka. being critical, than taking
it wholesale. I guess these lines are just like code, or fiction, or a
shoe &amp;mdash; quality varies substantially, some like 华为, communism,
and some like &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Locke"&gt;John Locke&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Martin_Luther"&gt;Martin Luther&lt;/a&gt; and his reformation,
and any honest person you know in life.&lt;/p&gt;</content><category term="thoughts"></category><category term="thoughts"></category></entry><entry><title>Christmas eve homeless woman</title><link href="https://fengxia41103.github.io/myblog/christmas%20eve%20homeless%20woman.html" rel="alternate"></link><published>2024-12-24T14:02:00-05:00</published><updated>2024-12-24T14:02:00-05:00</updated><author><name>Feng Xia</name></author><id>tag:fengxia41103.github.io,2024-12-24:/myblog/christmas eve homeless woman.html</id><summary type="html">&lt;figure class="col s12"&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Walking back from the local camera store, beautiful weather. Under the
sun it's feeling quite warm actually, like an early Spring. Here sit a
homeless woman. I couldn't tell from afar w/o my glasses. She was
sitting in the shadow on a bench outside a local auto shop. I didn't
notice till she moved. Then, she and I acrossed the intersection
together. I recognize her &amp;mdash; I actually I think I saw her quite a
few times on Franklin street, w/ other homeless people. I think
yesterday morning outside the Open Eye I ran into her also, in the
bitter morning cold, that she made a gesture as if asking for a smoke,
and I said sorry I don't smoke and don't have one. Today the same
gesture happened, and I answered the same way. Then while walking

&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Walking back from the local camera store, beautiful weather. Under the
sun it's feeling quite warm actually, like an early Spring. Here sit a
homeless woman. I couldn't tell from afar w/o my glasses. She was
sitting in the shadow on a bench outside a local auto shop. I didn't
notice till she moved. Then, she and I acrossed the intersection
together. I recognize her &amp;mdash; I actually I think I saw her quite a
few times on Franklin street, w/ other homeless people. I think
yesterday morning outside the Open Eye I ran into her also, in the
bitter morning cold, that she made a gesture as if asking for a smoke,
and I said sorry I don't smoke and don't have one. Today the same
gesture happened, and I answered the same way. Then while walking
along I could feel she was behind me. So I turned around, and repeated
that sorry I don't have anything to offer. Then, she gestured me to
take a picture of her! A bit surprised, but I didn't feel so, so I
declined it. While in it I started to notice that she seemed could not
make a sound(!). Then, she grabbed the frog on my bag, and made like a
deep gollum sound, which I couldn't tell whether she was trying to
talk or just a sound. Seeing she is interested in the frog, and also I
was a bit scared, I told her this is my son's, and she made a smile. I
went on, saying have a nice day, and walked on. She trailed a bit
further, then, in front of I was going to pass a community housing
establishment, outside which sat three or four men, also homeless
looking. She didn't follow any further, as if they have an agreement
of territory/turf.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This whole, incident, made me sad.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I don't know her. Like said I have seen her before, but it never made
me to think twice. I'm wondering, how much does it really take for a
person, a human being like her, to fall to the bottom of a society? I
had a bit fear of her, admittedly, but then, I wouldn't fear as such
at all if she were a street cat or dog, I wonder. Why? Why I would not
like being around a human, while I would have felt a much stronger
sympathy towards a cat or dog? Isn't it because underline I had
assumed that she had had a chance not to be like this? But how could I
know if she was ever given such a chance? What says she was to setup
to be like this since young? Why would I think dog, or cat, would then
deserve a sympathy? Isn't because I assumed that it's caused by a
irresponsible owner? that all dogs and cats are essentially, alike?
Why? If by counting the shere variety of human being and their
personalities, I think it's only logical that there are many different
kinds among dogs and cats, that some are, like good human being, kind,
sweet, and so on, while there are others that are, at where they are
because their own doing. We assumed all animals are alike because we
think they operate by so called animal instinct, which, in my mind and
perhaps in many others' as well, is pretty much the same across any
animal species as long as they are not human &amp;larr; now to think of
this, this must be a huge exaggeration, or generalization, which
unlikely to be true! Dogs and cats much have variations of
cat/dog-personalities just like human! Some do well, some don't.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Then, does it really take much for a person to fall? or a cat/dog?
There are quite a few seemingly homeless people roaming around town. I
feel bad for them, especially when I saw them sitting outside in a
bitter cold. Why don't they find a shelter? Is there a shelter? How do
they survive, if today, tonight, then how about tomorrow? next week?
How long could one last like this? I don't know, and I wonder whether
myself is really that far from falling under just like that? I suppose
they had family, parents, a house, a home, all those things. Yet,
somehow, something happened to them that they are now living in a
layer of this town that is so different from mine. I don't know why,
but I really don't think it takes much to be like that. We say life is
fragile, then I wonder life in the sense of a day-2-day living is also
fragile, that one of something could take you down, like a rock all of
sudden caught on your feet when you are peddling water in a torrent
&amp;mdash; maybe it's just like that. I don't know whether it's of their
own fault that they now live like this. But I kinda doubt it. It's
easy to say that they choose this way when they don't go to shelter
and that. I think that's only a saying after they have fallen &amp;mdash;
more of a way to reconcile oneself w/ a harsh reality. Who doesn't
want to live in comfort, w/ abundance, hot coffee, good meal, and all
that?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I can't forget that the woman grabbed the frog, almost like a small
kid who couldn't resist the temptation when seeing sth she likes. I
still don't know what she was trying to say. I feel bad for her, and
for me didn't have a courage to make more conversation, or to find out
what she wanted. I can't give her this frog, but next time I could
offer to buy her a coffee, if that suits her need.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So this is what happened on this xmas eve day, 2024. Maybe I need to
learn to be more sympathetic towards another human?&lt;/p&gt;</content><category term="thoughts"></category><category term="thoughts"></category></entry><entry><title>Chinese Proverb</title><link href="https://fengxia41103.github.io/myblog/chinese%20proverb.html" rel="alternate"></link><published>2024-12-15T09:37:00-05:00</published><updated>2024-12-15T09:37:00-05:00</updated><author><name>Feng Xia</name></author><id>tag:fengxia41103.github.io,2024-12-15:/myblog/chinese proverb.html</id><summary type="html">&lt;figure class="col s12"&gt;

&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;All of sudden last night I started to realize what is wrong w/ the
Chinese logics, and why Chinese language env today is so polluted with
such even though they all appear to be so, correct &amp;mdash; because the
usage of proverb which has been inherited from so-acclaimed hundreds
or even thousands of years of historical development, is fundamentally
&lt;strong&gt;flawed&lt;/strong&gt; in the sense of communication, and &lt;strong&gt;in particular&lt;/strong&gt;,
debate.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Because it does not define a &lt;strong&gt;context&lt;/strong&gt;!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yes, it does not. Take any proverb you are familiar with, or that you
have used as a roll-off-your-tongue in your recent conversation so to
back up an opinion (yes, it is always used in a context of an opinion,
&lt;strong&gt;always&lt;/strong&gt;), because their trademark is short (usually a 4-word
phrase) and supposed concise, it has been honored as a wonderful term
of capturing a large amount of info into a small body of text, and
means to be shooting the arrow right on the bullseye, always.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;However, that's the exact the problem. With a short body of text, it
provides …&lt;/p&gt;</summary><content type="html">&lt;figure class="col s12"&gt;

of capturing a large amount of info into a small body of text, and
means to be shooting the arrow right on the bullseye, always.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;However, that's the exact the problem. With a short body of text, it
provides no ramp for building the context of this phrase except of its
historical background/story, which is meant to be drawn as a parallel
by the listener or the speaker, to what is being talked about right
now. But, by doing so, it defines, yes, I want to emphasize the word
&lt;strong&gt;define&lt;/strong&gt;, absolutely nothing of its appearance in the sentence. So
called 只可意会不可言传, which relieves the burden of the speaker
him/her-self of providing the definition, thus the clarity of its
logical reasoning between point A &amp;rarr; point B, while at the same
time as an evidence to support a statement &amp;lrarr; this is the exact
logical fallacy of the &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Burden_of_proof_(philosophy)"&gt;burden of proof&lt;/a&gt;!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Therefore, when everybody, and I do mean everybody, regardless of the
level of education, have been acquaint with these phrases since
childhood, have been using them all over the place in their daily
interaction w/ this world, and the phrases themselves have been viewed
as one of the crown jewels of tradition (&amp;larr; I do want to write
about this word, "tradition", someday, because I feel this is such an
abused word that it becomes a garbage bag of a catch-all, which again
is proliferated in today's China in many aspect of its society, for
example, legal, and it's really really really sad, and bizzare), such
fallacy is then became a label of honor, a way of showing off, like
someone's Gucci bag, a vanity tag! &amp;mdash; so called &lt;em&gt;educated&lt;/em&gt;,
&lt;em&gt;sophisticated&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;em&gt;elite&lt;/em&gt; member of this society, if you could easily
toss around a few of these proverbs mingled into your lines, as if it
itself is a no-need-to-prove truth, so that it makes whatever the
point you are making, also valid.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But, I'm sorry, ladies and gentelmen, fallacy is
fallacy. Period. Having a billion people doing it doesn't make a
fallacy a correct logic. It only shows the deficiency of awareness of
such fallacy, and the lacking of self-awareness that you look back at
what you just said, trying to pull yourself out of the subjective view
point, as a bystander, to listen, view, think over the same line you
just said, see if there are holes in it &amp;mdash; and 99 out of 100 of
times you will find it not so robust, unfortunately (this is another
topic I'd like to research more, which, as of this moment, I think
it's due to the flaw of human language, that it itself lacks
capability to define clarity).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Therefore, the challenge in communication today, regardless the form,
is that many times the definition/clarity of the word is &lt;strong&gt;not
precise&lt;/strong&gt;, perhaps except math symbols. We need more, context, that
before an opinion is expressed, a statement is made, we need more
words in front it, adj &amp;amp; adv, to define the scope/context/background,
and in statement to make the reasoning, logical link between your
evidence to your statement as clear, precise, engineering like
(meaning, be factual &amp;mdash; measurable, thus defeatible), as
possible, not its opposite!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;These proverbs are, literacy &amp;mdash; they convey an emotion, a thing
that passed down over time to our inheritance. But they are actually,
IMHO, in the same category as the Bible, or any religious scripts
&amp;mdash; they are interpretated by priest, good for some Sunday
pleasures, spiritual peace and meaning-of-your-life psychology
goad. So next time you use proverb, or hear one, pray is a better
fitting reaction to it than applause &amp;mdash; yes, awe its beauty, its
power, its history. But you walk out a church, you still need go to
your job, earn the living, eat McDonald's, beat the
traffic... proverbs don't put dinner on the table, and now I hope you
could see its limit, and where they actually belong &amp;mdash; church,
cult, your prayer, and that's about it.&lt;/p&gt;</content><category term="thoughts"></category><category term="thoughts"></category></entry><entry><title>No logic</title><link href="https://fengxia41103.github.io/myblog/no%20logic.html" rel="alternate"></link><published>2024-09-21T09:32:00-04:00</published><updated>2024-09-21T09:32:00-04:00</updated><author><name>Feng Xia</name></author><id>tag:fengxia41103.github.io,2024-09-21:/myblog/no logic.html</id><summary type="html">&lt;figure class="col s6"&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Long time no see.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The escalating violence happening in the piece of land is prompting me
to write something. Also, a very tiring week, somehow, even though
work went well, made a presentation of Gen AI to the CIO crowd and all
the &lt;em&gt;captains&lt;/em&gt; on the ship, and I suppose it was received well, thus
it's really a good start of my day in this org. But towards the end of
Friday, I felt my entire system was slowing down, and I was even too
tired to play the phone. Maybe it's just a relaxing time after a
highly focused session, like a running train on sprint, that needs a
break to rest.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So this morning, all I want to do is to sit in OpenEye and dump brain,
on the events that is happening, that, from any way I could think of,
is a rare black-and-white one, thus should have had a pretty
straightforward expectation of people's reaction. Yet, reading replies

view of human being, or to be more specific, of the subset of human
being living on that land, governed by that team, could be so off!?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It is no secret that the so called &lt;strong&gt;-ism&lt;/strong&gt; is living on fostering
nothing but hatred, that it feeds off a sentiment of humiliation
&amp;rarr; agony &amp;rarr; revenge. The script they have in mind is
essentially of a slave turning to a master. Not that this is
incorrect, as many Hollywood movies of motivating kind speak of the
same line. But somehow, these &lt;strong&gt;-ism&lt;/strong&gt; ones are, different! What is
it? It's like a code smell, it's more of a feel, by experience, that
it is not a good idea, and in this case, it's rather a bad one. I like
a recent word, 解构, that to analyze and destruct a complex (and many
times the complexity is just seemingly so) concept into a digestable
structure/framework/components so that one gets to comprehend, in my
engineering term, what is under the hood (while typing the word
"hood", just reminded me the &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Little_Red_Riding_Hood"&gt;little red riding
hood&lt;/a&gt;, in which
what is under the hood!? a wolf!!!). And not surprisingly, well, I
should actually say, surprisingly, when you start 解构, very likely
you ended up finding a wolf under the hood, and it's exactly the case
in today's China, a wolf.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Its wolf warrior diplomats have been roaming around the world stage,
howling and hissing for a while now. Funded by the fostered hatred
over the ages of prosperity, which, by a common sense, should have
been cultivated the population towards an urge to improve, to be
learned, to be empathetic, to be intelligent of telling good vs. bad,
right vs. wrong, to be yearning for more of the goods which they have
just felt the benefits, to be wanting in company of those who have the
attributes, to be disgusted by those who weighs behinds... yet,
surprise! Here is this 14B people, enjoying all the benefits of the
human civilization and inguity, turned against the root of all these
exact same benefits &amp;mdash; that of collaboration, learning from each
other, being grateful for the giants when we stand on their shoulders,
and being humble w/ our own limitation, ignorance, likelyhood of being
in fault, and tolerance of difference. This is a pure &lt;strong&gt;ironic&lt;/strong&gt;!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And this is getting me very much curious. How could one, already
been through the disaster of the exact behavior or idea that it will
bring, thus knowing all too well what is at the other end of the
tunnel, yet choose just again of the same wine given that it is a new
bottle this time. Isn't this, stupid, or what!? I can't even be sure
that the word &lt;em&gt;stupidity&lt;/em&gt; is a proper word to describe this. This is
nearly a pure insantity!  This is literally the definition of one
whose mind has gong insane, that the common sense and common logic
don't apply anymore, that one is seeking out for harm as if they were
pleasure. Back in time religious believers did the same thing to themselves, backed
by their, belief. Now fast forward 1000 years, I'm witnessing the same
effect, but not sure what belief that is!? Or, if it were a belief,
then I really don't think it's a good one. I hold that myself has no
position to judge anyone's belief, whatever it may be, but at the mean
time, myself is entitled to hold my own belief/judgement, also, and I
think what they are &lt;em&gt;believing&lt;/em&gt; is a complete nonsense!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Killing a 10-year old boy, a random kid on the street, is a
crime. Period. There isn't much in life that is black &amp;amp; white, and
this one, is. Period. Forget about wiggling out of this one. Even if
the person is medically insane, what was done was,
&lt;strong&gt;wrong&lt;/strong&gt;. Reasoning this that root of the crime is a historical
grudge (and btw, not even a personal one, but a broad stoke of a
nation-2-nation, race-2-race) is a complete nonsense because, the act
of reasoning must build a logic chain of &lt;strong&gt;causal&lt;/strong&gt;
relationships, and being &lt;strong&gt;causal&lt;/strong&gt; is not an easy task! Of course you
&lt;em&gt;can claim anything "causal"&lt;/em&gt; in your coffee chat, that of a butterfly
effect, that of 子非鱼 焉知鱼之乐 kind of defense. But, that's just
the fun of it. If you do indeed take such defense seriously, you are
already done &amp;mdash; because such line is nothing but a 话术, or my
word, arguing for arguing's sake &amp;larr; &lt;strong&gt;This is not reasoning. This
is a statement &amp;mdash; that you just want to win.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Therefore, what they are doing is dressing up the true intention of
winning under a hood of reasoning &amp;rarr; they want to appear they are,
"reasonable", but they themselve have no idea of reasoning, no
intention to reason, and no sense of such contradict. Like a cave man,
or the babies, insensitive to pain, not because they are strong, but
because they are too dumb to understand. And this, is what is
happening. Incredible, isn't it? That with all the modern technology
in everyone's life, all the knowledge and info you could easy get w/
your phone, which, again ironically, everyone there is holding on and
cheering about as their life line, someone could be in such a mental
state. I don't get it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There have been fables, stories, proverbs, all of these, that roll off
everyone's tongue as if they are the wisdom, the smart lines. And yet,
if only one is willing to pause, and look at what oneself has just
said, just done, just applauded for, one will be shocked, that what
you just jeered at 2 seconds ago, are being done by yourself right
now! The response of 为什么说对不起 when you were not the killer, is a
great example of this &amp;mdash; the same rational goes years back that不
是你撞的为什么要扶, which essentially derives to 事不关己高高挂起.
Well, great! If the replier, you, does indeed stand by this, then pls
put your finger prints here, because then I will continue the logical
reasoning to show where this line will lead you to. &lt;strong&gt;Do you dare!?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Let's start where, actually anywhere will do. Once this is your life
belief, the none-of-my-biz logic above, any harm bestowed on you will
lose any ground for you to complain, because the bestowers are
strangers to you, and by following your line, they feel no shame, no
guilt, no remorse, and &lt;strong&gt;no need&lt;/strong&gt;. You got cut off in traffic? too
bad. You want to return sth w/ a receipt? no way.... cause as soon as
everyone is for him/her-self mode is turned on, this so called
&lt;em&gt;society&lt;/em&gt; is done! There is not group, no association, no community,
no bond, no trust, no reliance, anymore. This is not the
personal-freedom mode you may mistakenly think of &amp;larr; this is the
jungle mode 1.0, even before wolfs hunt packs &amp;rarr; this is the time
when wolf will eat wolf. &lt;strong&gt;Do you still dare!?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I can be sure they don't have the brain capacity to derive this
far. Thus everything I just painted is nothing but a &lt;em&gt;huh&lt;/em&gt; to
them. However, that's the one and only thing that human shines above
all other living being on this planet so far, that of the power of
reasoning so that you could &lt;em&gt;guess&lt;/em&gt; what it can be, that there is a
wall on this path, without having to run into the wall first! Now they
are just giving this all up, the only worthy trait a human has as a life
form has!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I guess this is the case in point of 被仇恨蒙蔽双眼. I don't know who
is the God of Hatred. Whoever that is will be pretty happy right now,
cause, by the latest count of 8.2B people on earth, 17.07% of them are
your followers. I don't know where there is also grade of smart
vs. dumb in the world of hatred, I would guess there must be, it's the
universal law, that within any group/team, 20% are the ones who carry
80% of the load, the remains are just 猪队友, dead weight, that drags
the team down. Well, there you go, mr. God, not sure the quality of
your teammates here, and for the 20% elites, &lt;strong&gt;good luck&lt;/strong&gt;, cause a
combination of &lt;strong&gt;hate+stupidity&lt;/strong&gt; is a pretty sure recipe for
something unpleasant, and being close to them is, in my common sense,
or should I say in my sincere suggestion, not a good idea.&lt;/p&gt;</content><category term="thoughts"></category><category term="thoughts"></category></entry><entry><title>51</title><link href="https://fengxia41103.github.io/myblog/51.html" rel="alternate"></link><published>2024-05-19T00:47:00-04:00</published><updated>2024-05-19T00:47:00-04:00</updated><author><name>Feng Xia</name></author><id>tag:fengxia41103.github.io,2024-05-19:/myblog/51.html</id><summary type="html">&lt;figure class="col s12"&gt;

&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Came back from party. Met w/ good friends for some food and
card. Towards the end I just snapped. I don't know why I got so tipped
off by the saying. Maybe it's the "I don't care", which sounds to me
always like a BS, because this exact same words can be applied
mutually, if it has any validity. Isn't that we could all say the same
thing to each other, if we don't wish things to work out? Therefore, I
don't see any value in this line except as nothing but a moral high
ground in an argument in order to win.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I don't know. Noah's mom said the same thing before, while she was
frustrated and was trying to find a way of comfort. She said the only way
she found not get hurt by me was to tell herself not to care. I
couldn't understand this at all at that time. Now over these years I

don't care, then that doesn't hurt as much any more.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But again. What is this? This line always feels like a selfish choice,
or a self-defence choice, when I have nothing to offer anymore, when I
don't want to think for others anymore but for myself. Then I retreat
into my own shell, shut the door, and tell myself they are not worth
my caring anymore. This seems to be more of a strategy for the weak,
but not of a wise, and certainly not of a strong. Maybe secretly I
wish myself to be strong, to be brave, to have a gut to stand up, thus
don't like the line and its tone. Maybe I'm frustrated not of the
friend who said this, nor of the line itself even, but of myself, of
an image of self which I am not achieving, and perhaps never will
achieve. I recall first time hearing this from the college buddy who
is a Shanghai native, that 关你屁事 关我屁事. I found it puzzling,
rude, and laughable. Yet, years later now, I would almost say that my
advice to anyone would, and should, only be this phrase &amp;mdash; 关你屁
事 关我屁事 &amp;mdash; this sums it all, of the entirety of life and this
world, of its complication, of its puzzling way of running, of how one
could ever navigate through its course without feeling destroyed by
emotion, without being lost, and without being bullied by its
unfairness and its seemingly always backwards reward issues in which
the kind, the lovely, the beauty, the innocent are taken advantage of
by the dishonest, the selfish, the manipulative, the rude, the unkind,
the cold heart, the seekers of benefit, and the thief of the heart.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But. If this is the only defence I could have, I still feel painful to
exercise this however effective and protective it might be. When I
can't feel the pain, what of me left anymore? If there is no judge and
feeling of right and wrong, what's of a reference to act, everyday? If
there isn't an emotion of joy, love, pity, disgust, disappointment,
betrayal, desire, wish to have but had not, wish to gain but had not,
wish to help but had not, then, what's of me, anymore? I don't
know. Sometimes I think these are the same as bravery, that you choose
to suffer so that u know the nerve is working, to be unhappy so that u
know u can feel happy, to be torn by emotion so that u know u can
still love, care... but sometimes I also think they are pretty
pointless in practice sense, that suffer isn't to make you stronger
but weaker, unhappiness isn't to make you more sensitive but more
dull, emotion isn't to make you interesting but unwise, like
tonight's.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I don't know. I feel very sorry the other friends had to go through
this which I created. Even when the motivation was to make everyone
happy, I ended up taking an act that makes everyone the
opposite. Ironical, isn't it!? I don't know. Should I have commented
it, or not? Should I have voiced the opinion, or not? Should I be true
to our feeling if the snap is itself a possibility and now a reality,
or not?.... I don't know what the answer should be. There isn't any, I
would guess. I'm just mumbling here with a cloudy mind, and a cloudy
day, a cloudy evening when thunder could be heard close, and a cloudy
mind that reasons without reasoning, a chaos.&lt;/p&gt;</content><category term="thoughts"></category><category term="thoughts"></category></entry><entry><title>Protest Isreal</title><link href="https://fengxia41103.github.io/myblog/protest%20isreal.html" rel="alternate"></link><published>2024-04-27T21:26:00-04:00</published><updated>2024-04-27T21:26:00-04:00</updated><author><name>Feng Xia</name></author><id>tag:fengxia41103.github.io,2024-04-27:/myblog/protest isreal.html</id><summary type="html">&lt;figure class="col s12"&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Beautiful weather. Went to the balcony after gym, and saw a gathering
of some sort at the church across street. Perfect to try some
photography! Was thinking to take Zf for a walk, but still felt
to take the Df instead.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A small section of the street was blocked by four policy cars, two on
each side. People were having their fun, food was served, DJ was
playing loud music. By the time I was walking across they were
inviting people to dance. Then by the time I walked around town and
came back passing this same spot, crowd had all gone home, stage was
cleared, and only some were putting stuff away, and a stack of folding
chairs standing there ready to be picked up.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I wouldn't have given it much thought if not because that earlier on
this walk I ran into a camp by chance, a camp of protesters on a lawn
on campus. Signs were put up says &lt;strong&gt;Gaza&lt;/strong&gt;. Tents flattened like a

&lt;p&gt;I wouldn't have given it much thought if not because that earlier on
this walk I ran into a camp by chance, a camp of protesters on a lawn
on campus. Signs were put up says &lt;strong&gt;Gaza&lt;/strong&gt;. Tents flattened like a
piece of floor mat lying on the ground everywhere. A couple young kids
were drawing using chalks on the brick walk which cut across the camp,
dividing it to two sides. Along this walk was a row of tables with
people standing behind. Turned out they were serving out food, drinks,
and I guess other necessities. More supplies seemed brought in, and a
group of them were sitting on the ground drawing or writing something
on a carboard size sign materials &amp;mdash; the word "genocide" was,
everywhere, "divest", "no university", "stop", "13,800 ppl have been
killed", one kid dies every 10 min (or second?)....&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I don't know. I was surprised that they were there, many looked, and
by the words on the sign referring to the "school", "UNC",
"university", I took many of them are UNC students. But why?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I don't understand. I heard on youtube yesterday that American
colleges are seeing escalation of this protest against Isreal w/ the
quote-&amp;amp;-quote "genocide". But I don't get this. Didn't they see the
beginning of all this, that Hamas raided that music festival, killing,
raping, shot on video, showed off to the world, as if they were on a
celebration!? So, what do they expect? Just walks away from all these,
crimes, crimes against humanity, crimes against the very word
&lt;strong&gt;peace&lt;/strong&gt; that these protesters are using, crimes against their own
family, friends, neighbours, classmates, strangers who share the same
living space so called Gaza. How could these students fold their eyes
on this? Is Isreal really &lt;em&gt;over-reacting&lt;/em&gt; when Hamas built their
bunkers, tunnels, camouflaged using a hospital, a school? Can the
people who works there claim &lt;em&gt;innocent&lt;/em&gt; that they didn't know? If they
did know, what else do they think will happen? They are innocent in
the sense of action, but not in the sense of knowing, and in the end,
tolerating.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Gaza and its residents tolerated the existence of this extreme group,
and some of them even supported it, participated it, and carried out
its command. They are the minority, alright. But the crime of silence
is real, it kills, and it killed. This is exact the thing that these
protesters are voicing &amp;mdash; that they are &lt;strong&gt;not tolerating&lt;/strong&gt; the
violence Isreal is showing. And this, should be the role model for
Gaza! Raise your voice, act, if you indeed don't like Hamas, then, say
it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And if you don't, then, well.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The students got this all reversed. It's not about the Isreal being
right or wrong. Rather, their exact protest is the lesson they should
be giving to Gaza &amp;mdash; the way of support Gaza, if they sincerely
believe this, is to ask Gaza people to say what they truly feel
&amp;mdash; if they look at Hamas the same way I do, then, silence is not
the right thing to do. Find a piece of lawn. Put up a sign, just like
these students are doing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But. If these people indeed think the Hamas is a good egg. Well, then
I think this camp on campus, with all its goodwill, is a hypocrisy on
display.&lt;/p&gt;</content><category term="thoughts"></category><category term="thoughts"></category></entry><entry><title>How many farewell</title><link href="https://fengxia41103.github.io/myblog/how%20many%20farewell.html" rel="alternate"></link><published>2024-03-18T19:36:00-04:00</published><updated>2024-03-18T19:36:00-04:00</updated><author><name>Feng Xia</name></author><id>tag:fengxia41103.github.io,2024-03-18:/myblog/how many farewell.html</id><summary type="html">&lt;figure class="col s12"&gt;

&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;How many farewell one say in a life? With growing age, I found
farewell harder and harder to bear. I remember the time when I saw mom
crying over a TV scene, and couldn't understand why she was so. I
always thought it's just because, women are all like that &amp;mdash;
sensitive, sentimental, cry over any little things that provokes their
feelings.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But. Now at the age, watching yet another TV scene of a Japanese
drama, the kid leaving home to Tokyo w/ big dreams and big future, it
suddenly hit me that, didn't the same happen to me when I was at the
airport waiting for my very first flight in life on my way to Ohio? I
felt excited, nervous, happy, and very little sadness. Yet, mom,
dad... now I start to understand how they had felt then. If fast
forwarding for two years, when Noah is to leave for college, I can see
that now, I can see myself standing there, watching him leave, flying
out of the nest, w/ his big dream …&lt;/p&gt;</summary><content type="html">&lt;figure class="col s12"&gt;

that now, I can see myself standing there, watching him leave, flying
out of the nest, w/ his big dream, his future, his life, but I would
feel so sad.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I truely wonder, how many farewell one could say in life? how many one
could bear in life? Didn't I say it to her then, wishing a life to
unfold in front of her, just life I will be saying to Noah soon, so to
remove myself from their path to adventure, to enjoy, and perhaps, to
suffer?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When young, I never thought twice saying farewell &amp;mdash; it felt,
light, insignificant, inconsequential, almost bogus, cause we usually
had plenty chances after to meet, to see each other. So a farewell
felt rather like a formality that a young kid is trying to mimic an
adult, yet knowing nothing of its weight. But now, each farewell
feels, heart wrenching, for I learned, a farewell carries so much
hope, so much bless, so much wishful joy, for the one departing, and
so much sadness to cary, for the one staying.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Farewell. Farewell. Maybe there is a fix count of farewells one can
say, each, once said, depletes a part of oneself, till no more. But
sometimes, I felt, one can be allocated too many, that s/he has to
carry that, with each farewell, like a cut, bleeds. It's a bless you
have so many friends, family, ppl you care, who accompany you for long
and for short in life. What you pay as the price, is the pain, the
tear, the sense of loss, the sadness, a deep sigh.&lt;/p&gt;</content><category term="thoughts"></category><category term="thoughts"></category></entry><entry><title>Cold Winter Night</title><link href="https://fengxia41103.github.io/myblog/cold%20winter%20night.html" rel="alternate"></link><published>2024-01-21T22:44:00-05:00</published><updated>2024-01-21T22:44:00-05:00</updated><author><name>Feng Xia</name></author><id>tag:fengxia41103.github.io,2024-01-21:/myblog/cold winter night.html</id><summary type="html">&lt;figure class="col s12"&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Sitting in the dark and listening to these music, watching the night
outside the window, flashing nights on the building far away, a few
cars running on the road at this hour, a cold cold winter night. I
miss dad &amp;amp; Lei, miss 猪娃娃, miss the days in Shenzhen, miss the time of
laughing, of talking, of coffeeing early in the morning, of playing
arcades, of window shopping, of watching the water fountain dancing w/
the music, of the crowd around, of the chess game at Nanshan, sitting
on bench watching the city below, of thinking of days passed, of the
people missed, of the life ahead, of the time behind. What a journey a
life is! I don't know how to tread this path well, or better, or
worse, each step seems permanent, uncertain at best, hardly there were
a few moments in life when I knew exactly what to do next &amp;mdash; like
going home to put dad to rest. And even then …&lt;/p&gt;</summary><content type="html">&lt;figure class="col s12"&gt;

a few moments in life when I knew exactly what to do next &amp;mdash; like
going home to put dad to rest. And even then, these moments were
always linked to something, sad. For the rest of life, it's just
taking each step w/ a roll of dice, sometimes lucky, sometimes not,
like dancing on a thin ice, feeling to sink at any moment, yet coasted
along when the ground magically held. Fate, destiny, God's
will. Nothing is in my control, yet I have to play the main role as if
I could decide the script. How strange.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Dad would like this music. She would, too. Zhu would not care
much. But I do. How I wish the living things I care about could be all
nearby, that I could see, could hear, could feel the warmth of their
body, feel the life inside them.. yet, one by one, they have left my
life, leaving me in this cold winter night, all alone. Though there
are so much I want to say and talk about, there is only the dark night
outside the window, pretty to look at, lights flashing on the building
far away.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What's the purpose of this life? any? I don't know. I will miss the
music, if I were now on a death bed. I will miss the beautiful beings,
a cat, a flower, a cloud, a sunset, a song, a smile, a coffee w/
friend, w/ one I love, a walk in Tokyo, a ride in train, a moment in a
temple, a visit to the Fine Arts, a bike ride on the Charles... these
are beauties in this world, they, make this journey worth
coming. Suddenly thought of the college days. Felt so far away, yet,
the young man is right here, in front of my eyes, how did he get to,
here? How did he become, the me, right here, now? What did he do over
these years, and how did he do? It's flashing by like a movie, seems
something had been captured, and replayed, but there is nothing there,
maybe a wish? Barely anything left. The past, forever, passed. This
movie has not yet stopped, and can't roll back. What's next? I don't
know. How will this movie end? It's not that interesting at all.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Music flows by. A cold cold winter night, this is already too good
to be true.&lt;/p&gt;</content><category term="thoughts"></category></entry><entry><title>2023 A Year</title><link href="https://fengxia41103.github.io/myblog/2023%20a%20year.html" rel="alternate"></link><published>2023-12-09T16:46:00-05:00</published><updated>2023-12-09T16:46:00-05:00</updated><author><name>Feng Xia</name></author><id>tag:fengxia41103.github.io,2023-12-09:/myblog/2023 a year.html</id><summary type="html">&lt;figure class="col s12"&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Sitting on the porch going through the photos of today's xmas
parade. Cool weather, 60s, quite comfortable. Cloud gathering, but the
sunset are still shining through cracks here and there. Listening to
this &lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wXLjjIi_2GM"&gt;youtube&lt;/a&gt;, Nagoya,
the temple which I wondered into in 2016. All of sudden the memory
dragged me back into time, 2016, the year I still had a home in
Shanghai, with you near by. Today's your birthday. Happy birthday, 美
丽的人, as always, wish the best to you, for having a good time in
life, wherever you are, whatever you do, and whomever you are with.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;2023 has been, a year of closure. With settling Dad in April, I
finally felt I could let go a weight on my mind, not that I had wished
his passing, but that I had finally made the trip home, to take care
of him. I hope what I did, the trip to Nanjing, the simple session
that only our closest family attended, would have been the way he
wanted to, to leave this …&lt;/p&gt;</summary><content type="html">&lt;figure class="col s12"&gt;

wanted to, to leave this world, finally. Like Coco, he is still
remembered, at least by me, so he is not yet vanishing, just that he
is now living in a different place, hopefully a better one than this
version of the world.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The music is touching. I remember the night I wondered back to the
temple, watching the sky, watching the people walking by, thinking of
my life and you, thinking of what was ahead of me... nothing could
have prepared me for the following years. From time to time I so
regret I let go your hand. But then, I reminded myself that even
though company would have been what I should have given you, letting
you fly is a better way, you are so young, so beautiful, so full of
possibilities, tied down with an old guy like me would have been
selfish. I would have had a good time, but in the end, you would
shoulder much of the burden I have had, and would possibly have in the
future, too. And to the end, I myself would become a burden to you. I
don't want it. I don't want to be a weight on you. Go fly, enjoy. Life
is a journey. Though I know the journey is tough and unpleasant, but
taking away the chance to experience it would be too selfish a thing
for me to do. When you are tired, beaten by life perhaps, want a way
out, here this place would be, a hide-out, that you would be able to
hide from this world, having all the comfort still, but could be
alone, by yourself, and like what I am doing right now, sitting on
this porch, watching the sky change, watching the cloud gathering,
watching the sunrise and sunset, and do you know that sunsets around
your birthday are always, always, so breathtaking!? I always feel
it's a sign, a destiny, that you were born at this time of the year,
that the evening has the best hue, just like you, being the most
beautiful in this world. So it is, meant to be.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Happy birthday.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Starting a new job on Monday. It feel that a chapter of my life is
being closed. Not that the new job would be that much different from
what I have had all along. But now with Dad passed away, myself moving
into a new job, I feel the age of 50 a beginning of some sort of
life. I don't know what lies ahead of me. Actually I don't even have
much thought or hope that how old I could eventually become. Maybe
it's truly a sign of depression, that I feel I could leave this world
at any moment. Like the podcase I listened, I don't regret coming into
this world, I had my fun. But I don't mind leaving now, either. It's
enough. I don't want to experience more, pain or merry, I have seen
them. I have loved, have lost my heart and my soul, have known what a
beauty is, what a kindness is, what all the good things this world
could offer are like. That's good enough for me. I may feel worried
about Noah, or any life of whom I may feel I could still offer
something, but in the end I know I did the best I know how. I won't be
able to accompany them till the end, so they will be on their own,
eventually. I wish all the best luck, as I am wishing for you, and
thank you for coming to my life! I love you, all.&lt;/p&gt;</content><category term="thoughts"></category><category term="thoughts"></category></entry><entry><title>Nikon DF split screen</title><link href="https://fengxia41103.github.io/myblog/nikon%20df%20split%20screen.html" rel="alternate"></link><published>2023-08-22T16:47:00-04:00</published><updated>2023-08-22T16:47:00-04:00</updated><author><name>Feng Xia</name></author><id>tag:fengxia41103.github.io,2023-08-22:/myblog/nikon df split screen.html</id><summary type="html">&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="" src="images/df/done.png"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;li&gt;There is a DPreview post, in which the guy basically saying "dont
   do it" cause you are going inevitably ruin both screens, and ended
   up with a handicapped camera.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The agony goes on and on. Then just before I started to wonder maybe
it's lost in mail and saved me from agonizing, it's here!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Package itself is low key. Just another international mail.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Inside you have the followings. I'm copying &amp;amp; pasting from a sheet
   included in the package which has a "Material list" section:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Focusing screen and original packing box&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Tweezers: Picking focusing screen's edge or mount tab to
     exchange.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Fingerstall&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Transparent pad: It's used to adjust focus.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Special tools: For some difficult installation, special tools
     can help to unlock.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Everything is wrapped in a clear plastic wrap, then a bubble wrap.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;camera position&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In &lt;a href="https://richardhaw.com/2016/09/11/mod-nikon-df-split-prism/"&gt;his blog&lt;/a&gt;, shots are showing the camera in &lt;strong&gt;normal&lt;/strong&gt;
position. You can tell by the aperture contact on the top of the
screen mount. When I was doing it, mine was upside down &amp;mdash; it
sits on the flash mount side, because the screen &lt;strong&gt;will not fall out&lt;/strong&gt;
if I disengage the metal clip which holds it down.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Note: the camera won't sit by itself. I had left hand holding it in
that position. You could use some help or whatever to achieve
this. The idea is the same. It doesn't need to be 90 degree straight
as long as the screen won't just fall out by gravity.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is important because it will then give me the chance to pause and
think about how to remove it. After all, I'm new to this like anyone!
Be slow an cautious.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;the screen&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="" src="images/df/canon.png"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The screen sits inside the Canon box. As mentioned in other places,
this screen is essentially a Canon screen w/ some customization to fit
DF size. The entire package was &lt;strong&gt;mint&lt;/strong&gt;! I don't know how they could
have done this without leaving even a finger print or crumpling some
paper packaging material. Well done!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The screen sits inside a plastic box in the package as if it were
originally made by Canon! Everything is mint!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="" src="images/df/tweezer.png"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There is a small plastic tool in the box w/ the screen. It seems to be
for grabbing the tab of the screen. But it's &lt;strong&gt;difficult to use&lt;/strong&gt;. I
tried to use it to grab the DF screen out. But it's too clumsy to be
useful. I would &lt;strong&gt;not recommend&lt;/strong&gt; using it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The screen has two sides, one matte, one glossy. The original screen
has glossy side facing down if installed. So is the new one. The
easiest way to remember this is that &lt;strong&gt;the tab is on your right-hand
side&lt;/strong&gt; if it's installed, the camera is upstraight, and you are
looking at the camera through the lens mount. When I was installing
it, my camera was &lt;strong&gt;upside-down&lt;/strong&gt; (sitting on its flash mount), thus
the tab &lt;strong&gt;is on the left-hand side&lt;/strong&gt;. With this as additional
reference, you simply &lt;strong&gt;will not install it in the wrong way&lt;/strong&gt;. This
is like computer, parts can only be installed into the slot in one way
due to the design. Same principle applies here. This was a major
concern to me. So if this is also yours, rest assured.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;special tool&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="" src="images/df/special.png"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the instruction it's called "special tool". In practice, this is
&lt;strong&gt;the tool&lt;/strong&gt; you want to use! Notice the tiny lip at the end? It's
perfect to push onto the metal wire clip to release the screen! I say
&lt;em&gt;push&lt;/em&gt; because, again, my camera is upside down. Actually I found
&lt;strong&gt;pushing&lt;/strong&gt; motion gives you more control over how much force you
apply, and sense how tightly the wire clip is being latched.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My biggest fear was if the tool slips, then scratch my screen. So
first of all, make sure the tool is about 90 degree to the wire. &lt;strong&gt;You
don't want to push side ways&lt;/strong&gt;. Then, feel how well the lip is against
the wire. I put it onto the wire a couple times just to get a feel,
like stepping on the gas pedal of a new car. On my 3rd try, the wire
just popped open!!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Honestly I wasn't even ready for it! I felt the wire was not even
latched properly to begin with!! WTF!? But anyway. No more
hesitation. The show is on!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;rubber finger condom&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="" src="images/df/condom.png"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I don't know what it's called. It's just like condom. I decided to put
them on my left hand index finger and thumb, because I'm going to use
them to grab the screen, which in the end was exactly how I did it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I deliberately left my right hand bare, so it's the tool hand. I
decided that I will not use it touch the screen unless it's an
emergency, which, if happened, is pretty much a mission failed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;how to remove the screen&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As mentioned, I tried that plastic tool first. It's too big for the
lens mount space, and the tab is on my left hand side, so using the
right hand to use this tool makes even harder. After maybe 2 tries I
just give it all up.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;With the wire clip unlatched, the screen is about to fall if you tilt
the camera. I wanted to have some control of this process. So first
thing I did was to use a tweezer to hold the wire so that it will not
let the screen completely out-of-control. I didn't use tweezer to grab
the screen because tweezer is metal, and I didn't want to scratch the
screen.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now with tweezer controls the clip like a door, I could have some
breathing time to see how to grab the screen. In the end, I just used
the two fingers w/ condom to grab the screen, and off it's out! My
heart was pounding like hell at this moment.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Then, I looked at the two sides of the screen, and note which side
facing which direction. As said before, the glossy side facing down
after installed (when camera in normal position), and the matte size
is facing the viewfinder.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;install new screen&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;New screen has matte and glossy sides, also. I then further confirmed
the direction by the tab's position. Then, still using the condom
fingers to grab the screen, I just drop it in. By gravity, it sits
right into the housing. I tilted the camera side ways, but didn't see
any give. So &lt;strong&gt;the screen has been cut-to-size&lt;/strong&gt;, and there is no room
to play! This is good.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Put the wire back&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Getting the wire back was a bit more than I expected. Using the same
special tool, pushing onto the wire, but this time having a bit
downward motion so it will go under the plastic latch clip. I didn't
want to put too much force onto the wire fearing it will fail or the
tool slip. So it took me 4-5 tries before it went it. The last one I
had to put on a bit of force, so &lt;strong&gt;be aware&lt;/strong&gt;. As before, make sure
the tool is 90 degrees more-or-less to the wire, so it will not slip.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I was hoping to hear a "clicking" sound as proof, &lt;strong&gt;but I didn't&lt;/strong&gt;. I
could, however, feel the &lt;strong&gt;engagement&lt;/strong&gt; through the tool, like a
tiny vibration. So trust your finger and sense.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;shims&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="" src="images/df/shim.png"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;No idea. I didn't play with the shims. I have no heart to do this
again. It front-focus a bit. But hell, I will just develop muscle
memory to shift a tiny bit when the split says perfect, then I'm dead
on. This is much easier than playing with the shims. So no idea why
there are two types of shims &amp;mdash; one transparent plastic, one with
brown rim. Different thickness? Well well, I'm leaving them alone.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;afterthought&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It works very well! I'm not totally old school, but I enjoy this
additional assistance. I actually don't know what's the trick of
using split screen when I'm shooting things that are not at the
center. But well well, DF now feels the way it should be by design.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I highly recommend &lt;a href="https://www.focusingscreen.com/index.php?cPath=22_139&amp;amp;osCsid=2fa371v2s71klbv2o6lbrh6l02"&gt;this vendor&lt;/a&gt; if you are thinking to try out a
split screen on whichever digital camera you have. It's professional,
well made, and worth a shot.&lt;/p&gt;</content><category term="thoughts"></category><category term="thoughts"></category></entry><entry><title>Oshin</title><link href="https://fengxia41103.github.io/myblog/oshin.html" rel="alternate"></link><published>2023-08-13T18:01:00-04:00</published><updated>2023-08-13T18:01:00-04:00</updated><author><name>Feng Xia</name></author><id>tag:fengxia41103.github.io,2023-08-13:/myblog/oshin.html</id><summary type="html">&lt;figure class="col s12"&gt;

&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;At age 50, I watched Oshin again, and found myself understand much of
this movie now. I remember the moments when my mom was in tears
watching this, and I couldn't understand at all why she would do
that. I was about Noah's age. Now, even without going through as much
as Oshin had, without suffering the pain of war, I could not help
knowing why it's so touching. What an epic, really, the misery of
life, of the era, of the terrible ordeal a human must go through, and
how fleeting a life really is. In the end, what is remaining? The
names would be all gone, forgotten, the stories buried, and who would
have ever remember there had been such a person, such an emotion, such
a struggle, be it a villain or a hero!?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I have been fortunate so far. Yet, I could feel the tie between theirs
and mine. Maybe it's the feeling of loss of someone you endear, love, or
something, or a moment which you could never live again …&lt;/p&gt;</summary><content type="html">&lt;figure class="col s12"&gt;

hard. Really. Life is a drama that is so full of surprise and regrets,
that it felt sometimes too long to bear, and sometimes too short to
dare. One keeps moving forward, day by day, not knowing what is ahead,
where is the end, yet one strives to be meaningful, happy,
satisfied.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Perhaps the only thing that is always meaningful, is the heart of
gold, to be kind, to give someone in distress a hand, to be grateful
if receiving such, and to live truthful to yourself. Dust to dust,
scattered in the wind, leaving no trace, but a feel.&lt;/p&gt;</content><category term="thoughts"></category><category term="thoughts"></category></entry><entry><title>Today's China is sickening</title><link href="https://fengxia41103.github.io/myblog/china%20sickening.html" rel="alternate"></link><published>2023-07-27T09:04:00-04:00</published><updated>2023-07-27T09:04:00-04:00</updated><author><name>Feng Xia</name></author><id>tag:fengxia41103.github.io,2023-07-27:/myblog/china sickening.html</id><summary type="html">&lt;figure class="col s12"&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This news hit me. As a father w/ my son at the same age as these
girls, I felt very sad. I can not imagine how I would take such a
thing if it happened on Noah. The center of my universe would have
collapsed, and there is nothing left for me to hold on in this world,
this life. If I ever survived such a blow, I would nothing but a
walking zombie without emotion but hatred, of myself, of the harsh
things I have done to Noah when he was little, of his requests which I
failed to meet, of moments I didn't choose to be with him... regret
will be like a virus eating my heart from inside out until a death
would look like a much better option than breathing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Sad.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I feel this anger inside me, like cloud rising. I'll be a coward,
perhaps, just like the parents who were waiting in the hospital while
&lt;em&gt;under control&lt;/em&gt; of those authorities. But I can't. I'll feel such an
urge to attack …&lt;/p&gt;</summary><content type="html">&lt;figure class="col s12"&gt;

urge to attack, to grab his fxxk neck and go into a fight, so that
it's better than suffering the misery of being powerless to save. How
familiar it is when they were asked to sign a paper of death before
they could look at their children even for identification
purpose. Isn't this the same, regular, standard move when I was asked
to sign dad's paper? I remember that. I hate, not the puppet sent by the
bureaucracy, but the bureaucracy itself, the 院长 who is a coward... I
guess, in the end, I hate cowardice, in myself and in others.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Chapel Hill had a bad fire this weekend. Noah and I went to the
scene. When I couldn't find him for a while, I felt nearly a panic
strike. But after I remember the kid said to me before he asked to run
ahead by himself to the scene:"I want to go and check what I could
help." At the time I warned him to stay away from the scene, certainly
the idea, because I don't him to be unsafe. But, now writing this when
all these have passed, I feel proud of him &amp;mdash; it's a noble first
instinct. When someday he were the one stepping forward to shoulder a
tough burden, I wouldn't be surprised. I will feel very sad if he is
harmed, but I would always feel proud that he were not a coward.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;China, that piece of land, which I grew up, and felt to heart at some
point in my life, is now sickening. I can't imagine the policemen, who
is about in his 40s or 50s, could face another father losing his child
without feeling the pain. I won't be able to hold myself. Duty, isn't
the opposite of empathy. I would have given them a hug, tearing with
them, do what I can to bring dignity to them and the children. 一路走
好, is an empty phrase. I would rather say, keep your pride, know the
pain this has given to the livings, it's really tough. But also, know
their love will not disappear, whichever world you are.&lt;/p&gt;</content><category term="thoughts"></category><category term="thoughts"></category></entry><entry><title>Chinese superstition</title><link href="https://fengxia41103.github.io/myblog/chinese%20superstition.html" rel="alternate"></link><published>2023-07-18T19:08:00-04:00</published><updated>2023-07-18T19:08:00-04:00</updated><author><name>Feng Xia</name></author><id>tag:fengxia41103.github.io,2023-07-18:/myblog/chinese superstition.html</id><summary type="html">&lt;figure class="col s12"&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Browsing Zhihu is depressing these days. Constantly I came across
titles which I could only call, thus the title, &lt;strong&gt;chinese
superstition&lt;/strong&gt;. Not only that many there are indeed superstitious in
the conventional sense, but that the brainwash education and
propaganda have further done damage that there are some only could be

as some strong evidence to back up a statement, which then by the

&lt;p&gt;Since this is quite a phenomenon, I'd like to keep a note here, just
for the fun of it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Conclusion in shape of a question&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is a common practice, that a statement/opinion is posted in shape
of a question, eg. "为什么说中华文明对世界的贡献远大于西方文明". Don't
be fooled by the "why". It has nothing to do w/ seeking an
answer. Rather, it is a clear statement w/ a comparison (it always has
a "A is better than B" frame!), which the author is already
opinionated. Thus, the comments could only be a heated argument that
one side debates another.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This makes me wonder, what is a question? I don't want to use the word
"good" because an adjective makes this even harder to answer. A
question, in my mind, should be a phrase seeking a &lt;em&gt;truth&lt;/em&gt; of
something. It should be neutral, taking no side yet one way or
another, but focus on the &lt;em&gt;thing&lt;/em&gt; at hand, the phenomenon, the
symptom, the known. I don't know whether you absolutely can not ask a
sided question like this. If this is indeed the point you are seeking
more insights, I think this is just as valid. However, they are not
genuine when seen on those Chinese forums &amp;mdash; they are simply a
provocative line that fans a flame. This actually reminds tactics of
both the Nazi's and those professional revolutioners'. If so, then
this again casts a shaddy shadow on such question forms. Sometimes it
makes me wonder why Nazi and communist so look alike!? Genetics?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;中华&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It's pretty funny how Chinese are considering this word
indisputable. I disagree. First of all, this is pretty much a racial
term in their mind because it certainly extends way beyond the scope
of geography. Dragged in a time axis, this term can include anything
that has a faint hint of an intercourse w/ anything they consider to
be their own. Like Decarte's "therefore I am", they need a single
anchor to start a whole universe. Thus, as long as they can find such
an anchor, which by way are plenty to grab, some solid and some bogus
(which I will touch upon in other sections), they can extend its reach
to infinity and beyond.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Just look at the three categories they love the most: racial,
geographical, cultural.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;First, geo. This is the easiest to visualize. As long as you ever put
a single toe on the soil of anywhere between the old and/or new of its
border, it's a 中华 by definition. This makes it convenient then that
using the largest ever map would be beneficial. So by this thread
Roman could pretty much declare quite some &lt;em&gt;Roman descendants&lt;/em&gt;, the
Great Britian could say half of world is still Great Britian, and the
most strong support for Chinese is, Mongols. Thanks for their effort,
the world was either Chinese or influenced (&lt;strong&gt;always in a beneficial
way, of course&lt;/strong&gt;) by the Chinese.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Second, racial. If Mongol had European look, that could have spoiled
the fun. But how wonderful! Instead of Chinese being categorized as a
Mongo look, it's turned around that Mongo is nothing but a strain in
the overall 中华 race. This concept, 中华, will have hard time to fly
if racial difference is, obvious &amp;rarr; it's far fetched already to
call all the 56 races 中华 despite that Uyghur people apparently look
more central Asian than 中华 residents. So even though Mongo invaded
Europe, thanks to their different racial profile, they have to wait
even today to be included as 中华. Sorry. But other than that, China
is pretty taking itself as the sole gene pool for the entire Asia!
Even though seagoing wasn't China's forte, but hell, sperms could
swim, right!? Why can't they swim around the Atlantic and make
everywhere 中华. So they must have.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Thirdly, cultural. Well. This is a catch-all. Geo could be seen on
planet earth. Race has definition. But cultural, particular if using
their term, the "influenced by", has no boundary. What makes a 中华
culture? what is not? and how can anything &lt;strong&gt;not to be influenced&lt;/strong&gt;
by, anything!? This way of thinking has just manifested recently in
its Covid time when China made up the term "时空传染" &amp;larr; just like
culture, it passes in the air, in your dream... &amp;mdash; the key is,
you can't prove innocent. Period.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There you have it, the 中华. I'm pretty sure Martians were influenced
by 中华, also. Just wait till they show up so I could prove it to you.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;中华文明&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This, as always used in the context of the four ancient civilization,
which accordingly was promoted by 梁启超, is a super weapon of
nationalism.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;First, it's recent but appears hold. His days, February 23, 1873 –
January 19, 1929. So giving 20 years to maturity, we are looking at
this line being put out around 1893 or later. Yet, this is freely
quoted as if this was written by Jesus, stamped approval by
Buddha, and carved in stone by Gia herself. While Zhihuers sneers at
US for its &lt;em&gt;short&lt;/em&gt; history, they don't think twice a phrase less than
half US's age is, undependable!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Second, &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Civilization"&gt;civilization&lt;/a&gt;. This is a total misnomer. It's focus is on
the have vs. have-not. As long as you have those categories you are a
civilization. Whether it's a &lt;em&gt;good&lt;/em&gt; one or &lt;em&gt;bad&lt;/em&gt; one, hard to
tell. Therefore, I think there is nothing be proud of simply because
China is a civilization. Just watched a document the other day on
Aztec civilization, in which a captured warrior was tied to pole w/ a
rope while fighting to his death w/ other warriors &amp;mdash; he was to
be sacrificed to winner's god, in a slow, bloody way. It's a
civilization, alright. But it's disgusting.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;文明, is meant for something nice, pleasant, satisfying. However, I
found little such traits in Aztec's civilization, nor in the 中华文明.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;西方&lt;blank&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I don't know whether it's Kant or Hague who must make the world A
vs. B. It's definitely Nazi's way, so is today China's. It's starting
from annoying to now nonsensical that any dimension could be split
along the line of 东方 vs. 西方, whereas 东方 could be further tied to
a &lt;strong&gt;Chinese influence&lt;/strong&gt; which I have talked about earlier in 中华
section. Therefore, the split is conveniently becoming China vs. 西方.
But I would say, doing so is to China's disadvantage.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;First, 西方 is much bigger than China. It's pretty obvious that
counting by any dimension &amp;mdash; land, population, resource &amp;mdash;
&lt;code&gt;(world - China)&lt;/code&gt; is greater than &lt;code&gt;China&lt;/code&gt;. Period. Carving the world
like is even sillier than the Pope carving the globe for Spain and
Portugal, which, btw, was in 1494. 529 years later, China still thinks
this way.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Second, competition instead of collaboration. Once you draw a line
between mine and theirs, how are you to benefit from theirs if theirs
are good? Only one of two ways now, take or steal, and that's exactly
what China is doing these years. When science has brought the entire
mankind out of dark age, having such a view could only hurt your own
chance of survival. Stupid.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Third, who is the barbarian? Deep down in their brainwash scheme, it's
pretty funny that you would find ancient Greek in its action &amp;mdash;
the world has two groups of people, the Greeks, and the
barbarians. China thinks they are the Greeks. I'm quite sure those
barbarians were joking about those Greeks being monkeys, too. What
this reveals is a self-centered view point that was valid 2000 years
ago, but trashy in 2023.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;5000 years, and continuous&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is the Chinese superstition in the making. 5000!? wouldn't 4999
be a better one by Chinese taste?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;First, archaeology hasn't proved it. All culture have some mythology
that start with the origin of human, and of course, them being the
direct bloodline of that.
But counting your calendar by that is for
maniacs. Who takes it to heart that Jesus was born exactly on the 0
year of our calendar, conveniently or coincidentally!? It's nothing
but a counter. But if you take it seriously, what a fool!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Second, non-broken. Well, if using any of the three 中华 threads, it's
perceivable that as long as there is human on earth, we could
certainly call it non-broken. After all, it's pretty much implied that
all human have one gene or two by China's origin, whatever it may
be. Mine is mine, yours is mine. Too bad China hasn't yet come up a
theory to conclude that Greeks were indeed migrants from, "China", so
that its history covers this planet end-to-end.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;why always me&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is inferior complex. Why 受伤的总是我. The 100 years of 屈辱 is
like a birth mark on every single Chinese today as if there is an
original sin. If pounding a children over and over to believe in
his/her deficiency at birth is criminal, then a government doing such
to its citizen is also a crime.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now, like wearing a filter in front of eyes, this world is forever the
color of this filter. So, there is 总有人想害朕. The world is hating
China. US is targeting China. All are barbarians at gate, 图我的钱财或
是美貌.... so on and on. The bottom line is, I am always 对的.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Give me a break.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;自古以来&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I have already reasoned that introducing a time dimension such as the
5000-year-history is problematic. But at least there is a fixed
number. With a phrase of 自古以来, there is no boundary. Futher, the "
古" can be thought for 盘古, the mythical figure who split heaven from
earth out of a big chaos, &lt;strong&gt;the very first being&lt;/strong&gt;, the start of this
earth life as we know it. Therefore, this carries an ambiguous tone
that can be easily extended to that far. But that just means it
includes absolutely anything human has ever known since the clock
started. So no wonder using this is convenient for the Chinese to feel
that anything humanly possible is, his.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Even with its &lt;em&gt;constrained&lt;/em&gt; form, there is simply no rule of how much
further such a backtracing can go &amp;mdash; 100 years? 200
years?.... thus, it becomes completely arbitrary as the argument
needs. Slapping this time decorator onto any topic, it becomes a
&lt;em&gt;historical "fact"&lt;/em&gt;! But it certainly invites a question whenever it's
used &amp;rarr; why stop here!? Why not trace further back? If Tibet is so
as "自古以来" since the Qing dynasty, well, how about it at Ming's
time? or Qin's time? of 盘古's time? Really. What determines your
time-of-choice being the one while all others are invalid? Such is the
BS. I always joked about that according to such time magic, not only
自古以来Austria is China's, but our history will be enriched by such
historical figures &amp;mdash; Beethoven, Mozart, and quite recently,
Hitler.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Do you really want this? I don't.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;华人&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is a flexible term whose scope shifts constantly, just like the
Yellow River's pass. I don't know what dimension it operated on. Since
I have already discussed geo, race, time, culture, let me touch upon
another one here, which is used/implied by this term to manifest its
weight &amp;mdash; bloodline.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If ever you had a &lt;em&gt;Chinese&lt;/em&gt; ascendants, and god knows how far you
trace, you get the &lt;em&gt;blood&lt;/em&gt;, thus. This makes me wonder, does relative
count? how far out of my family tree can I go until I invalidate such
identity? For immigrants this is a pretty real question, and it's
really a math question &amp;larr; keep dividing by 2, the bloodline draws
pretty thin after, say, 10 generation, and forget about 64 generations
and beyond. And what if, 23th generation down the line, my guy/girl
marries another full-blood chinese (if there were even such a thing!)?
Does it reset the counter? or prorate &lt;code&gt;(1/(2^23)+1)/2&lt;/code&gt;? Compounded?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But it's not quite right, either. Looking at the Qing Dynasty, the
ruling class, at least the royal family, kept their bloodline
&lt;em&gt;pure&lt;/em&gt;. So, were they 华人? If no, what was theirs, whether good or
evil, wasn't 华人's, either. So, why should I feel proud of theirs
achievement, or shame of their wrong doings? As a matter of fact, they
were the 鞑虏, weresn't they? The convenience of this term is that it
shares all the honor you earn, and bears no responsibility of any kind
&amp;mdash; if you get a recognition, well, you are a 华人, regardless
where you are, who you are, what your ancestors were, when they ever
left the land, as long you have that Mongol look, you are 华人.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So, I would say, this is a category of your "look" &amp;rarr; sounds
racist now, doesn't it!?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;laundry list&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I would not have thought the word 苏州 had popped up in the headline
news because of such a
&lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jjDcXXNjWU0"&gt;tragedy&lt;/a&gt;. But the
aftermath of many netizen comments is really what I want to talk
about here.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It's quite common that the act of this woman being painted as a
savior of a national pride, which, regardless my disagreement of the
comment itself, is also implying that the pride is in a decline in
recent times. Thus, a heroic event such as this became a counter argument
of such decline, saying that not all are lost, not all are bad people,
and there are still good eggs left, which usually also implying that
majority of &lt;em&gt;us&lt;/em&gt; are the good eggs.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;However, this is a flawed logic. Period. The act of this person proved
one thing, and one thing alone, that she was a hero. She, herself, no
one else but herself, was a good egg. She had no intention to
represent anyone else, nor she had any obligation, or right, to
represent anyone other than …&lt;/p&gt;</summary><content type="html">&lt;figure class="col s12"&gt;

one else but herself, was a good egg. She had no intention to
represent anyone else, nor she had any obligation, or right, to
represent anyone other than herself. This statement holds true to
everyone of us here. The comment seems elevating her to a height as if
bestowing a glory. Further, it even carried a tone that a commoner as
such is now being recognized on a stage, which, as the rule if not the
law, is reserved only to the privilege, because being on this stage
can only be allowed if some highup gives the nod.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What a nonsense!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This so called glory is not a glory at all. This praise is not a
praise for the mere reason that it is insincere, untrue, and
unwanted. She did not ask for this, nor had consented being put on
such a stage. On the contrary, I'm certain that she didn't want this
tragedy to happen at all, let alone she paid the dearest price! What
is happening is that her body is being dragged out of peace, laying on
a platform under a spot light, words forced into &lt;strong&gt;her own mouth&lt;/strong&gt;
so to back up a theory, a justification, an evidence, while none of
these had previously paid slightest attention of her!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What a shameful play! This is not a glory you are awarding her! This,
is killing her twice! thrice!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What will happen to her tragedy then after this five minute of fame?
Flushed away just like another piece of toilet paper that had wiped
some shit off the dirty ass. Shame. Total, shame.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Stop linking her to those political BS, those nationalistic BS, those
cultural, historical BS. Her heroism has nothing to do w/ stopping the
decline of the national pride, of proving that Chinese still have
moral left, of having still some good eggs left. Stop using her to
wipe clean anyone's ass, mine included. Each of us is an
individual. I'm responsible for my own behavior, my own decision, my
own judgment, not much of my own fate but I try, and my own
conscience. So should we all be. Only then, when we could look at
ourselves as such, and look at her as such, there is then a hope no
more nationalism, no more cultural revolution, no more stupidity, no
more manipulation, and no more such senseless tragedy.&lt;/p&gt;</content><category term="thoughts"></category><category term="thoughts"></category></entry><entry><title>Causal history</title><link href="https://fengxia41103.github.io/myblog/causal%20history.html" rel="alternate"></link><published>2023-06-19T15:25:00-04:00</published><updated>2023-06-19T15:25:00-04:00</updated><author><name>Feng Xia</name></author><id>tag:fengxia41103.github.io,2023-06-19:/myblog/causal history.html</id><summary type="html">&lt;figure class="col s12"&gt;

&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It's a common title line of a history book or Youtube that goes
something like this, "大明亡于一只鸡", which builds a causal
relationship between &lt;em&gt;major&lt;/em&gt; event and a &lt;em&gt;trivial&lt;/em&gt; event. It's usually
quite interesting to listen to such a story, but I had a second
thought.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We all know the cliche that we are what we are because of all the
previous days, hours, minutes and seconds, no more and no less, all
combined, lump summed into this moment, so that I'm now sitting here
writing these lines and having these thoughts. Without eating the
previous 8 buns, the 9th one won't become fulfilling. A change of
anything in history would then result in a butterfly effect that it
changes the future, permanently, the unbearable lightness of being...&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So, with these in mind, there must be a chain reaction leading to the
&lt;em&gt;major&lt;/em&gt; even in focus, whereas every single step, regardless how
minute and trivial at the time it took place, resulted in the final
moment when the &lt;em&gt;major&lt;/em&gt; even …&lt;/p&gt;</summary><content type="html">&lt;figure class="col s12"&gt;

minute and trivial at the time it took place, resulted in the final
moment when the &lt;em&gt;major&lt;/em&gt; even happened. Therefore, every single step is
&lt;strong&gt;a cause&lt;/strong&gt;! We could argue that some steps are weightier than others,
but they are nonetheless all &lt;strong&gt;causes&lt;/strong&gt;. Therefore, we can pick any
historical moment, and pick another one before it, and call it a
causal!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But wait a minute! Isn't this make a history, or any history analysis,
a mocking joke? And if all causal become so casual, are there any
point of building any causal relationship anymore? The bun analogy is
actually a poor one because each bun is staged as the same (amount of
food), which buns of history came in all shape and form and
ingredient. It's certainly one view to name the 8th &lt;em&gt;bun&lt;/em&gt; being the
fatal blow of a historical tragedy, but wouldn't a view of naming the
7th chicken being equally valid? or the wine the hero drank when he
was twelve!?..... This makes me wonder whether there is some clear
rules of building a causal reasoning in general or in history in
particular.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Me: can one build a causal reasoning of any two historical events?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;ChatGPT: Yes, it is possible to construct a causal reasoning for any
two historical events. Causal reasoning allows us to analyze and
explain the causes and effects that connect events, even if they are
seemingly unrelated. By identifying the factors and circumstances that
contributed to each event, we can establish a logical and coherent
understanding of how they are causally connected. However, the depth
and complexity of the causal analysis may vary depending on the
availability of historical evidence and the degree of scholarly
consensus surrounding the events in question.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So indeed. The difference lies in the strength of your argument, not
whether you can or can not. You always can. Interesting.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But, what about science then!? Isn't it the whole point of it is to
build causal reasoning? Here is a snippet from &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Causal_reasoning#:~:text=Causal%20reasoning%20is%20the%20process,event%20preceding%20a%20later%20one."&gt;wiki&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We say a cause causes an effect if and only if there exists a 100%
perfect correlation (positive or negative) between the cause and the
effect when and only when all other possible variables are controlled
for (a 100% degree of confidence). In these cases these effects are
called dependent variables, and causes are called independent
variables (so named because the dependent variable(s) depend on the
independent variable(s), and the independent variable(s) do not depend
on any other variable).
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It is possible, theoretically. But then, who determines that &lt;code&gt;100%&lt;/code&gt;!? Muddy.&lt;/p&gt;</content><category term="thoughts"></category><category term="thoughts"></category></entry><entry><title>Dad trip</title><link href="https://fengxia41103.github.io/myblog/dad%20trip.html" rel="alternate"></link><published>2023-05-08T16:19:00-04:00</published><updated>2023-05-08T16:19:00-04:00</updated><author><name>Feng Xia</name></author><id>tag:fengxia41103.github.io,2023-05-08:/myblog/dad trip.html</id><summary type="html">&lt;figure class="col s12"&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Finally, came back from this tiring trip. Having Dad in rest is a
great relief. I don't feel the same level of hurt anymore inside
myself. Though tears would still well when I think of him sometimes,
but not as painful as before. I am glad that the scarf that Noah and I
bought together are now blanketing him. Hope it will keep him warm,
safe, and in peace.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The trip was a tiring one. Friend said I was trying to pack too much
into too late time. But they couldn't imagine how stressful and home

that you have to plan for which city you will go to, where to stay,
how to get there, how to get to the city, the hotel, how to get
around, and how to get back.... every a couple days you have to think
of and plan for these. The stress of not knowing where you will a few
days ahead troubles me. It's not the anxiety of planning but the
general feeling of drifting that was exhausting. Then, adding on top
of these, having to put off putting Dad to rest due to the stupid
reunion my mom was going to was just too much for my patience and
love. I wanted to be friendly and accommodating to her and her
plans. But being so self-centered and caring so little of Dad and my
feelings made me sick. Besides, Zhu's strong reaction of my plan of
putting Dad to rest early made me angry. I respect her point of view,
but I felt the argument was won only because I didn't want to
completely alienate her for my mom's sake. It felt like a having a
hostage in someone's hand, a feeling which I hate. It's probably a
feeling of betrayal, also, that everyone seems to have an agenda
running this as a show in which my Dad is nothing but a decor on
stage. Everyone wants to at the center stage, but the real main actor,
he, is brushed aside and couldn't be cared less as long as he, or
should I say his ashes, is there when called for. This whole alluded
idea of such a show sickens me. They criticized my plan of being rush
and unconventional and so on and on... but they had no idea how
agonizing it is that I had to go through the hellish weeks last May to
sign off his death, then waited all these days to see him and be able
to do something for him, even though this something is to bring his
death to an conclusion. I knew what it would be like when so called
ceremony takes place according to their schedule and idea. But it
would be, and was, such a superficial one, that it shares nothing of
the burden I felt on my heart. If sadness could be felt, it would have
been silent. The silence, is what I think he should have for his
coming home. Am I being selfish, inconsiderate? I say No. I hate
superficial things, superficial people, and superficial tears. They
are not even cheap, they are simply an insult in my eyes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;phone number is the new SSN&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Traveling in China is a trivial matter if you don't have a local phone
number under your name. The phone number is the &lt;em&gt;new social security
number&lt;/em&gt; over there. The logic train goes like this: your identity
&amp;rarr; phone number &amp;rarr; bank account &amp;rarr; wechat &amp;rarr; 12306 or
any other apps &amp;rarr; you can use the service of the app. This &lt;em&gt;other
apps&lt;/em&gt; includes everything you could think of that involves someone at
the entrance like a guarding dog. Therefore, the chain at work is like
this: at the entrance of the service you want to use, a QR code &amp;rarr;
scan code will force you to install an app specifically designed for
this service, only &amp;rarr; after install, use wechat to SSO, grant
whatever permission the app asks (you &lt;strong&gt;must agree&lt;/strong&gt;, otherwise app
installation bails) &amp;rarr; generate a QR code &amp;rarr; scan it as
entrance or show to the person guarding the door &amp;rarr; you can now
use the service. This same sequence applies to all the &lt;em&gt;services&lt;/em&gt; you
would use in life:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Buy a subway/bus ticket&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Buy a train ticket. I used Expedia for air ticket and passport was sufficient.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Hail a cab&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Go to a museum, any tourist site including a public park&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Order at restaurant&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Buy a toilet paper at a public restroom&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It becomes insane, in my opinion, that anything starts w/ you scan a
QR code which leads to either installing an app or a link to a website
page. Either would ask for your granting a list of permissions to it
eg. contacts, photos, and SSO w/ your money managing app such as
wechat or alipay. I could understand requiring an ID to ride a train,
but I am at limit why they need that to ride a subway. Out of the row
of ticket vending machines, only one accepts cash, and only of
denomination of RMB1 coin, or RMB 5 or 10 paper cash. Nothing
else. Asking the girl at service desk to buy a ticket, "go scan the
code". "Can I break a 20 to 10s and 5s?" "No I don't have such
service". I had to break this insane loop by buying a bottle of sth
from a convenient store w/ my RMB20 bill, use the coin change to buy a
RMB2 ticket, drink the water at security check point, promise I won't
drink it on the train, and used the other coins to help other locals
who got stuck just like I was a few minutes ago. Insane, isn't it!?
This is the reality that many were living through, but 90% of the
people were happy about using the app, and we the minority group were
left in the rust by technology wonders, and looked upon by others that
we should be ashamed of ourselves coming out the public like this. The
place is not a technically advanced, it is sickening, the sick of
broadlight discrimination in disguise of technology, the sick of some
developer who faithfully implemented a bullying requirement as if a
German solider pulls a gas chamber switch because he was only
following a command, the sick of designer of such system had little
respect of people who couldn't manage the &lt;em&gt;happy path&lt;/em&gt;, the sick of
millions who jump through such man-made stupid whoops without
complaints, and the sick of everyone else who felt nothing wrong of
all these when they passed the door w/ their newly generate QR
code. The whole idea, the whole scene, was sickening. This land is
sick, really. It used to be one I enjoyed walking around, watching its
change and progress, laughs at its silly english translation but feels
warm of its efforts behind these mistakes... not anymore. It's a sick
place full of arrogance, self-admiration, brag, indifference, and
unkindness.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;At a noodle shop&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ordered a noodle at a noodle shop. Giving the ticket to the chef. Took
a seat waiting for my turn. Then three people came in. After giving
the chef their tickets, two men stuck themselves right at counter
window where chef would pass on the noodles. I had a hunch I'd better
go to the window before someone hijacks my food. Just then the chef
called out my noodle and I raised my hand to grab it. "Excuse me!" I
said to the man who was literally blocking the delivery window and
squeezed between himself and the window to grab my food. "How come he
orders the same noodle as mine!?" this man was genuinely said that to
my face to express his surprise "Well, isn't this so hard to
understand?" I shot back. I was angry. What type of stupidity could it
be that having someone order the same noodle in a noodle shop who has
but a couple dozen on the menu to choose from!? What really annoyed me
is that his comment wasn't of a surprise he felt of a duplicate order,
but he was unhappy someone was ahead of him taking the noodle which he
thought should be his despite there could be other customers before
his order. So the bottom line of his logic is that he is the center of
the universe the moment he walks in the door, that the entire shop
starts churning for his food, and he should be served asap while no
other in this roof matters. Calling this stupidity is an
understatement. This, is pure, selfish that is bloated out of
proportion, on a common ordinary guy who rides a electric scooter and
eats a bowl of noodle for food. What gives him that idea!? He was like
a fly nearly falling into my noodle soap, as disgusting as someone
nearly put a finger in your food, and it was a too close a call.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Nanjing, a city of "mocking"&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Nanjing was a pretty city judging by its trees along the streets. They
wouldn't have grown to this size if not having a long history
behind. But the entire city reminds me but one word, &lt;strong&gt;mocking&lt;/strong&gt;. I
felt sad if Dad could see what I saw. The white marble statue of Sun
was covered w/ dark gray or black dust. No one who walked the room
paid any attention to his words on the wall. They were more fascinated
speculating a locked door behind the statue that his body, or
treasure, is there. The entire tourist site only exists because of his
status and death. Yet most of us, the tourists, acknowledging his
greatness by paying the entrance fee, climbing the stairs for a good
view, but of little to none of his idea, what his dreamed country
should be like, and the dust on his statue. So he, as great as all the
words has made him, is like a monkey on a chain, or a tiger in a cage,
that the owner is interested in selling the tickets for money, and
this monkey, now being a marble one, doesn't even need to be fed. How
convenient. Same goes for all the other places of Guomindang
governments &amp;larr; the people who used to work there are villains, so
they say, selling this country for whatever, but we love their beds,
desks, living spaces, photos, anything, because they become tickets
and $$... a show, a show of putting your enemy on stage to tarnish
while you need to buy a ticket to get permission to throw the ink at
him. What a mock, an ultimate insult!!!!? Great man!? Great man my
ass. I have decided there and then that becoming a famous person would
be the most shameful thing you could do to yourself on this land. It's
worse than a cunt. It's worse than selling your soul to a devil. You
would be selling your soul for a dollar a bush, cheap, trash cheap.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The so called Nanjing forbidden palace has nothing left. Three
elevated stages which would have been the foundation of the three
great halls. Nothing left on them, not even a stone stool on which the
grand wood beams would have been installed. On each stage there is a
sign w/ words explaining the site's &lt;em&gt;historical significance&lt;/em&gt;. But,
seriously, I couldn't help laughing how BS this entire thing has
become &amp;mdash; this is literally, figuratively an emperor's clothes,
use your imagination that this is the historical site, this is the
greatness you came here to admire, but just a few line of modern
prints are real, everything else, thin air. What is this!? Tourism of
virtual reality? Then why am I here!? I don't know what to make of
this. I can understand some relic sites would have nothing left
physically but a site of ruin. But this one, I don't know, too
virtual, or should I say, unreal, to be called of, anything, but an
emperor's clothes, just like this city, a city of thousands of years of
history, yet it could only produce such a cheap quality relics for its
admirers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Guangzhou&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Guangzhou impressed me. Riding the subway at its rush hours were not
as unpleasant as I would have expected. Though crowded, the cabin was
quiet. Then, sitting in a basement Starbucks felt much like I were in
Japan instead of a part of China &amp;mdash; music was relaxing, not much
shop noise, customers didn't come in w/ an air of brag, no one chatted
in a loud voice. It was a nice break for me after the long trip of
taking care of dad. Finally I could feel my heart was slowing down, my
mind slowing down, and I could breathe.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Walking into the narrow alley behind or between buildings were quite
something. I don't know how people would live there, and how any
public service such as post office, electricity, gas... how the hell
could anyone manage such navigation!! I would be scared to knock on
any door let alone asking for a payment, and do they even have a
meter!? These places are "a riddle wrapped in a mystery inside an
enigma". It felt like those tropical plants that had lived and grown
on that spot over the years that it took over spaces, air, light, full
of life while also full of suffocation. A part of the popular
neighbourhood was under removal order so that many buildings were
vacant, building left with half of itself, exposing entrances without
a door, windows without a window, rooms without furniture or human,
like a corpse cut open w/ its guts all exposed, on a display in a
broad daylight. I think the city could use some cleanup. But then, I
think those, later I learned a word, city village, is the trademark of
this city. I'm not sure the ones I ran into qualifies for this term,
but they were like nothing I had ever seen.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yuexiu park was nice. If Nanjing was a city of mocking, then here I
found dignity. The old city walls, if they were real, are very well
maintained and displayed. The enormous banyan tree w/ its roots biting
into the wall reminds me the scene of Angkor Wat. I admire the wild
lifeness of these tropical plants. They seem to burst open anything
that confines its growth. As a man getting older each day I am jealous
of such display of strength and energy, and even ruthlessness.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Wondering around the city aimlessly. The street foods in a narrow
alley next to a public toilet was just the feel I was seeking
for. Sitting on a stool almost in a half-squat position, I was
surprised to see a window of an apartment upstairs in a building
across the alley filled w/ cute stuff animals. At first glance I
thought it would be a store selling them. Then, I looked at it again
and concluded that it must be a residential unit. So whoever lives
there, in this kinda of a building jungle and wire jungle, kept a
sensitive spot for his/her hobby. It's like seeing a wild flower
blooming while you walk in the middle of a dessert.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Second-hand electronics&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Walking into this, to me a nameless place, where second-hand
electronic products are sold, I didn't expect to see so many small
shops next to each other selling hi-fi speakers. They had racks of
used amplifiers, most of them are not interesting at all, some popular
names like Marantz, Japanese brands, McIntosh, but honestly they
looked rather boring.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The stacks of speakers, however, had no name plates I could identify,
jumped to life when they were turned on. Happened to be walking by a
small shop where one man sitting on the couch facing the speakers (and
for the hell I tried I couldn't tell which set of speakers were on!),
the music of Cain Qing was on. In a rather filthy building of such and
a crappy small shop, the sound of her was memorizing! I couldn't say
it was lovely, and certainly her song was picked, I would guess,
mostly because of the movie, so that sense of following a known
receipe is rather against my preference of the spirit of a 文艺青年
being different and unique. Yet, the voice was beautiful! Whatever the
equipments were being used, the effect was surreal. Maybe the settings
did provide a level of contrast, thus creating a wow effect. The boss
looking man was jogging down a price quote so I would guess a deal was
in the making. Still, I was impressed. I don't know how so many small
shops within such a small area could survive. I suspect even that any
of these shops, if they would turn on their stereo, would produce the
same lovely voice as the one I just heard. So, it felt, just like many
other businesses when a Chinese biz man gets involved, that a luxury,
being it a beautiful woman or a brand name product, now sells, still
with a hefty price tag, but lives in filth as a slave. Is it a good
thing for consumers? I doubt. I don't like visit those expansive
looking stores, but I don't like this settings, either. In both cases,
I feel the seller is taking his products as a cold commercial goods,
no warmth in it, it speaks of money, but has no connection of life. In
contrast, stores in Japan, though selling used products also, made you
feel it's a store who is proud of its products, which in turn creates
the sense of trust that you, once walk out of the door, could still
feel comfortable to come back. I don't know what it is. Maybe there is
a version of human connection there, too, since I saw the potential
buyer was comfortably sitting at the couch sipping teas, chatting and
laughing. But there is always this sense of cunningness in those. I'm
biased, maybe.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Then, the little point-and-shoot digital cameras. Wow, I don't know
how many of them have been revived. By seeing so many shops selling
them I could only conclude there is a real demand for such thing. It
felt similar when I saw the old flip phones were sold at the night
market in Cambodia. But in Cambodia you knew they were buying them
because they couldn't afford better. But here I think they are in
demand because they fit in a life style, or an self-image definition,
among young women I think, somehow. I don't know what it is. In the
world of smart phone I really don't see why a woman is willing to
carry yet another small electronic gadget which, in my opinion,
provided little value in term of photography. Actually I didn't see
many in action at all when I was walking around the city. But I'm sure
these shops have keener sense of what is in demand than I do. Could
someone enlighten me on this topic!?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Cameras. Went to a well-known market, which turned out to be a whole
district spreaded over a few street blocks, of camera gears. Just
about 90% of the second hand camera bodies were Nikon and Canon. Other
brands had little footprint, used Fuji, none, used manual lenses, few,
m43 gears, some but certainly not a mainstream, exotic lenses or
cameras, a few, but was not impressive, brands like Olympus, Lumix,
few. Then, in yet another those massive shopping complex, each tiny
shop has a repair station where one guy, yes always one guy, who might
be owner of it, has all sort of broken wires, parts, what have you, of
camera body and lens, and the guy was busy fixing something. I always
thought repairing a lens is a rare skill. Maybe it is, but here you
found a concentration of such skills, all appeared to know what they
are doing, and his shop is testifying it being true. That is quite
amazing!  How did they learn this, I wonder, youtube!?&lt;/p&gt;</content><category term="thoughts"></category><category term="thoughts"></category></entry><entry><title>QR code</title><link href="https://fengxia41103.github.io/myblog/qr%20code.html" rel="alternate"></link><published>2023-04-10T05:26:00-04:00</published><updated>2023-04-10T05:26:00-04:00</updated><author><name>Feng Xia</name></author><id>tag:fengxia41103.github.io,2023-04-10:/myblog/qr code.html</id><summary type="html">&lt;figure class="col s12"&gt;

getting desperate at that point because the battery is draining fast
now with these downloads and installation attempts. What to do? The
clerks repeated the same feedback, "do you have wechat?".. yes I do,
but then, what to do with wechat? So it's an &lt;em&gt;application&lt;/em&gt; inside
wechat.. but how to install that!? No idea. No help. In the end,
asking my friend in wechat, you use the &lt;em&gt;search&lt;/em&gt; to search for this
app's name... but when searching "China custom", it showed me a whole
bunch of links to articles and announcements!... so finally, the app
is called "china customs", yes, with an "s" in the end.. installed
that, wechat froze for a bit, then showed me a survey form.. ok,
better... then, asking me the contact's name and phone number in
china... didn't I already do this at visa application? I really don't
know how many &lt;strong&gt;visitors&lt;/strong&gt; could answer this without consulting some
other &lt;em&gt;wechat threads&lt;/em&gt;, but you can't! This app is nothing but using
the embedded browser engine in wechat to display a survey, so
switching to other threads will exit this &lt;em&gt;app&lt;/em&gt;, thus making all the
previously filled information, gone!.... is this wonderful!... so I
had to just make up a number, what do u know!?.. see, this is when a
good person turned bad, voluntarily.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So in the end, after all these frustrations, it showed me a QR code,
with timestamp good for 24 hours!? What does that mean? I'm healthy
for the next 24 hours. So I'm supposed to show this code when arriving
China, also, which makes me to think that we need to make this trip
within 24 hours, otherwise I'm not qualified anymore..... wtf!?
.... welcome, my ass. With the information like how I claimed myself
to be, what's the value of this code? Just a barrier, when they say
jump, you can only ask, how high.&lt;/p&gt;</content><category term="thoughts"></category><category term="thoughts"></category></entry><entry><title>Fun in a small life</title><link href="https://fengxia41103.github.io/myblog/fun%20in%20a%20small%20life.html" rel="alternate"></link><published>2023-04-03T05:05:00-04:00</published><updated>2023-04-03T05:05:00-04:00</updated><author><name>Feng Xia</name></author><id>tag:fengxia41103.github.io,2023-04-03:/myblog/fun in a small life.html</id><summary type="html">&lt;figure class="col s12"&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Maybe because it's too early, it took me a while just a moment ago to
remember where we went yesterday! Yea, Yokohama, a place I read so
much about in books, but never thought I would visit it one day. I had
no idea where it is until I looked it up last night, and wow, it's
only 30 minutes train ride from where we are.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yokohama is pretty, really, and the building of Kanagawa University we
walked in was super pretty. If one ever wants to see an upscale
version of Boston, or any ocean harbor city, come here. And, if you
like to watch ladies in suits, well, I guess any train station in
Japan will be fine, but here you get the streamline version because of
the big glass buildings and finance district, smells money, smells
upscale, smells neat, clean, perfection, for their product, their men
and women. Incredible. Maybe I'm a bit obesessed, but they are simply

society is too much of a consumable goods, that one, for being pretty
and eye catching, is taken into this giant machine that will feed on
it till the beauty is there no more. Some lucky ones find a good place
in life so the styles could be maintained (there are many elegant
mid-age that are truly memorizing), but the rest, youth is the one
powerful drug, or the magic wand, that you could get anything you
want, for a short while perhaps, then the body is being spitted out of
this giant machine, like a waste... but how sad that would be if it
were true. Yet, their beauty is so much like the cherries, indeed
beautiful, breath-taking, 浮世.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I thought the Gundam lab would be more impressive than that. The giant
robot was cool to look at, but expectation led Noah to comment that
"it was underwhelming". It's ok. Noah found his interest satisfied
when we hit the rows of those "egg machines" &amp;mdash; like candy
machine, one puts some coins ($3 per pop), rotate a big dial till one
egg shape package drops down, inside you find this cute little lucky
charm. Noah spent a whole hour, and you could tell how excited this
kid was. It was fun, and I have to say these charms are incredibly,
cute. He snuggled a couple right into his backpack before showing me,
the sole sponsor of this project. I knew he was saving those for
himself. See, that's the small fun in a small life, no Gundam, no
saving this planet or mankind, thirty dollars, one hour of time, 9
eggs in the end (and I'm not sure that's the real number, I think
there are more), and he was happy.&lt;/p&gt;</content><category term="thoughts"></category><category term="thoughts"></category></entry><entry><title>Cherry</title><link href="https://fengxia41103.github.io/myblog/cherry.html" rel="alternate"></link><published>2023-04-02T03:51:00-04:00</published><updated>2023-04-02T03:51:00-04:00</updated><author><name>Feng Xia</name></author><id>tag:fengxia41103.github.io,2023-04-02:/myblog/cherry.html</id><summary type="html">&lt;figure class="col s12"&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Second day in Tokyo. Cherry blossom.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It was a genuine surprise that we walked right into this shrine. I
have heard so much of it growing up with the ideology, but seeing it
is, different. Beautiful spring day. Watching the locals coming in
groups, old and young, I could only guess that this is a spring
weekend outing for many, like walking to a park where you would find
the best cherries, nothing special, nothing heavy, nothing sad.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The cherry trees are beautiful. Though I got just as much pedals in
Cary as here, the trees here felt more, aged, fitting for the scene,
fitting for the culture, fitting for the emotion. I don't know why,
but I felt tremendous sadness. Spring breeze came from time to time,
scattering the pedals as a rain. God knows how many phones and cameras
were capturing the moment. People smiled, selfied, what a good life,
but indeed cherry is like life, beautiful in some time, then, blown
away. For the people who died in the war, or any …&lt;/p&gt;</summary><content type="html">&lt;figure class="col s12"&gt;

believing in something so the mind could reconcile, it was noble, and
it was tragedy. Put the ideology aside bah. A person needs something
spiritual, something that is higher than this material world,
something that is only within, that is, perhaps as fragile as these
cherry flowers, but as pretty and memorable as them, too. May the wind
caress your body, soul, be rest in peace, be remembered.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Noah drew a lucky charm following three girls example, and got a 1st
rate. For the first time in this trip, I felt he was connected with
this land. After that he had been drawn to shrines. Watching him is
like time travel, the young me, with futures ahead, and life ahead. I
wish he would be feeling this spiritual side of things, sensitive,
noble, beauty within, and without.&lt;/p&gt;</content><category term="thoughts"></category><category term="thoughts"></category></entry><entry><title>2023 home trip freddie</title><link href="https://fengxia41103.github.io/myblog/2023%20home%20trip%20freddie.html" rel="alternate"></link><published>2023-03-26T17:33:00-04:00</published><updated>2023-03-26T17:33:00-04:00</updated><author><name>Feng Xia</name></author><id>tag:fengxia41103.github.io,2023-03-26:/myblog/2023 home trip freddie.html</id><summary type="html">&lt;figure class="col s12"&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;food&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Mix dry food w/ a bit olive oil in the morning&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Glass jars in the middle drawer next to the frig.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;New in bags in the trash can glider on the left side of the
  dishwasher.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Amount: in general cover the bottom of the small salad bowl.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Main meals: breakfast (7-8am) and dinner (5:30-6pm). Go with your
  own meal schedule would be fine. He will be begging for food as soon
  as you are eating.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Light meals &amp;amp; snacks: lunch, after each potty run, and before
  bed (sometimes I just gave him some milk).&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;He doesn't have regular web food. Once a while I give him cat food
  from Noah's place. That's his special treat.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;I usually give him my plate after I'm done, nothing on it but small
  pieces at most. I feel it's more of a ceremony to him that he is not
  left out of the whole deal. Otherwise, he seems not psychologically
  satisfied.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;He doesn't drink much. A salad bowl w/ fresh water. He likes water
  cold.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;He has no teeth left. So he can't chew.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;He loves bones. But only give him large ones so that he can't
  swallow to choke himself.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;potty&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;schedule&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Every 4-6 hours, ideally.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;| 7:30am | 12pm | 5pm | 10pm |&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Adjust according to your routine. If leaving him home alone, I usually
will shift his runs so that I could give him one just before leaving.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;He usually poops once a day, most likely in the first run or the last
run. &lt;strong&gt;Always&lt;/strong&gt; bring the bags. He does it twice in most cases, so you
need two bags at least. After the first one, he may walk a little bit
before he squats again for his 2nd shot. So be careful where you take
him. I had once he did it when we were crossing zebra line, hahaha,
awkward.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;places&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;He is used to doing it on the sidewalk. So I try to move him at least
away from shop front or crowds. But sometimes he did it right in the
middle of the road (and stopped all traffic!! Imagine!!).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The bushes by the church on Merrit Road (turn left towards Franklins
if taking the west exit) is usually a good bet. The ones before the
municipal parking lot right across street from our building front is
another spot he will hang out and often does it. Other places vary.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Bike racks on the west side of the building.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If walking along Franklins, just about any trash can or parking lot
pole or tree roots get his attention. I haven't yet figured it out
what's so special about them.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;signs&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If in the morning, he would walk briskly once out of the elevator
  towards the side entrance. In this case he would usually do it right
  after getting outside. Sometimes I could move him across the street,
  but that depends.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If he talks eagerly after seeing you coming home, he likely needs a
  pee. Sometimes it's a false alarm, but I have been giving him a walk
  nonetheless since it calms him down, also. Most of the times he is
  quiet, even when having accident.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Watch out his water intake. He usually consumes a salad bowl of
  water per day. If he drinks heavily one day, be ready to have more
  frequent runs.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If he starts agitates instead of lying quietly in one place, he
  needs a run. It's very much like a little kid.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If he gets up in the middle of the night, chances are he is going to
  have an accident.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;accidents&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It's usually when I left him home for 5-6 hours due to my
routine. Places vary. No patterns have been identified. Sometimes I
wonder he was just not happy about the situation. Because of his size
damage is manageable. I put hims bowls now on the rug so that he
doesn't use that area for accidents anymore.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;He never did it in bedroom, nor near food including frig. Furniture
wise the only case was by a chair's foot but never happened there
again. Overall these are rare events.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;allergy/skin&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;His dry skin is a concern. I have no recommendation. Giving him a warm
bath helps to remove most of them. But they reappear.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There are, sometimes, red spots around his peanut and he licks more
than usual of that area. There is a prescription pad one can use to
wipe the area. It helps.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I have some of his allergy pills, too. I have also tried human allergy
pills (half our dose every 24 hr) on him. No visible effect.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;beauty&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Warm towel to clean his face, especially around his eye area.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Warm bath using shower spray and his shampoo monthly would be good
enough. Shampoo needs to be on him for 15 min.  He doesn't like head
wet, but he cooperates well.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I also give his feet and belly a rinse before bed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;workout&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;He doesn't walk far. He could, however, walk to the Bolin Creek Trail,
just at his pace. The trail we went the most often is the
bike/pedistrian trail by the railway track behind the carwash place.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;He gets hot in the sun due to his hair color. You could tell he slows
down and starts looking for shades.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In most cases, a slow walk around the building is sufficient for him.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;odd ends&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;He doesn't like rain or wet ground. When rain he would walk close to
  the building where grounds are dry. You can make him go into the
  rain to do his business, however. Sometimes I would carry him to his
  place. If caught in a rain he manages fine, however. Sometimes he
  would walk as usual right after a rain. So it depends on his mood of
  the day I guess.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;He sings to a high pitch piano sound. So when watching TV or playing
  music, don't be surprised if he suddenly joins.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One of his digits grows upwards. It may cause him some trouble
  walking, I suspect.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There could be small pebble or odds stuck in his paw hairs. So
  please use the finger to feel them and remove if any. It must be
  uncomfortable.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Don'ts&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Walk around any caktus!!&lt;/strong&gt; His nose got pierced once, and his paw
  was pierced by a fallen spike once, too. Poor thing. Both times I
  was able to pull the needle out, but they were close calls. Nowadays
  I either pull him far away from them, or carry him passing the
  bushes so to eliminate possibilities. Mostly I worry the wound will
  be infected.&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The ChatGPT is all over the internet these days. Had a long discussion
yesterday, and it's becoming clearer and clearer to me that this is
nothing but another hype, and I could say this is going to be a short
one, too. NPR's view on this is right on the mark, I think, that
chatgpt is a mirror of our past &amp;mdash; in other words, it is
"perpetuating" what we have said about a thing. In my word, it is a
library or Google on steroid. It does make accessibility to these
&lt;em&gt;text&lt;/em&gt; easier, but it also highlight more and more that the bottleneck
of this entire &lt;strong&gt;knowledge chain&lt;/strong&gt;, which used to be bounded by the
exclusiveness of text books and/or domain knowledge, are now
completely determined by the limited capacity of human brain &amp;mdash;
just like so called drinking from a firehose, or giving someone your
source code.. does it contain all the IPs you want to protect, yes,
very much so, but it's also an illusion that anyone who possess this
code would be …&lt;/p&gt;</summary><content type="html">&lt;figure class="col s12"&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The ChatGPT is all over the internet these days. Had a long discussion

just like so called drinking from a firehose, or giving someone your
source code.. does it contain all the IPs you want to protect, yes,
very much so, but it's also an illusion that anyone who possess this
code would be now on the same footing with you who may have been
working on it for the last 2 months or years. I think the hype around
ChatGPT is yet another case highlighting how easily we are willing to
discard the value of experience (not that I'm now older thus defending
the value of so called "experience", but I have lived through enough
positive &amp;amp; negative cases of this topic so to now understand why it is
valuable and when it is valuable) in face of a shining new kid around
block. while writing this I start to even wonder whether human as a
whole is indeed the "curiosity kills the cat"? I used to think women
in particular are &lt;em&gt;vulnerable&lt;/em&gt; to this trait, but now with the
technology waves come and go in the last few years &amp;mdash; blockchain,
AI, machine learning, now ChatGPT, I deep feel these waves are
arousing the exact same reaction, which then leads me to believe the
same reaction is a built-in character of these human... in other
words, it is not the new &lt;em&gt;drug&lt;/em&gt; is any better or worse than the
previous one, it's that this drug causes the same kind of &lt;em&gt;high&lt;/em&gt;, and
one is relatively quicker to cause the effect than the other, maybe.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So indeed what we are witnessing is not yet another technology which
leads to the future. On the contrary it is a new drug on the market of
which we, the opiate addicts, are now getting high from. Do we really
care which drug to take if they are giving the same sensation in the
end? And further, is then this new drug any &lt;em&gt;better/worse&lt;/em&gt; than the
other one? If looking under this light one would reasonable argue that
there must be certainly a relatively position between the two, or any
two, different offerings, whereas one represents a less risk to human,
whether in the physical sense or spiritual sense, than the other
one. However, this logic only holds when we discuss it within a
boundary, for example, that these drugs don't kill me, or damage me to
a degree is a health hazard. I know the threshold of the &lt;strong&gt;harzard&lt;/strong&gt;
is up to debate. Indeed, where we draw the line as being &lt;em&gt;acceptable&lt;/em&gt;
is the tricky shot, always. So along this line, if the two drugs can
kill me in a equally measure, well, even on this aspect it's difficult
to categorize the two being equal or not &amp;mdash; think of the WWII's
gas chamber in which Nazis created such a &lt;strong&gt;super drug&lt;/strong&gt; which get a
life eliminated in two seconds vs. some other ways described in
classic literature. So it is, in this sense, better, a progress. But
then, isn't it strange if two now develop a discussion that my way is
better in killing than another? If you were given the task to do just
that, yea it makes total sense and very practical and even
necessary. But at the mean time we could present many other aspects of
the same act that not only it's irrelevant one way of killing is
"better", but the whole idea is simply, wrong!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now let's talk about the common &lt;em&gt;scare&lt;/em&gt; that so and so will now
replace your job. Doesn't it sound familiar? Of course. There is
nothing new about such scare, historically or recent. I have had a
bump year in my career, but I failed to see any connection between a
new technology, new programming trend, and my job loss. Actually the
fundamental logic train of such scare is simply wrong. The way it goes
is "If you have skill A, you will have a job; else, you don't."
... but this is a logic fallacy!!! Two problems here. First of all,
skill A is not sufficient. There is logical guarantee at all that
having a skill A will lead to a job. Plenty examples in life regarding
this.  Second, if we temporarily accepting that "A &amp;rarr; B", then
"not A &amp;rarr; not B" will be true, "I don't have a job because I don't
have skill A"... this is even more obvious than the original
form... you could have million reasons not having a job, deficiency in
skill A is just option on a long selection list.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Many posts are titled "ChatGPT will obsolete frontend engineering",
and examples of asking it to write a table, and viola, it gives back a
nicely written React code which works perfectly. Great? Not at all. I
have long argued that Google is as smart as the question you ask. Same
applies here. If I could have broken down a feature in such a
level of detail and described the intended implementation clearly, I
bet I could have found a code snippet by Googling which is equally &lt;em&gt;good&lt;/em&gt; as
the chatgpt feedback. The so called search-engine-oriented programming
is in play here. But, just like the piece you found in Google, you
copy &amp;amp; paste it in to yours, run it, what's the odds it works out of
box? In my experience, minimal!!!! ... just like I always question
someone who pieces a few blog info together in a PPT and claims it
will work because the blog says so!!!... the reality is much harsher
than this. Copy &amp;amp; paste is nearly a given in today's engineering
work. Not many people have the capability to &lt;strong&gt;reinvent the wheels&lt;/strong&gt;,
and not many's job need to. 99% of the people are &lt;strong&gt;integration
engineers&lt;/strong&gt; &amp;mdash; they copy &amp;amp; paste code from here and there, and
glue together in some fashion so that it achieves what s/he wants to
achieve. Think of how many third-party code your project actually
requires! I could safely bet that in any project these days, less than
10% of the final product is &lt;strong&gt;original&lt;/strong&gt;, it can't be higher, and it
needs not be higher. Integration is to say we are standing on shoulder
of the giants, but the standing itself is much much more challenging
than many realize!!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So again, chatgpt's code requires my brain to read, to understand, and
likely to tweak so it will fit into my &lt;em&gt;legacy&lt;/em&gt; code, so the amount of
workload my brain needs to take hasn't changed. Well, asking any
programmer how s/he enjoys reading someone else's code? I mean, how
many people even likes reading an operator manual? These &lt;em&gt;example
code&lt;/em&gt; are exactly that, a manual, that shows you can do this this way,
but it guarantees nothing of its validity, and certainly nothing of
its connection to your code (well, it doesn't know your code, doesn't
it? So as cliche, it doesn't know what it doesn't know)... so these
examples are absolutely nonsense! It equals to you ask a saint "what I
should do next" without having him/her know anything about your
situation... then this person just spills out an answer "go
west"... how credible is that!? You gotta be insane to jump to action
based on that.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In &lt;a href="https://fengxia41103.github.io/myblog/reflection on technology.html"&gt;1&lt;/a&gt;[this blog] I have reflected the value of technology &amp;mdash;
transparency, efficiency, and accountability. I think Google and
ChatGPT has achieved nice progress in the first two categories. But we
haven't done enough in the last one. I fear these tools are making too
great a progress in constructing a positive feedback loop of
information, but little in a negative feedback. And as a common sense
of a positive feedback loop, such system is not stable.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So, what will this society to become!?&lt;/p&gt;</content><category term="thoughts"></category><category term="thoughts"></category></entry><entry><title>What is my value</title><link href="https://fengxia41103.github.io/myblog/what%20is%20my%20value.html" rel="alternate"></link><published>2023-02-26T11:27:00-05:00</published><updated>2023-02-26T11:27:00-05:00</updated><author><name>Feng Xia</name></author><id>tag:fengxia41103.github.io,2023-02-26:/myblog/what is my value.html</id><summary type="html">&lt;figure class="col s12"&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I feel anxious. Worked all day yesterday on the Chinese visa app,
actually made some really good progress &amp;mdash; I can now get data of
an unsubmitted form in JSON, and even parse data out of a generated
PDF! This is pretty wild! I never thought PDF could be parsed like
this &amp;larr; it's a combination of some &lt;em&gt;structured&lt;/em&gt; format of PDF and
some visual cue such as "selecting the ones below this element" which
literally draw a box from this element down, and any &lt;em&gt;element&lt;/em&gt; having
overlap of this &lt;em&gt;visual box&lt;/em&gt; becomes selected! Wild.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But, I feel down today. Running into a neighbour's friend last night
and this morning, the same lady who stopped me some time ago when
there were a homeless w/ some mental issue lingering at the front door
of our building, and apparently he stopped her that night, which
understandably made her extremely nervous when I met her. She talked
and talked, and I was only able to calm her down a bit by rubbing her
back and giving her a few …&lt;/p&gt;</summary><content type="html">&lt;figure class="col s12"&gt;

of our building, and apparently he stopped her that night, which
understandably made her extremely nervous when I met her. She talked
and talked, and I was only able to calm her down a bit by rubbing her
back and giving her a few hugs. Then this time, the dog Maggie's mom
was found on the floor of her apartment, and she called ambulance, and
now Maggie's mom in an intense care and lost all conscience... sad,
just sad. I don't even know their names, but news like this get me
every time. I wonder, maybe deep down I'm feeling the anxiety of time
and change that are so inevitable, that more and more I wish
everything around, everyone around, would remain unchanged,
unaffected, neither going up or going down... but that is not
happening. Instead, faces I know are disappearing, or waning, or
experiencing some hardships, which leads me to feel that the same
hardships are coming closer and closer to myself... I think it's
probably my character, that I don't like the slow process if I could
already see the end of it. Almost like how I was working on this app
yesterday, that I couldn't stop until I flushed out most of my
thoughts, and while doing it, I had to ask myself to stop because I
knew I was already tired and work was slowing down, but still, I
couldn't. So in a sense I felt I was digging a hole for myself to jump
in, an accident I planted seed to happen... and that is a terrible
feeling, of myself.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Even though I like the progress I made, and I know there are good
values of these for the business, but I don't feel a strong sense of
achievement at all. Instead, I felt I was repeating the same &lt;em&gt;tricks&lt;/em&gt;
I have done many times &amp;larr; repeating the same "what I already
know", only yet again jumping through all the hoops, and fell on the
way coming... this is, tiring. I know I could pull through those
&lt;em&gt;unknowns&lt;/em&gt;, but to research, to experiment, to learn, is becoming very
expansive, mentally, to me... I still enjoy figuring things out, but I
dislike it at the same time, and the pull on the disliking end is
becoming stronger and stronger. I guess fundamentally I'm scared.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Laying off was mostly a relief. This makes me planning the trip much
easier. But this also creates a dilemma because now any delay feels to
be my sole responsibility &amp;larr; before this I could have excused
myself by quoting &lt;em&gt;the work&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;em&gt;the company&lt;/em&gt;... anything other than
myself would be at fault... but no more. Now everything is under &lt;em&gt;my
control&lt;/em&gt;, and I feel weak in front of all the todos, and all the
things-not-yet-done. I hate myself being the &lt;em&gt;slacker&lt;/em&gt;, or the coward
who doesn't face these things right on. What should I do? It's easier
to say &lt;em&gt;one needs to reconcile with oneself&lt;/em&gt;, than done.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;2023, so far, is a year of me feeling at a crossroad &amp;mdash; on the
one hand, I know exactly one thing I want to do &amp;mdash; to take care
of dad, and spend some time with mom. Then on the other hand, one
depends on another, and I keep avoiding to look at this dependency
chain and start from the bottom up. Coward. I feel tired, mentally,
very much. The three years of working remote has created me a
preference of being invisible, aloof, alone. This, just like anchors
of life becoming less and less strong, then, with each person in life
fades, whether this person is close to me or not, another line
snapped, and now less and less those anchors are holding myself in the
air, and I'm afraid that one day, when either all the anchors are
broken, or a strong wind comes my way, it would have nothing to hold
me down anymore, and I would be blown away, gone.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Is this depression? Maybe it is. I'm scared, and I don't like myself
being that way.&lt;/p&gt;</content><category term="thoughts"></category><category term="thoughts"></category></entry><entry><title>Job, and Da mama</title><link href="https://fengxia41103.github.io/myblog/2023.html" rel="alternate"></link><published>2023-02-05T17:04:00-05:00</published><updated>2023-02-05T17:04:00-05:00</updated><author><name>Feng Xia</name></author><id>tag:fengxia41103.github.io,2023-02-05:/myblog/2023.html</id><summary type="html">&lt;figure class="col s12"&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Left the company last Friday. The end came rather quickly. It was
announced on Thursday's meeting, then got the call on Friday that the
last day was then. Couldn't really tell I felt. It was expected, and
the timing was rather strange because I was working with an agent on
my Chinese visa so that I could start arrange a trip back home to take
care of dad and mom. So rather feeling shocked or sad, it was a bit of
"now I could plan for the trip without obligation" then. It's ok. I
have seen plenty of such ups and downs, and going on this trip is the
most important thing on my list. Dad passed away last May, and I
haven't been able to get him to our family's resting place due to the
stupid pandemic policy China has been following until recent. What a
shame! So here we go. Now without the job to worry about, I could
really think about what kind of trip I would like to have, and maybe …&lt;/p&gt;</summary><content type="html">&lt;figure class="col s12"&gt;

shame! So here we go. Now without the job to worry about, I could
really think about what kind of trip I would like to have, and maybe
this is a sign by fate, or by dad, that it's time to get mom's rest of
life settled so that she could be safe and sound. Strange, isn't it,
how life and timing work? I don't know. These days I constantly feel
like swimming in an ebbing wave, not much control at all, just being
pushed here and there, and trying hard to peddle, and sometimes
doesn't even know why I still keep head above the water. I already
lost a lot of sense of purpose and interest. Life is not only dull,
but grim. It has little color in it, being both in the photos I take,
and the reality I see. Future isn't better, either. I don't know. It's
a depressing feeling I can't shake off regardless how hard I try. It's
just, there.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Adding to this, is the news that Da mama passed away. Had a chat w/ Da
jia jia. It wasn't really sad, but it was still sad. She got to 101
years old, maybe that's good enough for anybody. Still, it's another
person that I am familiar with, gone, no more, and that acknowledgment
by itself is the root of sadness. Right before this whole Covid chaos
I got to visit her at her nursing home on my 2019 trip. Haven't seen
her for years, and have heard plenty of this legendary nursing place
which Dad had plenty compliments on. Then, I took a great picture of
her, sitting on her wheelchair, smiling, with wrinkled hand, and still
wears her ring. She was cheerful as ever, though she had lost most of
her memories also just like Dad. She could hardly recognize who I am
after an introduction only a minute ago. But she was talkative, and
had a quick wit as she has always had. Dad at the time wasn't doing
well already. So watching her makes me wonder how a person farewell in
a life &amp;mdash; she had plenty hardships in her life, and she kept her
head high; Dad had his share of pain and stress, and he did
alright. Then he quickened the pace and overtook her in this aging
process, and went ahead though he is 15/6 years younger than she
was. How strange life's plan really is! What's the purpose, or the
reason behind all these? What determines a person's time when his/her
time is up? ... in the end, both could now be counted as part of the
Covid statistics, and I bet neither of them had any such plan in
life. What a joke! Dad would have scorned on such idea, and she,
probably would have made some fun of this as her humor always did. But
in a sense they are now meeting again, on the same page, at the same
line, and in the same world.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Farewell, Da mama, and dad. I hope they all like the place there. Now
you could talk to each other again in your Shanghai dialects, and find
each other's thoughts comforting and calming. I will miss you, Da
mama, and I think I already do. Go cheer my dad, and make him laugh
again. Tell him I miss him very very much. If only I could know that
you guys are all doing well and happy there.&lt;/p&gt;</content><category term="thoughts"></category><category term="thoughts"></category></entry><entry><title>Nihilism</title><link href="https://fengxia41103.github.io/myblog/nihilism.html" rel="alternate"></link><published>2022-12-23T10:48:00-05:00</published><updated>2022-12-23T10:48:00-05:00</updated><author><name>Feng Xia</name></author><id>tag:fengxia41103.github.io,2022-12-23:/myblog/nihilism.html</id><summary type="html">&lt;figure class="col s12"&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Nothing is better than hiding in my little dark room and reading a
book w/ a cozy blanket, and that's what happened yesterday. But the
topic is rather a bizzare one, to my regular taste &amp;mdash; information
technology and its effect on politics, in particular, of the future of
democracy. Written in 2014 and added one more chapter at the end in
2018, the book reads like a prophecy w/ hindsight of Trump and
insurrection.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The point is this &amp;mdash; w/ the spread of the mobile and the
Internet, social elite is losing credibility because they lost the
monopoly of information. What used to be a top-down information flow
whereas all walks of experts, authorities were the final saying of
his/her particular field are being toppled because, inevitably,
their sayings are full of loopholes, which have always been there, but
the public has little access to any alternative reference/information
to discover, let alone to challenge. This echoes mine perception,

&lt;p&gt;The point is this &amp;mdash; w/ the spread of the mobile and the

monopoly of information. What used to be a top-down information flow
whereas all walks of experts, authorities were the final saying of
his/her particular field are being toppled because, inevitably,
their sayings are full of loopholes, which have always been there, but
the public has little access to any alternative reference/information
to discover, let alone to challenge. This echoes mine perception,
which I have joked w/ in many occasions, that Noah and his generation
have all the equal advantage of using Google as much as I do,
therefore their access to so called information is on par w/, if not even
superior than, mine. What this leads to is that the traditional
foundation of me being an authority of whatever a topic to him, now he
has vast other channels to either prove or reject my version.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now the curious thing is that. With such a challenger, you would think
the sayer, or those authoritative figures, would be more careful w/
their words, w/ more homework and evidence behind the scene so that
they could sustain such challenge. But this is making an assumption on
the sayer's nature that s/he is a &lt;strong&gt;responsible&lt;/strong&gt; person, meaning that
s/he feels bad, embrassed, if they were challenged and eventually
proved wrong. But apparently such an assumption of human nature is way
too optimistic. Instead, what we witness at the moment of China speaks
loudly of what a person, a group of persons, or an name tag you would
use to describe this lump sum of bodies, heads, the public, the mass,
the people, are capable of speaking, and believing a non-truth, in a
broad daylight, unshamed, unembarassed, and many times eagerly, and
sincerely.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Let's leave that topic for now. What I want to discuss here is another
thread which I found quite interesting &amp;mdash; &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nihilism"&gt;nihilism&lt;/a&gt;. This is about
Noah. Now w/ them having access to what used to be a monopoly of
information, like the &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reformation"&gt;Reformation&lt;/a&gt;, commoners are now in position
to challenge the status quo. But the challenge itself doesn't mean
they are always right. This is why I used the word &lt;em&gt;information&lt;/em&gt;
deliberately above instead of &lt;strong&gt;knowledge&lt;/strong&gt;. I still believe age,
experience and education give a person the edge of translating
information to knowledge. With both of us having the same access to
Google, my knowledge, or should I say my capability to assemble
information, distill and discard bits and pieces, so to supplement my
existing knowledge and/or learning a complete new one, is still
stronger than Noah's. I have no doubt of that. Given another 5-10
years till he reaches post-college, I also have no doubt his
processing capability is going to surpass mine, probably
indefinitely. But again, having a laptop next to a powerful server,
there is nothing logical about the programming running on the laptop
is definitely inferior to a one running on the server &amp;larr; it's the
quality of the software that is more important than the sheer
processing power of the CPU. Likewise, drinking from the same Internet
hose, education, reading, thinking.... all these &lt;strong&gt;soft skills&lt;/strong&gt;
determines the quality of &lt;strong&gt;knowledge&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So, what does this mean? I think there are two aspect of this.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;First of all, with visibility to some of the &lt;em&gt;hidden&lt;/em&gt; information due
to this technology age, more brains are being activated so that more
are indeed in a position to challenge, and this leads to the
&lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nihilism"&gt;nihilism&lt;/a&gt; &amp;larr; a strong motivation to reject what we have today,
but the key feature of &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nihilism"&gt;nihilism&lt;/a&gt; is that it does not provide the
alternative &amp;larr; it is not constructive. Taking it to an extreme, it
is actually destructive, and can even be confused w/ being
revolutionary (but it is not! I'll explain later), because its thrust
is at crossing out the present, and even the past (think of how we get
to the &lt;em&gt;present&lt;/em&gt; if not because of the &lt;strong&gt;past&lt;/strong&gt;!?), but isn't much
interested in analyzing the root cause, thus isn't deep enough to
provide a step forward. This description definitely reminds a young
kid that when the parents are asking "do you want some eggs for
breakfast?" "no" "how about milk?"  "no"... but it's a much harder
question if to ask "so tell me what you'd like to have?"... the barber
I used to go to in east Boston, I remember he quoted his experience
visiting his grand daughter one time, the mom kept asking the 2-year
old what she wanted for breakfast, and he said "that's just crazy!
What does she know about it?".... it sounds very much politically
incorrect these days :) we can't dismiss a two-year old as if s/he
doesn't know, or even think, but we also see that there is a grain of
truth in such a rant. After all, no parent sane enough would listen to
a two-year old for a driving direction, or even give whatever the kid
wants to eat, because all parents know by life experience that the kid
at that age is willing to put anything into his/her mouth w/o a blink.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So here we are, at the early age of information technology, the public
are just like a two-year old. On the one hand we start to get a sense
of this world which were foreign to us without such an
infrastructure. Then on the other hand we are still no in par w/ those
authorities who, like a parent, used to know more, if not know
all. So, naturally we are entering a rebellious phase &amp;larr; sometimes
I wonder, the teenage rebellion is the same symptom of human being
arrogant in face of nature &amp;mdash; we sometimes are firmly believing
in our ability to navigate, to change an existing order, but many
times prematurely, and that leads to this &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nihilism"&gt;nihilism&lt;/a&gt; &amp;mdash; I
don't like what I have, but I fail to answer what I want.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Second, because challengers themselves are often over-estimating their
knowings, I believe there is still room for elites, experts, or anyone
who holds a deeper thought of a topic. In other words, nihilist,
though massive in numbers now, are more likely than not to be only
able to scratch the shallow surface of things, even though s/he may
feel a keen interest in the topic/agenda. To propose an alternative,
or should I say a &lt;strong&gt;good alternative&lt;/strong&gt; other than the status quo,
requires a much harder understanding of the problem, and that learning
experience isn't pleasant at all. In other words, in order to be
constructive, one would have to have intimate knowledge and some
philosophical thinking of the likes &amp;amp; dislikes, and that, like
becoming good at any sports, requires training, self-discipline, and
is an experience mixed of fun &amp;amp; agony. Browsing the Internet makes
casting a net wide easy. But that does not replace you knowing where
to cast the net so you could harvest fish. Not to mention that you, if
taking yourself as now the captain of your own ship, you need to know
your fish's habit, kind, market price, how to preserve them afresh,
navigate the map, battling a tide/storm, managing crew, fixing boat as
you go, and on and on and on.... so, just because I could watch all
the majestic mountain climber youtubes makes me nowhere closer being
able to climb the least challenging hill next door.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now I start to understand why there is a profession called
"professional agitator", those whose career was to start a
revolution. These people are more than a nihilist. Instead, they offer
alternative, and sometimes have a viable way to achieve that, though
their ways is paved w/ blood and death. The saying that &lt;strong&gt;you could draw
the best picture on a piece of blank is nihilism&lt;/strong&gt;; the saying that
&lt;strong&gt;giving God your property and your soul is saved&lt;/strong&gt; is
religion. American politics, as a mirror of its residents' sentiments,
have truthfully reflected the teenage-type nihilism, so that Trump and
the 1/6 flattered themselves being revolutionary, but they were but
nihilists &amp;mdash; they don't like eggs and milk for breakfast, but
that's the end in itself. If not the current system of democracy, or
whatever the name you'd like to use, then what? If not the current
voting process, then what?... alternatives seem abundant, I would say,
China? Cuba? North Korea? Congo? Singapore?.... name one, any, then
make a poll of the American public again, or vote (then ironically
isn't this is the same process we don't like!?), see what's the
choice.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Personally, I don't see an alternative. Not that I like what we
have. I truly believe the current two parties are both, not
inspiring. But they are still better than China's. Zhao said to me
when we were discussing a similar topic on Beijing street one night,
"capitalism isn't the best; it is the least evil". What America has is
indeed the boundary of human's thinking in term of governance. Just
like a boundary in physics, it's not an intrinsic sin being the
boundary. Rather, it's offering itself to be proven wrong. Therefore,
its appearance of being broken or unstable is a given, and in my
opinion, is its strength. Nihilism is actually a cowardice. I don't
advocate struggle in life being a virtue, but I totally dismiss
behaving like a 2-year old saying "no" as the only answer.&lt;/p&gt;</content><category term="thoughts"></category><category term="thoughts"></category></entry><entry><title>white paper</title><link href="https://fengxia41103.github.io/myblog/white%20paper.html" rel="alternate"></link><published>2022-11-28T11:12:00-05:00</published><updated>2022-11-28T11:12:00-05:00</updated><author><name>Feng Xia</name></author><id>tag:fengxia41103.github.io,2022-11-28:/myblog/white paper.html</id><summary type="html">&lt;figure class="col s12"&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The news clip of Shanghai's protest was a surprise when I first saw it

body. For a full day and night I couldn't really dismiss the images

more development becoming available. Sometimes I even felt an urge to

name, a nameless victim.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One couldn't have chosen a better totem than a white paper. It can be
interpreted in so many ways, and is so well echoed w/ the Chinese
culture &amp;amp; history. Easily it's a symbol to protest the censorship that
no criticism is being shutdown w/o mercy and exception. It's also a
history when the Empress Wu put up a tablet for her tomb w/ no words
on it &amp;mdash; I vividly remember the story when data told me of this,
I was just about Noah's age now, that she thought her achievement were
too great for any words to capture, or, wasn't she fear of
controversial postmortem? So this piece of paper also signifies the anger
and emotion the beholders had, which, in many ways are too
overwhelming to be in words.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Or, didn't this party started by preaching that the best picture could
be drawn on a blank page? So they were using this line to justify
their ideology of smashing all the olds to make way for the "new",
which they themselves staged to represent. But of course in the end
the olds were smashed alright, but the &lt;em&gt;new&lt;/em&gt; turned out to be indeed
something new &amp;mdash; some new ways of repeating old crime and new
methods to create old misery. The powerful are still beyond law and
moral, and their biggest interests are to shut off eyes and ears, and
numbing heart and soul. Surely blank paper is a clean start, but
social life has no reset button. I don't know any possibility to
create such a blankness without extincting the life off this piece of
land, or should I say, yes there is such blank paper, so will be the
after effect of its creation &amp;mdash; a lifeless void.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Noah's swimming training is going well. Though the kid struggles from
time to time, he has been in this and didn't skip much. After jumping
in the car reluctantly this morning, he started to talk soon after
seeing the figurine I put on the dashboard, and was in a good spirit
shortly. This, actually is pretty rare, and I felt glad that he is
indeed growing up and being more and more behaving like a, grown up? I
don't know whether I really like to him to grow up already. Sometimes
listening to his audio saved in wechat I missed the little boy I
knew. He is not a little boy anymore, which I'm both grateful and
wishing otherwise. I guess that is the dilemma of a parent, wanting
them to grow up quickly, being happy for each step forward they are
taking, but also want them to stay little because then they would
continue to be attach to you, and need you. Soon he will become
independent more and more, like driving himself to …&lt;/p&gt;</summary><content type="html">&lt;figure class="col s12"&gt;

continue to be attach to you, and need you. Soon he will become
independent more and more, like driving himself to places he wants to
go, and even the role of a driver these days won't be there fore me
anymore. Sitting here at deck and watch him diving into the water is
such a bless, especially after a long week of endless working. I know
sometimes it's tough for him to keep on such routine, but I'm hoping
this will help him to find himself, knowing himself, experiencing some
ups and downs, and in the end becomes a strong person that he could
then enjoy this life with a good health, a good spirit, and a good
heart.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;China's so called big meeting is official over, so is the fate of this
nation. It's disheartening that an entire society could swing back to
its old course so quickly. One would have imagined that the momentum
of the last three decades would be hard to stop. After all, isn't
there such as thing as inertia and old habit die hard? But apparently
not much so. Old habit die hard, indeed. The old backwards thinking of
having a strong man leading to victory hasn't died in the face of
progress. The boom we saw a few years ago was but a small deviation of
course of the old habit. People living in it at the time thought it
would have been that forever, just like people living in those
terrible 10 years would kill themselves because they felt the same
way. I found it curious how easily a person could be &lt;em&gt;influenced&lt;/em&gt; by
these macro environment and in turn lost themselves. For me it was
obvious all along that there had been signs, especially incoherent
signs, that made the story don't add up &amp;mdash; how can a top tier
mall hosting all the world class names having a smelly bathroom? how
can a person in uniform freely stop me walking in subway station for
ID as if he were entitled and I was belittled? how can a business
discuss always ended with "you don't understand China" "we have out
characteristics"? how can elites standing on stage talking about 弯道
超车? how can everyone be millionaire because of real estate as if any
land is now worth a fortune (doesn't the entire Earth is by
definition, a land? then why there is poverty, poor country, poor
people?)... These didn't add up, never did, but people living there,
or I should say, people who were beneficiary of this
made-up-explanation, didn't want to see them. They convinced
themselves, based on their person experience of fortune, that these
incoherence were just imperfections in a world of perfection. Like the
word "chinese characteristics", is a silver bullet to explain
anything. After all, it can't be proven otherwise, true or false.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So in the end, I see this consistency in human nature of
make-to-belief, that a person is always choosing to believe what s/he
wants to believe, and it is completely detached from what the fact
could be. Therefore it becomes important what this person's system of
belief could be. I mean, it's not about what religion he picks up. But
rather, it's about a systematic tendency of what he is &lt;strong&gt;likely&lt;/strong&gt; to
be drawn to, just like someone is drawn to spicy food while others to
dessert. There is certainly a grain of this at birth, but the life
experience, education, and what you see and hear daily, so called
propaganda or brain washing, makes up a large portion of it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Once such tendency is part of you, old habit die hard.&lt;/p&gt;</content><category term="thoughts"></category><category term="thoughts"></category></entry><entry><title>Social invalids, birds</title><link href="https://fengxia41103.github.io/myblog/social%20invalids.html" rel="alternate"></link><published>2022-09-26T09:20:00-04:00</published><updated>2022-09-26T09:20:00-04:00</updated><author><name>Feng Xia</name></author><id>tag:fengxia41103.github.io,2022-09-26:/myblog/social invalids.html</id><summary type="html">&lt;figure class="col s12"&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Morning walk w/ Laifu, and found another small green bird lying on the
sidewalk, the same kind I found the night  before. I couldn't tell
whether it is the same one. At a moment I felt this could be the same
family that one was lost going out and never returned, then the other
flew out here to look for it, then bumped into this glass building and
suffered the same fate... I felt sad. Picking it up and brought it to
the same spot where I left the other one. The one I left was gone,
making wonder whether the cats got the bird, or they picked it up and
brought it back to the sidewalk where I saw it again? Don't know. It's
a warm feeling, however, seeing there are a lot of dry foods for the
cats, and a few containers of different kinds lying around, and a box
of water... some kind person is taking care of these cats. I don't
know where they are hiding. Wherever it may be, let …&lt;/p&gt;</summary><content type="html">&lt;figure class="col s12"&gt;

dry, and cats could live there without hardship.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Saw the same guy lingering around the building under the bus stop
hood. I don't know what is of him. He is not a valid anymore. Morning
temperature is down to the 50s now. He doesn't seem to mind. The lady
I ran into the other night who said this same person was blocking her
from coming into the building and got scared. She was really shaky. I
felt bad for her, too, and I felt bad for this invalid. Doesn't he
have a family? or friends? Police was called the other night by the
lady, so I would have thought he was taken away and put somewhere by
the police. Quite a surprise then seeing him again this morning at the
same spot as if he never left. Maybe police doesn't know what to do
with him, either. What do we do with such invalids then? I mean, as a
society, there is bound to have someone like this, either they lost
mind voluntarily or accidentally, they become the person they are now,
and their body is still going while their mind is completely
gone. What should they be? Makes me think of the experience with Dad
when I first took him to Taikang, also. It was my first time being
with all the dementia patients, men and women, some easy to tell while
some are superficially as normal as you and I. I didn't what to do w/
them, either, and many turned out to be just another living being,
though not as understandable as so called &lt;em&gt;normal&lt;/em&gt; people. But living
up this age it is challenging for me too to call a &lt;em&gt;normal&lt;/em&gt; person
&lt;em&gt;normal&lt;/em&gt; just because s/he is not yet as an invalid. There are plenty
of walking zombies whose mind is not anywhere more healthier or
admirable than these invalids. But no one picks them out. If human
difference is really a difference of opinion, then wouldn't it be
reasonable to take the invalid as just another kind who might be
living in a parallel universe now of which we know nothing about?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I don't know. I feel bad for this guy. He is lost apparently, lost in
this world. Worst of all, he is doomed to be lonely. No one is willing
to talk to him, getting close to him, and even being nice to him. He
is a social outcast in the same sense that some back in the Victorian
age committed a shameful sin. We know those so called sins come and
go, each age following a different set of standard to judge. Yet, for
these invalids, they are just forever gone, crossed out already, and
the world is only waiting for him to perish. Sigh.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The bird lost its way in the glass jungle, and this person lost his
way in this human world. Different being, same fate.

&lt;p&gt;It's a strange feeling that you got a text from a total stranger, and
it turned out we could chat like old friends as if there is indeed a
parallel universe and somehow we connected. She is a very pretty
person, and I sincerely wish she has a beautiful life, also. Maybe one
day we will meet in person, but it indeed feels like a destiny of some
sort.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Taking Noah to his swim meet today. I don't know what happened to the
sweet boy I know. I don't think I am doing a good job now as a dad,
and I don't think she is doing a good job as mom, either. He turned
into a person that is constantly unhappy, and is actively avoiding
me. I don't know what I did that is turning him away. There must be
something. But this feeling is annoying on my part. I hate to show up
at his door only to see him unhappy and unwilling to see me. I wish my

at his door only to see him unhappy and unwilling to see me. I wish my
being there would be viewed as a good thing, not that I get up early
in the morning just to frustrate him. The quirky thing is that he
isn't happy either when being with his mom. So, what is going on? Once
a while we get a nice conversation, usually after his swim training,
as if he has let out all the steams in the training, now could be more
relaxed and have a talk. I cherish those moments. But still, I wish
him happy, w/ or w/o me. If me staying away is the key, then be
it. But so far I think himself is confused, and he doesn't know what
makes him happy at all, so just venting on me as if I were the
fault. Oh well.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Swim meet is a thing of joy. It's like a town party. Even kids are
walking in w/ a lawn chair as if they are going to a picnic. And
watching these little ones kicking and splashing is simply, wonderful!
What a beautiful thing life is! Being young and healthy and full of
energy. Sometimes I feel life is indeed short, that the best years of
your life are only that many, and they just fly by. Then you start the
looooong years of being old, being weak, being not of your top form,
and only watching yourself deteriorating day by day, and what an agony
that is! I know these kids don't know that yet. It is a fate of human
nature that you would realize only when it is there no more. I guess
this also speaks of the theory we learned in finance that a loss hurts
more than a gain does for the joy. So the feeling of a loss is etched
deeper. This also explains that Dad was relating all the unpleasant
memories even then he had lost all the chain of reasoning. So safe to
bet that sweet memories are far and between, if any left in the end,
whereas bitter memories stay. What a pity.&lt;/p&gt;</content><category term="thoughts"></category><category term="thoughts"></category></entry><entry><title>Feeling down</title><link href="https://fengxia41103.github.io/myblog/feeling%20down.html" rel="alternate"></link><published>2022-08-31T21:27:00-04:00</published><updated>2022-08-31T21:27:00-04:00</updated><author><name>Feng Xia</name></author><id>tag:fengxia41103.github.io,2022-08-31:/myblog/feeling down.html</id><summary type="html">&lt;figure class="col s12"&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Haven't written anything for a while. I had moments that I felt I
wanted to say something. But those moments were all moment of sadness
suddenly hitting me &amp;mdash; they made me miss zhuzhu, miss dad, and
started to feel, lonelier and lonelier in this world when all these
lives dear to me are passing away. It felt like cutting strings that
are attaching me to this world, and I'm afraid that when more strings
were cut loose, I may snap one day, because there really isn't much I
couldn't put down anymore. Even Noah is growing up, becoming more and
more independent, and watching him now stepping to high school makes
me both happy and scared &amp;mdash; happy for him becoming himself and a
nice young man, sad for him being the strongest tie to hold me
together is having less and less effect on me, and I could now picture
myself going far far away without fearing too much of him being well,
being taken care of. Maybe taking a trip to Japan and living …&lt;/p&gt;</summary><content type="html">&lt;figure class="col s12"&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Sitting on the balcony this evening. Beautiful sunset. It's like a
human life, too, that there is a moment when the burning orange on the
horizon is so bright, vivid, and heartwarming, then, that perfect
moment lasts for only a few seconds, then the blue sky is like a
person's youth, becoming more and more a contrast to the horizon, as
if the youth is coming back again. Yet, it becomes darker and darker,
turned to a gray, then finally an ink sky... just like my life right
now, standing at horizon of a sunset looking back to my youth, they
seem so near and recent, yes they look beautiful from here, and I miss
those days now, but they are just eclipse of memory, gone into the
vacuum of past, no more, no more.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I miss zhuzhu. Sometimes I could feel his eyes looking at me, and his
body leaning on me, with him gentle snore and a cute face. How
wonderful it was then when this were the days. Wherever you are now,
maybe a parallel universe, maybe another life, take care of
yourself. It has been my tremendous luck being with you for these
years.&lt;/p&gt;</content><category term="thoughts"></category><category term="thoughts"></category></entry><entry><title>Dad</title><link href="https://fengxia41103.github.io/myblog/dad.html" rel="alternate"></link><published>2022-05-15T13:09:00-04:00</published><updated>2022-05-15T13:09:00-04:00</updated><author><name>Feng Xia</name></author><id>tag:fengxia41103.github.io,2022-05-15:/myblog/dad.html</id><summary type="html">&lt;p&gt;This is a month of loss. I should say, this is a year of loss. First,
zhuzhu, then dad.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It has been a week and a day. The last week of his life was rough. I
doubt by his will he would have chosen to live like that. But the sad
thing of a person's end is that the decisions affecting your body and
your pain were made by sometimes strangers. Regardless how your will
has been formulated, in the end, a power outside the ones who care the
most of you takes over, and it is not fun.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;How to think of it then? I felt sad when the night I had to sign off
his life. But I feel the dad I know has been long gone. When I was
holding his hand and watching him eating, I don't recognize him
anymore. It was someone else living in that body, the light in the
eyes were shut, and I wonder, what makes a person, who he is?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It seems to be a convention that the last picture in a memorial
service would always be one when he was already old, and I don't like
this idea at all. Why not putting one of his prime time, when he was
eighteen, young, fresh, lively, sunshine, w/ a smile towards the
future, the life, hopeful, fearless, and all possible? I would like to
when it's my time. I don't want to be remembered as a withering old
guy. If anyone cares to remember me, be it that I'm still young,
strong, on my bike riding around, having my camera, my music, my
smile. I think it would be better.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ray was locked in 41, forever. I felt that the moment dad went, he
actually saw him. The two greeted each other at the threshold. Ray,
just like picking him up from a train station, grabbed his stuff, and
the two chatted, walking along side by side. Where would they go? I
don't know. Maybe another home in that world. Who is there? Maybe just
the two of them, for now. But truthfully, I felt it's nice that way,
that their two paths cross again... how many moments in life would you
have wished that your path and another person's would across one more
time? If this is what happened, then this is quite nice, isn't it?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Living half, maybe more than half now, of the so called life, death,
drifting apart... these have become more and more of a routine instead
of a trauma. I can feel the heart is hardening, there is emotion
still, but less and less there is tears, and the gut wrenching feeling
of the loss. Things happen, people die, everything you hold dear seem
to have an end at some point, and all you can do is to wait till the
moment hits, then, if lucky, you will be there to watch them leave, to
make some tough decisions for them, for their good... at least, it's a
comfort that yours is sincere, and if there were any guilty feelings,
you shoulder them.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I guess that's the best you can do, and the best you should do. See
through a life to its end is hard. Pet, human, family, relative,
stranger... they are all the same. A light is off. You walk slowly to
the door, turn around, look at this room for one more time, take a
breath, gentlly close it behind you.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;data&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The No. 1 challenge of data enterprise faces is not the lack of data,
but also the lack of data. In today's world we have too much
data. However, in face of the richness of these data we still feel
&lt;em&gt;poor&lt;/em&gt; because we &lt;strong&gt;lack quality data&lt;/strong&gt;, and the quality can be viewed
along these three dimensions &amp;mdash; normalization of acquisition,
normalization of the data type/format, and normalization of meaning.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;normalization of data acquisition&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Data are everywhere, and being served by all sorts of APIs and
endpoints. But, each endpoint is different in term of handshake
protocol, authentication &amp;amp; authorization, query syntax,
transportation. RESTful is the go-to &lt;em&gt;choice&lt;/em&gt; these days, GraphQL is
on the rise. Yet, even with these terms as the overall guide,
implementation details of such interface can dramatically skew its
function, and even the look of these APIs, for example, some APIs are
governed by data models and conform with protocol standard while some
are home-grown URL that &lt;em&gt;mimic&lt;/em&gt; the behavior but without
guarantees. APIs today are like computer data bus protocols yesterday
&amp;mdash; luckily for the latter, motherboard manufacturer always have
the say of which protocol it supports, thus all vendors of hardware
that wish to communicate with the computer are driven to converge. But
the Internet has no such power. APIs are developed independently, and
have nearly zero governance of what it should or should not
do. Therefore, integration with a data API is a rather unbalanced
relationship between the data provider and the data consumer.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The fragility of data acquisition is the first obstacle.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;normalization of data type/format&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We live in a world of non-structured data while our vision of data processing
prefers, if not requires, structured data. Data anomaly, outliers, are
the most expansive part of data processing because they are not
included in the design blueprint, thus having a high chance becoming
software bug. Regardless how smart the processing tool is, there will
always be a step in which all data in the pipe start to look
structured and alike. Taking image processing, for example. Regardless
how much two images differ, analysis is relying on a pixel matrix to
feed the data processor, and each pixel is a RGB number &amp;mdash;
a &lt;code&gt;white&lt;/code&gt; pixel will have a value of &lt;code&gt;000&lt;/code&gt;, but its place in the
matrix is never missing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This effort of bringing non-aligned data types, fields, formats
&lt;strong&gt;in-line&lt;/strong&gt; so that they appear to be &lt;strong&gt;uniform&lt;/strong&gt; is an overhead to
data processor and can be costly. Some may argue that technology such
as NoSQL makes this unnecessary. But that is not true. The root of
such overhead is that the programmer must have a &lt;strong&gt;finite number of&lt;/strong&gt;
possibilities that the input can be so that s/he can write sensible
implementation. Asking to handle &lt;em&gt;any&lt;/em&gt; input is out of the
question. Even in NoSQL, returned query will fill missing values with
default or null, but records from the same table share the same data
structure.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This overhead of conditioning data in to structure is the second
obstacle.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;normalization of meaning&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Data itself is dummy unless you know how to read it. It's a myth
people think data equals information, or data equals to fact. Neither
is true. Data is a collection of bits that represent a &lt;strong&gt;meaning&lt;/strong&gt;
within a &lt;strong&gt;context&lt;/strong&gt;. I find it laughable people think AI is the
magician who is going to tell me something of my data which I do not
yet know &amp;larr; assuming AI can do that, how would you know when it
tells something &lt;em&gt;new&lt;/em&gt;? This is the same philosophical question that we
seek truth, but even when truth stands right in front our face, can we
recognize it?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Data processing requires deep insight of the domain from which these
data come from. Normalization of data type and format would help to
clarify definition of the data fields, but it does not yet give the
meaning to its interpretation. In a given industry, the meaning of a
term is fairly clear and mutually understood by participants. At the
same time they form a barriers to &lt;em&gt;outsiders&lt;/em&gt; of that
industry. Therefore, making cross-domain data analysis requires broad
knowledge as if we are teaching the computer to speak different
languages so it speak them &lt;strong&gt;all at once&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This acquisition of domain knowledge is the third obstacle.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;Architecture&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here we limit the discussion to the implementation side of an
architecture. The challenge, IMHO, is the sheer number of technologies
a team/project must be able to assemble together in order to form a
product, which in turn are the hoops one must jump through in order to
troubleshoot a problem. From bottom up, you need to know scripting or
DSL to manage infrastructure resource, SQL or some flavor of it to
manage DB, web framework in a programming language to write
application, a list of third-party libraries to support the function,
another set of tools, and certainly different programming languages
(you can run Javascript for server, but you still have to write CSS
just for the UI), for the UI/frontend, another set to write tests, yet
another set of tools to scan code for venerability, security auditing,
another for packaging and deployment, another for documentation, and
one more for monitoring a running instance.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We do these today, amazingly, end-to-end. Otherwise the product
doesn't function. Yet each part requires learning curve, finding
talent, building experience, and tolerating faults. Literally all
parts of the castle is moving and our job is to keep the castle
stand. Enterprise is assumed to have resources to foot the bill. But
the reality is that the complexity of today's web application,
especially if your team is to build and handle the full stack, is
overwhelming. How to formulate a view that dissects such complexity
into smaller scope so that the problem of each scope is defined well
is the role of architecture.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We can find plenty frameworks, design patterns, best practices, tools,
blogs, products, turn-key solutions. The challenge, like a spoiled
consumer who has limited fund, is to choose which one. All aside,
architecture will be subjective. There is not a one-for-all size, but
we also know it must be done.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Thus, fusing all these different technologies into one *&lt;em&gt;coherent&lt;/em&gt;
view as a solution and be executable by the available resource is the
fourth obstacle.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;resilience&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Resilience requires a yard stick. An example is the Service Level
Agreement (SLA). In the discussion above we have stated the complexity
of a system. Thus where the single point of failure or the weakest
link is becomes difficult to identify. Experience plays a critical
role in this space.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One particular challenge that is often underestimated is how to design
and implement &lt;strong&gt;fire drill&lt;/strong&gt; &amp;mdash; simulation of disaster or event
the system is expected to resist. Common scenarios such as server
crash, disk corruption, component patching and upgrade, failover,
isolation of networking... these risks are real but difficult to
account for. Not to mention error handling in code are growing which
eats up human resource and focus.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Then there is regulation on the data apart of inherent data
integrity. Certain industry and certain type of data may face strict
policy with which resilience is measured not only by the recovery
time, but by accessibility, retention period, encryption, and more.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the end, resilience can only be defined by knowing the product well,
knowing the customer well, knowing the use case well, and knowing the
data well. So if to put all these into one obstacle, I would say it's
the balance between commonality of the functions the product offers to
all data and the uniqueness of function applicable only to some.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;enterprise&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Putting all these into an enterprise environment, there will be other
variables such as networking constraint, on-prem vs. off-prem
vs. hybrid, co-location, AD/LDAP integration. Architecture thus
requires not only satisfaction of the core function, but potential to
be extended and customized. I worked in one company where there was a
whole team of "custom engineering" who retrofit the standard product
case-by-case for customer, then I had another company whose motto was
have "one product for all customer" who only adopted feature if it was
to benefit all its customers. The obstacle in this sense can be to say
"no" to a customer, or to bear a cost.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So in sum, designing and building a resilient data architecture is the
ultimate goal, but there isn't a finish line. Enterprise and startups
face the same set of obstacles. Because of difference in resource they
will have different strength and weakness in the process of
approaching them. With large scale adoption of opensource, their
toolbox are rapidly converging to the same set of tools. What will
make difference, I think, will be more and more by the human
resource.&lt;/p&gt;</content><category term="thoughts"></category><category term="thoughts"></category></entry><entry><title>Noah locker room</title><link href="https://fengxia41103.github.io/myblog/noah%20locker%20room.html" rel="alternate"></link><published>2022-02-11T15:44:00-05:00</published><updated>2022-02-11T15:44:00-05:00</updated><author><name>Feng Xia</name></author><id>tag:fengxia41103.github.io,2022-02-11:/myblog/noah locker room.html</id><summary type="html">&lt;figure class="col s12"&gt;

&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Hi Noah,&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This locker room incident has been on my mind for the last two days. I
don't know what to say, yet I feel I have so much I want to say, ask,
and converse. I called Sharon looking for advice, and she suggested to
write you a letter. I thought it is a good idea. Words are easy to
make, but also easy to forget. By writing them down I would have to
organize my thoughts better, and examine again how the words would
convey. Hopefully this is a better format for us to exchange our
feelings, because I believe we both have a lot on the mind, but
equally poor at expressing them well. So let's try this.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I heard from mom that you are regretting what happened. I am glad to
know that, but deep inside I feel very sad. Both as a parent and as an
adult, I feel we have let you down. I wish we had known earlier of
what was going on between you and other kids …&lt;/p&gt;</summary><content type="html">&lt;figure class="col s12"&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Hi Noah,&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This locker room incident has been on my mind for the last two days. I
don't know what to say, yet I feel I have so much I want to say, ask,
and converse. I called Sharon looking for advice, and she suggested to

feelings, because I believe we both have a lot on the mind, but
equally poor at expressing them well. So let's try this.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I heard from mom that you are regretting what happened. I am glad to
know that, but deep inside I feel very sad. Both as a parent and as an
adult, I feel we have let you down. I wish we had known earlier of
what was going on between you and other kids. Foremost I wish we had
been there to offer a better solution than this one before you drew
the conclusion this is the best option. But we weren't able to help
then. You were hurt, and now we feel the pain also.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I feel sad you went through this alone. I feel sad to see you in a
situation where you don't feel safe. I feel sad none of us was able to
be that person you are willing to go to when you were
stressed. Looking back on the days we were together, I feel I lost you
somewhere along the way. I don't know where, and I don't know
how. It's a sense of failure. But more importantly, it's the sense of
powerlessness, that we didn't know what to do when you, someone we
care and love deeply, needed help. Watching you slipping down a
slope is the most painful experience I could imagine, and it hurts
badly.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I know your mom for 16 years now. I don't recall seeing her in such an
emotional distress before. She is a strong woman, but she is not a
superwoman. Labor of work, our cats, taking care of your daily need,
our Airbnb, she is trying to keep all these balls in the air. It's not
easy.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Over these 16 years, I also don't recall seeing her as happy as when
you were admitted into the YOTA that night. If feeling proud of one's
child is common for all parents, then hers towards you is on a higher
level than many others. If you recall, it was also her who registered
you to these trials over the last three years, and nudged me to take
you there when I was hesitant. If there were one person on this world
who is wholeheartedly cheering for your swimming progress, it is
her. Seeing you losing the seat on YOTA is a devastating blow. I could
only imagine how hard this is on her.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When I went through my photos, I often saw pictures of you since
little. I can't help thinking how much future was lying in front of
this young boy then, and how we have been proud you for all the little
steps you have made. Over this journey, you have fallen miserably in
the past -- bruises, scars, maddening moments, you name it. Yet, you
grew, grew, became stronger and stronger each year. I recall the days
when we could list the first 10 words you knew and the exact next word
coming up to your vocabulary. Now I wouldn't dare to challenge your
knowledge in science, biology, and certainly no match in those games,
youtubes, and God knows what other things your brain has acquired. You
have learned so much, and we love seeing it! One day you would also be
a parent, having your child. Maybe then you would understand how much
we are proud of you and all these, and how much seeing you fall like
hurts.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Remember I said that this is our first time being a parent? Each
passing day, each challenge you faced, was also a new one to us. It's
not easy to drive to YMCA each day considering million other things
have to be taken care of. But both of us enjoyed it, because your
training and your achievement gave the time the best meaning we could
wish for. My best reward was always the trip back after your training.
Seeing you in a good spirit warms my heart. When we learned you have
made new friends on the team, we felt so much relieved because we
worried about this after the school suspension. In my opinion, having
mutual support is the best part of a sports team. Everytime when you
walked out the training with other kids smiling and chatting, I felt
as happy and cheerful as you were. When you went to your coach after
each event during the meet to clasp hand with her and hang out for a
chat, I felt we have found you a group that would take care of you
well and you would be thriving in it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So, picturing all these thrown away is extremely difficult for us at
the moment. Even though we are adults, we don't know what to do
now. We feel the pain, both of yours and of ourselves', but we don't
have a magic pill. You have read coach's email. I think they are
sincere, honest, and will handle this well. I trust in their
experience and judgment. So whatever the consequence they decide, I
would respect.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I also think we the family owe an apology to both the team and kids
involved. For the one you offended, we owe an apology for the
act. Violence is never a good idea. It will only create more
violence. For the other two boys in the locker room, we owe an apology
for having them witnessed such a violence. They were forced into this
situation without a choice. And for your coach and team, we owe an
apology for putting them through this disruption. Mom and I will reach
out to coach for a meeting including you. I think we should do this
face to face. Personally I feel ashamed in front of them. Let's try to
fix this as much as we can as a family together. It's never too late
to recognize our own fault, admit it, and give it a try of fix.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I also encourage you to reach out to your coach and maybe other
kids. They shared the same feeling we have, that we feel sad seeing
you did that, and worried about your well being. If you had something
to say to them, tell them. Maybe like what I'm doing now, put your
thoughts in a letter. You may think that "they must hate me
now". Trust me, they don't hate you. Nobody hates someone who is
sincere and honest even if he had just made a mess. They are probably
as shocked and confused as we are.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ok. Thanks for reading this. I just want you to know our feelings, and
find a way to communicate. I still wish mom and I could be the go-to
person for you when you are in distress. Nothing is worse for us than
seeing you Noah suffers. I hope you will understand this now and put
trust in us next time.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Going through the books I have on the shelf, pulling out some which I
feel could live without, putting on others which I feel they deserve
the elaborated attention being on the fancy shelf... all of sudden,
this idea daunted on me &amp;mdash; why type of books are more long
lasting than others?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Certainly there isn't a single answer. But there is always one one
could have. I like &lt;strong&gt;old books&lt;/strong&gt;. They are not necessarily classics in
any measure, but just having a senior age seems to spell well for me
than the youngs. The youngs usually have a much cleaner, and most of
the time colorful and eye-catching, jacket than the olds. But I found
myself tend to pull them off the shelf less hesitantly than the
olds.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For one, I would admit these old books have probably better collector
value, whether they were good book back when or not. It runs like an
antique &amp;mdash; the older it is, the more $$ in essence it redeems if
ever being traded. These old books, some published before …&lt;/p&gt;</summary><content type="html">&lt;figure class="col s12"&gt;

value, whether they were good book back when or not. It runs like an
antique &amp;mdash; the older it is, the more $$ in essence it redeems if
ever being traded. These old books, some published before the 1900,
are heavier,  poorer in condition &amp;larr; papers turning brown, jacket
loose, some have a falling-apart binding altogether... I read some of
them, and most of the contents are not impressive much, either... but
somehow they hold a charm, a charm I start to wonder what it is
besides its rarity perhaps?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Had a chat with 小舅 this morning, part of the conversation was about
aging. Tie it with this book topic, I think this is the same question
one could also ask about an old person &amp;mdash; what's the charm? No
more look, no more physiques... wealth? nah... knowledge? perhaps not,
either, cause the young folks probably don't care what your so called
knowledge or life experience as you would like them to, just take any
son or daughter for example, otherwise parenting would have been a
super rewarding experience with a permanent fans standing by... but we
all know, instead, you likely have a permanent foes ready to fight as
the slightest criticism... so, what is it then?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I think, for these old books, a big part of their charm lies in the
fact of a God's view &amp;mdash; same as learning a piece of history
(well, indeed many of my books are about history), that you already
know the plot, the movie's end, but you are going through them yet
again, with a satisfaction that you know what is coming, thus feeling
superior... but it is more than that. If history book can be viewed as
a story telling, then there are other books which are purely
interesting because its content has been swiped off the history's
horizon, like the books on the old south, of American communities of
all kinds of (to me) strange religions, beliefs, commune
living... they are like fantastic shows at a market meet, some bizarre
snake woman or oriental tribe man... just an awe effect, a
stimulation... but again, because the length of time in between the
book's birth and my time, I could view it both feeling the excitement
in such adventure, and the security of an untouchable &amp;larr; whether
it was a dangerous journey or a cruel reality, it's a text of life
that echos but forever remote.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Also with aging, many of the sayings back when have been &lt;strong&gt;distilled&lt;/strong&gt;
to the point that they are either still well alive, or dead. Thus,
equipped with what I know today, it becomes much assuring when I
appreciate a view by the author, whereas the newer books bear the risk
that many of their topics are well contemporary and even familiar, but
my mind of their content is just as confusing &amp;mdash; I think in this
sense, I read to seek an answer, an opinion, that would help me to
understand the topic, but new books tend to present yet another view,
thus adding another layer of complexity to the understanding, while
the old books can be read in a black &amp;amp; white scope... isn't this then
lazy on reader's part? or just a deep rooted urge to have an
explanation even though it's rushed and even false? I fear so.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Thus, contemporary topics, before they could themselves turn into
history, carry less weight than the olds. This can be testified
further by all the social media posts one does or receives &amp;rarr; few
survives for more than 24 hours even. These should not be called
"information" at all. They are digital comets, flashing by, and if you
happen to see its return, I doubt you would even recognize it's the
same one! So sadly, many of the technical books fall into this
category, books on a programming language, on a technology, at lease
Reader's Corner carries a section on Math and Physics, I guess these
are more endurable than any of the IT stuff.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So, what is lasting? A novel, a drawing, a story, a journalism of a
visit of a foreign place (if it's more about the feeling of the
author than the actual geo facts).... in the end, it's the human part
of the book, the emotion, the psychology, love, hatred... those, that
are still make the book not only relevant, but good. It's a cliche
that human haven't changed over these thousand of years, what the
Greek felt about love echoes verbatim today. So it is. Readers change,
generation after generation. So are the authors.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you want to leave something behind your life, if you do, avoid
being a commentator of contemporary events, dig deep, find the
feelings, find that human that is not just inside the story, but

&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Warm day, getting to low 60s, and felt rather like Spring if you sit
in the sun, a bit windy from time to time, I guess it's the cold air
and warm air swapping their places. It's nice feeling the warmth,
though it's rather out of season, and most branches are naked, just
the way they should be in Winter.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Reading &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/Wouldnt-Nothin-Journey-Enduring-Editions/dp/0807874108"&gt;this book&lt;/a&gt;, a slow documentary of this rural place in
North Carolina, a book of stories that everyone of them is in their
70s, 80s, or 90s, it's a story book of the past, of a place and time
that have gone by, likely never will return.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I start to feel that everyone's life is actually a mix bag of places,
identities, trades, and not the least, times. In a way, everyone is
misplaced, somehow, into a space and a life that didn't feel s/he
belongs, but then, it went on, went through, became someone's life, or
part of it, and then, a story in a book somewhere, or maybe never be
told …&lt;/p&gt;</summary><content type="html">&lt;figure class="col s12"&gt;

belongs, but then, it went on, went through, became someone's life, or
part of it, and then, a story in a book somewhere, or maybe never be
told, and never to be heard, just came and then gone.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The first time I felt that way was during the gig in China
in 2014. Riding the shuttle bus to 阳泉, I distinctly remember it felt
like throwing myself into a tunnel, a black hole... not that the place
was bad, it was fine, a city setting, though not metropolitan, was
decent and busy... it was the time when I was going through the
breakup of marriage, didn't know what to do about it, so rather, just
put myself into an exile, traveling from US to 北京, then to 太原,
then onto this bus... I felt being placed into a space I never dreamed
of ever possibly be, yet, there I was, so the feeling was both real
and surreal... at the time I thought that was an interesting
sensation, or perhaps should call it an experience, that just served
as a distraction from the problem I was struggling with.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yet, reading this book, I start to see that everyone's life, and I
could bet now on everyone's, anyone's, is just like that &amp;mdash; a
mismatch of time and place, that the person would feel something isn't
right, but can't tell what it is... now I know what it is, it's this
feeling of misplacement, a person who would have lived that way, ended
up having had this way... mismatch? I can't say that no more now. What
happened is real, and that isn't mismatch... we may not want to have
had the thing happen to us the way it was, but it happened, and
whatever the days one had, that's THE version, the only version, there
is. So there isn't a misplacement at all. It's just, destiny, or fate,
or life.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I'm jealous that most of the folks in this book were content about
their days. Some had colorful life, some simple. I think once I hit
their age, I would be content as well. A life is long enough. Though
sometimes it felt short, I doubt I would ever want to be reborn and
relive one life again. We just travel through this mix bags of place,
time, things, people, then, coming out of it, is a life, no more, no
less. It's good enough.&lt;/p&gt;</content><category term="thoughts"></category><category term="thoughts"></category></entry><entry><title>Cliche</title><link href="https://fengxia41103.github.io/myblog/cliche.html" rel="alternate"></link><published>2021-12-04T09:42:00-05:00</published><updated>2021-12-04T09:42:00-05:00</updated><author><name>Feng Xia</name></author><id>tag:fengxia41103.github.io,2021-12-04:/myblog/cliche.html</id><summary type="html">&lt;figure class="col s6"&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Listening to this &lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CFq-cWuEAIU"&gt;video&lt;/a&gt;, an opinion on a not-so-recent event
between China and Japan, again, and this idea came to me &amp;mdash;
cliche. I like many of the talks by this host, but this particular one
sounds, dull, thus, cliche.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As a commentator on news, the value, or the content that we listen to,
is his opinion, which makes me wonder, just how many opinions one can
have? More precisely, how many different ways of thinking, views, that
one person can have on these events? Especially if you are commenting
on a daily basis, I feel it is a stretch on some days, not because he
is not good, but that a person's mind isn't always sharp everyday
&amp;mdash; on a good day, the thought cuts through the news like a knife
over butter; then on other days it felt aimless, and worse, becomes a
cliche.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Any more than just the variation of days, I start to feel more and
more that a person, myself in particular, lives towards a narrow end
of a tube if one …&lt;/p&gt;</summary><content type="html">&lt;figure class="col s6"&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Any more than just the variation of days, I start to feel more and
more that a person, myself in particular, lives towards a narrow end
of a tube if one is not consciously aware of such, or even battle
against such. What I mean by this narrowing tube is that the scope of
thoughts become more and more static, that you have a particular way
of viewing this world, thus your opinion, and that opinion becomes
more and more dull, more and more repetitive &amp;mdash; having a hammer,
you look everything like a nail &amp;larr; another cliche by its own!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is actually alarming. At the beginning I explained it that the
forum is restricted &amp;mdash; for voicing dissent there are only that
many people who are in that, or interested in it. But now I am having
a second thought, that it's not only the number of lecturers is
limiting the variety of opinions, but the opinions themselves are
following a limited set of reasoning &amp;mdash; in other words, even
providing more chef, but they are making the same menu, same dish,
same recipe, same taste.... you can open yet another McDonald's, but
it will be no different from the one right around my corner.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Why?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When speaking of an even between China and Japan, it's always the
quote of Japan never officially apologized for its sin and crime in
the World War II to China, thus itself becomes an original sin, like a
inferior birth, a skin color, that one would be forever doomed
regardlessly, unconditionally, and involuntarily... Further, one can
continue the exercise that China has done many wrongs, yet he didn't
apologize to its victims, either, thus the two are just equally evil,
or unfair &amp;lrarr; this, then, creates a downward spiral that the two
race towards the bottom, nothing else, we compete to win a contest
whose hand is dirtier, but what a pointless race that will be!... If
civilization, regardless its precise definition, is generally accepted
as a upward trend that human lifts itself out of barbarity, then such,
or any, downward spin is the wrong direction to take. Period.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Then, these criticisms will also quote that Japan lost the war, and
&lt;em&gt;we&lt;/em&gt; won, and the identify of the &lt;em&gt;we&lt;/em&gt; is another cliche to dispute
&amp;larr; what are, "we"?... And keep going, cliche brings the
expectation of winner being generous and loser being gracious, or
grateful for winner's generosity, and so on and on.... it is a cliche,
isn't it?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But if you really set to look at any of these reasoning, none is valid
automatically, isn't it? &amp;larr; too many times they are being thrown
into discussion or party talk as if they were the First Cause, the
very first domino of reasoning that requires &lt;strong&gt;no proof&lt;/strong&gt;, but they
are not, and even the First Cause itself is not.... therefore, there
are many loopholes, eg. who says winner should be generous?  &amp;mdash;
the best explanation I can think of is that it's a moral code we hold
with pride, or a self-image one would like to project so to be
perceived as such a person. But all these are as subjective as a
religion &amp;mdash; just because you hold a belief the earth is flat, or
round, leads to no reasoning that another person, your peer or foe,
should also share that view, and vice versa.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Even putting these loopholes aside, by listening to one person's talk
for a while, you start to sense the shape of his hammer. I'm not
criticizing at all. Rather, I think it's a built-in limitation of
everybody, philosophers included. The wise have a wider scope, like a
department store, while myself is like a corner 711, then there are
others like a hawker on the street selling a single dish.... this
picture is actually quite accurately echoing the reality of life
itself, that different people having different capacity, luck, career,
success failure, status... the same diversity applies to mind as well,
and just as widely dispersed across a spectrum as fortune and fame.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So, if we say some 80% of the total wealth is being held within the
hands of a some 1% population, I suspect the same ratio applies to the
scope of the mind and opinions. But this doesn't mean an elite
society, because there is a fundamental difference between monetary
wealth and the scope of a mind &amp;mdash; money is singular, meaning
money carries a singular meaning whether it's RMB, $, but the scope of
a mind is not. More precisely speaking, for money, the more of the
same thing, the merrier, being repetitive is actually, the sublime
success, whereas for scope of a mine, the more of different things,
the better, being repetitive is the sublime failure. Therefore, you
see, there are two opposite force pulling everyone of us, and the
society, the world in general, that one force of repetition, that
brings comfort of life, and one against it, brings life of the
mind. So one could say that there is a risk one exchanges the life of
mind for comfort, and the temptation is real and strong.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Therefore, not only we have to allow more different voices to be
heard, but we have to actively seek out for more variety of opinions
so to disturb the scope of mind you already have. If only so could
one, if not resisting the erosion of comfort onto the mind, at least
making it a moving target, so that the mind continues on a run, it may
be on an exile, but it's still better than being stale.&lt;/p&gt;</content><category term="thoughts"></category><category term="thoughts"></category></entry><entry><title>2021 Thanksgiving</title><link href="https://fengxia41103.github.io/myblog/2021%20thanksgiving.html" rel="alternate"></link><published>2021-11-25T21:17:00-05:00</published><updated>2021-11-25T21:17:00-05:00</updated><author><name>Feng Xia</name></author><id>tag:fengxia41103.github.io,2021-11-25:/myblog/2021 thanksgiving.html</id><summary type="html">&lt;figure class="col s12"&gt;

&lt;p&gt;What a surprise! Went to have dinner w/ Noah together yesterday. A
cold winter day. And he went to Publix by himself, and got me a bag of
chocolate!!!!! Oh mine mine mine!!!! This is the very first gift I
ever received from him, all by himself, without me ever saying a word
about it, reminding him of anything, or even thinking about it!!!
Indeed he is growing up now. Soon I guess he will leave the nest and
fly away to find his own path. I'm gonna miss him. I know that
already. Yet, it's a happy moment if that comes, I think, that seeing
him growing into a big guy, and a kind heart, is the best prize I
could ever hope for in this life. Sometimes I wonder, that what is the
meaning of my life? After 2006 I knew I have a big role to play in
this family. Yet I tried, but I don't think I did a good job. I wish I
could be wiser, more patient, more tolerant …&lt;/p&gt;</summary><content type="html">&lt;figure class="col s12"&gt;

this family. Yet I tried, but I don't think I did a good job. I wish I
could be wiser, more patient, more tolerant, more of everything. But
it's the inevitable shortcoming, I suppose, that I need these hiccups
and failures to grow. People around me paid price, bore the
burden. But one thing I could say to myself, is that I never did a
thing with intention to harm, especially if it were for my own's
benefit. All the blunders I caused, though can't be excused as
accident, was sincere mistake. I wish Noah would be a wiser guy than I
was. Not only then he would be a better person, but a happier person,
with less regret. I don't think regret is a terrible thing, actually,
because one only regrets things that are dear to him/her, which speaks
that s/he cared, felt, and touched the heart. I think it's better to
regret, so to feel the pain, and the joy, too, even though things
didn't work out the way you wished, but the feeling of it, the soul
touching moment, the memory you may still have, are worth the
agony... after all, walking through this life, you live only once,
nothing really matters towards the end, only the soul, the mind, the
heart, and hopefully, by then, also tears.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Reorganizing the online album, flipped through some built over the last four
five years. I'm quite impressed by how many I have done! The two
albums are still wonderful. Four years, two years, felt like a moment
just passed by... how funny, but also, how terribly sad... it has been
a while... I don't feel it anymore. Guess if living without a person
to miss, time doesn't really matter, it stops, you move along day by
day, older and older, but the best of you were frozen in time, doesn't
walk with you anymore... it just stood there, where you were... More
and more, I start to feel this life is not real, more and more I feel
the walking me isn't me anymore... it's like me watching a stranger's
life, I'm just watching, feeling something, but not much, as if his
isn't relevant much to myself... why so? Is this the feeling of losing
control? but, what is control then? and did I ever have it?... I
doubt. This is a feeling of disengagement, disengaging from this life,
from everything around, everybody around... it isn't a hermit, just
lost interest in these things, not even much of self, just lost
interest... there are still joy, music, laugh, topics I think,
discussion I do, talks I listen, moments I like... but overall, it's
cold, cold inside... all the efforts are to keep the candle burning,
but it's flicking, flicking, flicking, not much there.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A beautiful weather today. Walked w/ doggie in downtown Chapel
Hill. Quiet. Warm sun. A few pedestrians here and there. A couple
joints were open. Few cars... felt like walking into a movie in which
the town was deserted... and there was no zombies, no disasters
coming... just the two of us, walking slowly... he sniffed around, but
didn't pick up any food from the ground, to my surprise... I guess he
felt the same relaxing atmosphere as I did. No store. No shop. Just a
winter day.&lt;/p&gt;</content><category term="thoughts"></category><category term="thoughts"></category></entry><entry><title>Speak up</title><link href="https://fengxia41103.github.io/myblog/speak%20up.html" rel="alternate"></link><published>2021-11-06T20:17:00-04:00</published><updated>2021-11-06T20:17:00-04:00</updated><author><name>Feng Xia</name></author><id>tag:fengxia41103.github.io,2021-11-06:/myblog/speak up.html</id><summary type="html">&lt;figure class="col s12"&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It has been a while since last update. Thoughts come and go. Sometimes
they appeared suddenly, like a light, but I was always in the middle
of something, I suppose, so they just eluded me. How sad... the funny
thing is, the older I become, the more fearful I become if ideas and
thoughts don't come to me. Especially, when chatting with friends, I
started to see myself repeating the same idea and way of speaking over
and over... such a, &lt;em&gt;stable version&lt;/em&gt;, is both a product of some
offline thinking regarding the topic, and a sign that my opinions are
becoming fixed. At this age I do think having a fixed opinion on many
things is both a good thing and a natural outcome &amp;mdash; after these
many years of living and working and life experience, I doubt I could
be shocked or surprised by much anymore. Everything is like a routine,
and everything and everyone look pretty much the same, mean the same,
to me. I hardly even find myself laugh much these days …&lt;/p&gt;</summary><content type="html">&lt;figure class="col s12"&gt;

and everything and everyone look pretty much the same, mean the same,
to me. I hardly even find myself laugh much these days anymore. It
feels like a cloud over the heart, that blocks the sun from peeking
through. Once a while, the light rays come out. But those moments are
rare, and don't last long, either. Anyway.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I'm here to talk about a moment in this &lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QydOhkfT4Jc"&gt;movie&lt;/a&gt;, a well known one I
have watched many many times since childhood, and was &lt;strong&gt;impressed&lt;/strong&gt; by
what I read from it this time &amp;mdash; indeed, life experience is
giving me a sharper ear and a sharper eye now than before, that I
picked up something I never realized before!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So here is the scene. In the first encounter w/ Japanese navy, the
main character's boat ran out of ammunition. The sailor, who was
portraited as a hero, was frustrated to the point that he was
speechless. Then, the main character, the captain, came down from his
post, asking, "Why did you stop shooting?"... silence.. "Why?"... the
two looked at each other, as if speaking through the eyes... "It
is...", not finishing the line, the sailor choked, supposedly from his
extreme frustration over this eluding opportunity to hit enemy.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But here is what I dislike &amp;mdash; this type of interaction, the so
called &lt;strong&gt;please guess my mind&lt;/strong&gt; way of communication, is absolutely
BS, unproductive, and hurtful! For God sake, this is in a battle
field, and being able to get information passed on clearly and
efficiently is as critical as it gets. Yet, the sailor had to speak
&lt;strong&gt;nothing&lt;/strong&gt;, and let the captain come to the spot, asking "why", and
still don't get a straight answer until a couple tries!!! This is
ridiculous! But very Chinese! I have related another one in &lt;a href="https://fengxia41103.github.io/myblog/irresponsible response.html"&gt;this
blog&lt;/a&gt;. Both are examples of what I call the &lt;strong&gt;corruption of the
Chinese language&lt;/strong&gt;. I don't know why and what is going on w/ these
people, or the script writer, who value such way of talking over
speaking up directly, and honestly. But I can be sure, this is exact
the root of the problem of all the misfortunes people over there are
experiencing, fighting over, and suffering from. No exception!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Without giving out a straight answer seems an art of talking. But I
would say, NO!! This isn't art! This is nothing but being cunning,
irresponsible, and giving yourself an excuse not to think of the topic
much. In the end, you are dodging to have an opinion on the subject,
which, even though having an opinion always sound arrogant, arbitrary,
your-words-against-mine, but I still believe there isn't an
alternative to this. Call this the curse of human being &amp;mdash; you
must have an opinion, whether you speak up or not. Since you do, I
think it's better to speak up, speak out, speak straight... The sailor
should have shouted, "Sir, we run out of ammunition now! What should
we do?"... and by saving the captain from climbing down to get this
info in order to make a decision, the whole boat could have been more
efficiently run, and who knows, maybe it could have indeed won that
battle, as so many had wished.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But this lesson is still not learned. And everywhere you turn there,
you see the same pattern over and over and over &amp;mdash; guess my mind,
guess my intention, guess my command.... everyone is reading of
everyone's mind, yet, no Yuri has been identified. So the entire
matter, be it a country, a school, an individual, is turned into a
giant riddle, whereas everyone is making it more and more difficult
with each speaking chance.&lt;/p&gt;</content><category term="thoughts"></category><category term="thoughts"></category></entry><entry><title>Laugh is who you are</title><link href="https://fengxia41103.github.io/myblog/laugh.html" rel="alternate"></link><published>2021-10-11T22:07:00-04:00</published><updated>2021-10-11T22:07:00-04:00</updated><author><name>Feng Xia</name></author><id>tag:fengxia41103.github.io,2021-10-11:/myblog/laugh.html</id><summary type="html">&lt;figure class="col s12"&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I must have listened to &lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bS0ER79x9AI"&gt;this&lt;/a&gt; before, maybe years ago. I don't
remember much, but it wasn't unpleasant.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But not this time.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After talking about &lt;a href="https://fengxia41103.github.io/myblog/china nationalism.html"&gt;China's nationalism&lt;/a&gt; on the rise, it has
picked up pace and become an avalanche. The most recent episode is the
launch of &lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KCDu88kE5Wk"&gt;this movie&lt;/a&gt;, Chosin Reservoir. I haven't watched this,
but it is nothing but a propaganda. Let's just leave it at that.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This &lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bS0ER79x9AI"&gt;talk&lt;/a&gt;, however, really disturbed me. Not that its content is
truthful or not. It's the audience. In particular, it's when and at
what they laughed. I never realized how revealing watching someone's
laugh could be. But this is a lesson I should have learned early in
life, but now isn't too late, either.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When the talk spoke there were two options for the Russian ambition to
acquire a usable harbor &amp;mdash; one in China, and another in Korea, he
paraphrased a line by the China's ambassador to Russian back then as a

&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I must have listened to &lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bS0ER79x9AI"&gt;this&lt;/a&gt; before, maybe years ago. I don't
remember much, but it wasn't unpleasant.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But not this time.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After talking about &lt;a href="https://fengxia41103.github.io/myblog/china nationalism.html"&gt;China's nationalism&lt;/a&gt; on the rise, it has
picked up pace and become an avalanche. The most recent episode is the
launch of &lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KCDu88kE5Wk"&gt;this movie&lt;/a&gt;, Chosin Reservoir. I haven't watched this,
but it is nothing but a propaganda. Let's just leave it at that.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This &lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bS0ER79x9AI"&gt;talk&lt;/a&gt;, however, really disturbed me. Not that its content is
truthful or not. It's the audience. In particular, it's when and at
what they laughed. I never realized how revealing watching someone's
laugh could be. But this is a lesson I should have learned early in
life, but now isn't too late, either.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When the talk spoke there were two options for the Russian ambition to
acquire a usable harbor &amp;mdash; one in China, and another in Korea, he
paraphrased a line by the China's ambassador to Russian back then as a
proof that China also saw the issue clearly &amp;mdash; "Well, since there
are two options here, if you can't get mine (the Chinese), why not
consider the Korea's?"&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What a smart line! But then, the audiences laughed....... this, make
my heart ache. What a shameful moment it is! Yes. It is absolutely
shameful to think this line smart, even entertaining, and it was
absolutely shameful for such a proposal offering someone else's
property for yours because you were then getting robbed. Shame, total,
shame.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Then, it is a shame, on all the audiences who were excited by this
line, thought this a smart idea, and laughed &amp;mdash; even if they did
burst in laugh at the beginning, I wished they would then feel a chill
on their back right after, because what they just did is exactly what
all the shameful moments in history had been &amp;mdash; when oneself is
threatened, it seems a super common strategy to shake off the threat
is to offer the guy next door for the sacrifice. I heard the Inca
sacrificed human. I wonder whether, then, neighbors turned onto each
other.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But I do have heard that people did that, when in East Germany, when
in the Cultural Revolution, when in the concentration camp.... if
self-preservation is the ultimate survival instinct, is there a line
one should not even cross even in the direst situation?... I
doubt. But then, I still believe such an act deserves a guilty
feeling, deserves a regret, and deserves an agony of conscience, if it
had happened.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yet, indeed many laughed. Chilling, isn't it? Think of what one would
find funny, you see the true inner side of this person. There is a
saying that the core of a comedy is tragedy. This is very true &amp;mdash;
when we laughed the proposal to swap Korean in the rape, it's
certainly a tragedy for Korea. But don't you see this is also a
tragedy for ourselves!? It is not only a tragedy, it is also sick.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So, during our youth we all learned that China had reputation of being
the sick man of Asia in the 19th and early 20th century. Now, I have
to say, its mind, and heart, still are. Total shame.&lt;/p&gt;</content><category term="thoughts"></category><category term="thoughts"></category></entry><entry><title>Witness of an Age</title><link href="https://fengxia41103.github.io/myblog/witness.html" rel="alternate"></link><published>2021-09-16T16:20:00-04:00</published><updated>2021-09-16T16:20:00-04:00</updated><author><name>Feng Xia</name></author><id>tag:fengxia41103.github.io,2021-09-16:/myblog/witness.html</id><summary type="html">&lt;figure class="col s12"&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This has been lingering in my mind recently. I don't know how to put
it. Reading the book &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/Making-Tomorrow-Raoul-Roussy-Sales/dp/B00005WC9T"&gt;The Making of Tomorrow&lt;/a&gt; kicked off the train
of thought that the root cause of this thinking is the idea of

but the ultimate phase of a collectivism.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I have long been surprised, first to myself, then by others since I
learned the idea, that the so called state, or a nation, or one's home
country, the one that everyone seems to hold so dear that it is often
analogized to one's mom, a figure which is highly sacred, in theory at
least, that &lt;strong&gt;demands&lt;/strong&gt; one's love, one's devotion, dedication,
gratitude, as if the attitude towards it/her defines who you are, is
actually quite a recent thing! In other words, I have never given too
much thought where this sacred figure came from. Taking it for

education, nationality, background, family, and so on, are &lt;em&gt;born&lt;/em&gt; to
consider myself being part of this body, this thing called &lt;em&gt;my home
country&lt;/em&gt;, if not because of any particularly external advocate through
school or others, it is self-evident by you being one's &lt;strong&gt;citizen&lt;/strong&gt;, a
legal stamp of your membership.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But, what is it? I'm not here to talk about &lt;a href="https://fengxia41103.github.io/myblog/capitol riot.html"&gt;citizenship vs. the
people&lt;/a&gt; abuse. Rather, it's the patriotism, the wonderful ideal of
devoting oneself to his/her country's sake (usually in the name of
defense its well-being, well, this word &lt;em&gt;well-being&lt;/em&gt; is the tricky
part, isn't it? How do you define that?), whose foundation is the idea
of a country, a nation, or a state. Reading the &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/On_Liberty"&gt;On Liberty&lt;/a&gt; and a
few others, the fundamental discussion if the line drawn between the
rights of an individual and the rights of his/her community. Exactly
because there is such a group, an individual is now always on defense
to &lt;strong&gt;its erosion that he exchanges too much of him own for too
little&lt;/strong&gt;. But why so?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If taking this conflict as an abstract question, it's easy to see
quite a few loop holes in this challenge. Let me list them:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;If an individual doesn't have any right to begin with, then there
   isn't such a struggle of exchanging them for something, isn't it!?
   For example, slavery. One solution.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Vice versa, if the state is deemed having no right to begin with,
   it is not in position to trade, either. For example, the western
   mountaineers who give no damn of any authority because they simply
   don't need anything in return.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Now, if the trade is inevitable and possible, being that both case
   1 &amp;amp; 2 are not impossible, then a trade is a trade, meaning it
   follows the dynamics of any other kind of trades &amp;mdash; both bring
   something to the table which the other party likes to have, but a
   power struggle is always the true drive that whoever is in the
   &lt;strong&gt;more powerful&lt;/strong&gt; position is to benefit more.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So now, moving these three into the sphere of an individual vs. a
State, we could go to case 1 or 2, but highly unlikely these days. The
&lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/Making-Tomorrow-Raoul-Roussy-Sales/dp/B00005WC9T"&gt;book&lt;/a&gt; actually contributed this to the form of production we are
using these days, that the mass production and mass collaboration make
your life without the support of a massive supply chain, which
essentially is the other name of your State, is impossible. I won't
survive a week, or even a day, if I were &lt;strong&gt;unplugged&lt;/strong&gt; from my
environment. Period. Where do you get food, water, gas, heat, clothes,
shoes, shelter? Just strip yourself and go into any nearby woods for a
week, see if you will come out alive. I bet you won't. Therefore, such
production form requires collaboration, which in turn can only happen
when &lt;strong&gt;N persons are organized into a group&lt;/strong&gt;. The more advanced the
product is, the bigger the group becomes. If you look around, you will
see that the so called advanced society, or progress, or development,
or civilization, its trademark is its growing size of group! This
isn't even a population topic. This is sheer driven by the production
need, thus what used to a family surviving on his own land, then
became a village/tribe huddling together, maybe even w/ walls now, to
then a town, then a state, then a country, and recent years a global
economy &amp;rarr; you see, the trend is clear, the size is growing larger
and larger, the dependency becomes not only necessary, but stronger,
remoter (from yourself), and there is not sign it will abate, yet.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Therefore, now looking at the trade we are to do &amp;mdash; on one side,
is yourself, a person; on the other, a blob, God knows how many people
there, called a State, or maybe one day called Earth vs. Star 908
&amp;mdash; the key is: &lt;strong&gt;the power is extremely unbalanced&lt;/strong&gt;. By sheer
number, you are outnumbered a few millions to one in any case. By
resource? forget it, you are a cave man waving a rock while the other
party pulls out a gun, and you also know he wants your stuff... How
awkward, or even, pathetic, you should feel if this is a real trade!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And this is exactly the trade everyone of us is entering, upon
birth. Since the founding of the US, at least we have one case, in
which the small guy is bold enough to claim, that your gun can't just
overpower my rock without damaging your conscience &amp;larr; &lt;strong&gt;call this
a bluff&lt;/strong&gt;! But this is the one bluff we have, and takes courage to do
that! Seriously. What alternative do you have besides such a bluff!?
Pray for the other guy to not use the gun? Well, it seems that both
are appealing the same assumption, or should we say, hope, that the
other guy has some restriction, whether it's a conscience, or one
thread of goodwill, or his fear of his mom, whatever, there is
something in him that we can appeal to so that the trade isn't based
on gun vs. rock, but on the value of the goods, thus a &lt;em&gt;fair deal&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But, honestly, we don't know. Bluffing is probably the first move, but
also the only move. For all the small guys, upholding this bluff is
the only choice, no other! Some are so stupid that why not join the
big guy? Well, remember, this is the trade you can't switch side. This
is the same scenario that had been played out over and over and over
and over. If the big guy's determination is to get you, well, by being
a Jew and a Jew collaborator to the Nazi's will not gain you freedom, or
life, at all. The trade is not going to happen. The robbery is to
happen. It is just delayed when you cave in.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Therefore, it's painful to me to witness China's nationalism on the
rise these years. I think the people should be proud. Yes they have
achieved a lot. But, like a humble guy rising quickly to fame, without
having a good mind, he is lost in the sudden fortune and all the
flashlights. Not only he thinks he is indeed a genius deserve the
fortune, but he now looks down on everyone as if they were downright
lazy and stupid &amp;larr; this, is not pride. This, &lt;strong&gt;is
arrogance&lt;/strong&gt;, and a large chunk of the heads over there are displaying,
and many are firmly believing in, such arrogance.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What creates arrogance? Ignorance. But, how to define this? Even if it
were defined, how to, remove it? I have no idea. Education? Nah, it's
just yet another word, a creed, a magic bullet that means nothing,
having the same emptiness as the word ignorance. So, it seems to me,
it's doomed, the fate of the world, and the fate of the country, and,
the fate of its members &amp;mdash; when one party is believing nothing
but fist, a fist is the only signal his brain can process. I'm not
advocating a war between China and anyone. But I do want to point out,
that the mindset, or the world view, is such that:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;There is always us vs. them. If you are not one of us, you must be
   one of them.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;You either kowtow to me, or I kowtow to you. No 3rd state exists
   (how about sitting together to have tea!?).&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As long as the mindset is so, I don't see any possibility to make a
conversation. But the sad thing is, while Chinese crowd is so
motivated by &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Patriotism"&gt;patriotism&lt;/a&gt;, they are willingly giving up the bluff, the
bluff I have stated above, which is the only saving grace an
individual can have to counter the State. In other words, if the
little guy's defense is his bluff, the big guy, instead of waving his
gun outright, suddenly pulls out a shining stone and say, "Look my
friend! Isn't this beautiful? It's yours now!".... too good to be
true, right? This is the same thing that the Monkey king was put on
his headband, quite a good looking thing, until you put it on and the
code is in someone else's hand.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And this, is exactly I'm witnessing &amp;mdash; the shining thing is
called &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Patriotism"&gt;patriotism&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nationalism"&gt;nationalism&lt;/a&gt;, whatever the name it is, the
effect is the same, too many Monkey kings are now blinded by it,
eagerly putting it on, calling of his/her bluff.... oh people, it is
coming, trust me, if the guy entices you w/ this, he is to recite that
code next, you don't need to guess, it's not part of the plan, it is
THE plan. And just like Monkey King's headband also, once you put it
on, you can't remove it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Sad, frustrated, and pure, utter, stupidity.&lt;/p&gt;</content><category term="thoughts"></category><category term="thoughts"></category></entry><entry><title>Pig teammate</title><link href="https://fengxia41103.github.io/myblog/pig%20teammate.html" rel="alternate"></link><published>2021-08-05T21:39:00-04:00</published><updated>2021-08-05T21:39:00-04:00</updated><author><name>Feng Xia</name></author><id>tag:fengxia41103.github.io,2021-08-05:/myblog/pig teammate.html</id><summary type="html">&lt;figure class="col s12"&gt;

&lt;p&gt;My friend's recent experience with her pig teammates were both
disheartening and sad. So she has been working on renew the lease for
her kindergarten for over half year now. The lease runs out on
7/31. Without it, the whole business would have to fold. Then, among
the four partners, the woman who is also the 法人 of the business,
made up all kinds of shits not to sign this paper by herself. But hey,
it isn't an option even, because the landlord insisted 法人 being the
only acceptable party for this. So in the end, just &lt;strong&gt;one day before
the deadline&lt;/strong&gt;, the four partners got together for a talk (and even
for this the woman resisted to the last minute, of course, excuses are
cheap and also abundant). After hours of agony, the four signed a new
agreement, included all the lines this woman &lt;em&gt;wanted to have&lt;/em&gt;, and
planned to go in all together, all four of them, on the signing day
&amp;mdash; three of them being the cheerleader, while this woman …&lt;/p&gt;</summary><content type="html">&lt;figure class="col s12"&gt;

&amp;mdash; three of them being the cheerleader, while this woman put down
the signature.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So far, business as usual, though there have many BS in between which,
if I were my friend, would have dropped the fxxx bomb, "fxxx it! This
isn't even my responsibility! If you want to play game, go fxxx
yourself, see if I care."... oh well well, so my friend is pretty
patient. So here comes the twist, or, should I say, the climax of this
BS drama ~~&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The night of their agreement, and we are talking just hours now before
the signing day, the woman announced, &lt;em&gt;in a casual way&lt;/em&gt;, "oh btw, I
went to Macao a few days ago, and just got a notice that I need to be
quarantined for 14 days", then, out of her little shitty brain, she
attached a photo copy of the notice, as proof, but then, on paper it
says, &lt;em&gt;starting date: 7/31&lt;/em&gt;, and all this was happening the night of
8/3!!!! WTF!!!! Amazing, isn't it!? You know, talking about being both
shameless and stupid, unbelievable! So this whole thing is now indeed
like dropping a bomb in the lake, because just as I'm writing, China
is into another round of strict lockdown and high alert due to new
waves of corvid-19 new cases over there. So, she took a trip, fine,
her own business, but she didn't reveal this to the partners (which,
btw, all call each other &lt;strong&gt;friends&lt;/strong&gt;, wow) either before or during the
gathering, then, she thought how convenient and convincing this would
be to not show up for the signing, as she has always been wishing,
wow, what a scheme!!! Now, all her &lt;em&gt;friends&lt;/em&gt; are exposed, potentially,
and they now would have to report their risk, and quarantine
themselves, also.... what kind of person is this! This is totally fxxx
up!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So this whole thing is like a reality show to me, and very
disturbing. For one, I feel bad for my friend who had to deal with
such a nasty situation while she is managing the operation of this
entire business as the CEO (the others are just board members, but
with unlimited BS power!), and she is the only one who is worried
about the lease deadline. But really, how could anyone with a brain
not to realize that this lease is one of the two necessary conditions
for this business to even exist (the other being a license). So
without this lease, they are fxxx-ed. Isn't this as obvious as it can
be!? Even if this woman has this crazy tendency, it is just insane to
choose this moment to manifest her strong will and god knows
what. This is not insanity. This is pure stupidity.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And over there I have found a lot of them &amp;mdash; they may be &lt;em&gt;smart&lt;/em&gt;,
in the sense of being cunning and manipulating, but they lack the
basic analytical mind, and have no clue what is important and what is
secondary. I think they have been so used to the &lt;em&gt;everything is
possible, everything is by my will&lt;/em&gt; kind of baby arrogance, that they
dismiss any written agreement even they had signed it, any words they
have said, any plan they have agreed... just by a whim of will, she
thinks the whole earth will stop and turn the other way, if she says
so. I don't understand why a person could think this way, because this
is really to me unthinkable, not part of a possibility. But these,
&lt;em&gt;dreamers&lt;/em&gt;?, can certain dream, dare to wish, and no hesitation to
demand.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Back in the days, I would have said that one day life will teach them
the lesson, and they would fall/hurt. But now, honestly, I don't wish
them these at all. Be successful as they are, be rich as they are,
being as sincerely believing in whatever they believe in as they do,
carry on, your path is fine, just that I wish no part of it, and would
never want to take. That's all.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The fiasco of Didi has not yet got me off the hook, now there is the
EDU, the New Oriental that was the crown jewel of english tutoring
service 20+ years back when I was still young and battling
TOEFL/GRE. Some wall street hedge fund guy said DIDI was a political
terrorism by the Chinese government against US investors.... now I
think the decision of k12 education is even worse than that &amp;mdash;
it's a terrorism on people's brain, in particular, on kids whose
future is yet to be unfolded, but now shut.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This reminds the Christianity before the reformation, that yes there
is God, but guess what, you can't get hold of a bible (because it's
sacred and rare and expansive, a book was expansive in general), and
you can't talk to Him directly except through priest, and his message
is only known to you layman through the mouth of our priests, by their
interpretation... what changed this was the printing technology. Now
book becomes cheaper, layman can now afford a copy, of course …&lt;/p&gt;</summary><content type="html">&lt;figure class="col s12"&gt;

book becomes cheaper, layman can now afford a copy, of course, the
more forbidden it is, the better price it can fetch for the seller, so
now there are more copies in people's hands, and led to more
opinion/interpretation of the &lt;em&gt;idea&lt;/em&gt;, which then caused individual to
think why I have to speak to Him through a middleman, and btw, that
middleman hasn't been correct, nor consistent, nor even honest by many
measures, so was the reformation...In other words, I'm wondering, if
we are to kill K12, what's the basis to support it? Reformation was
founded on printing, what will this move be founded upon? I think it
has to be technology, also. Ideology is just, talk. In order to
achieve anything physically different, the mindware itself isn't
enough, it has to marry with something real, something fundamental in
people's daily life, in order to has its effect.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So, technology. Here is a paper published by some US researchers on
&lt;a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2106.02167"&gt;the GFW&lt;/a&gt;, quite entertaining to read actually, because again, it's
an example how ridiculously crude the implementation is as a trademark
of the craftsmanship of so called engineering work over there. This
reminds me the BS back in the 90s when some company received this
tremendous amount of fund by the government, developed an &lt;em&gt;anti-virus&lt;/em&gt;
software which blacklisted also porn sites and others, but its data
files were locally stored (grantedly the Internet was not yet as it is
today), and were deciphered within a day by Carnegie Mellon, and
results published (as study paper if I recall), and the blacklist
became a comprehensive yellow page to all the porn sites which I
didn't know, but now know :) hahaha.... not only because Carnegie is
good, but the company only used the common zip to zip its data file,
and didn't have any particular tech edge in the space of so called
security, implementation was probably good enough to fool a
computer-illiterate, but to ppl like Carnegie or myself, the clue is
as obvious as daylight. So it's the same in many of the projects I got
involved since, and so is this GFW paper reveals &amp;mdash; for god sake,
how stupid could it be to create a regex that miss fires on any DNS
contains "99"!.. I mean, come on, where is your test data set? Have
you ever measured your false positive rate and false negative
rate?...oh well.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Priest is nothing but a channel of knowledge, knowledge as the
product, and ppl as the consumer. Therefore, any control is only to
decide which of the three parts one want, or can, control. Apparently,
producers are not doable these days anymore. Back in the days, there
was only one copy of the Bible (presumably only one copy as the real
one, though I'm sure many different versions were in circulation),
like there is only brand of car you can buy, the "you can have any
color you want as long as it is black". But now, many of the producers
are outside its control, abroad for example, and many &lt;em&gt;consumers&lt;/em&gt; are
also producers (as everyone is publishing all kinds of ideas/opinions
all the time). Therefore, it is not possible to control that end.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What about the receiving end? Well, in the way that is exactly what
has been, by telling you what you should like/dislike, what you buy,
and so on, brainwash, propaganda, whatever the name is called, the
whole point is to construct a Truman's world, that you would be made
to believe the sky is actually pink, if I so decide. However, this
becomes a sheer number game &amp;mdash; with that many brains walking
around, it's hard to identify outlier, and it's hard to prevent new
outliers, either. Even with them being the minority, it's concerning
because the system is based on uniformity, like a dam, can't afford
the slightest crack.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This leaves to the only option, which is the channel. Now this becomes
a pure business case &amp;mdash; five force. Who are your competitors? Who
are your alternatives? ... then, of course, the ideal setup is,
monopoly. By being the only player in the field, a business gains the
most power over consumer and vendor, and maximizes its profits while
sacrificing both ends. Of course it has been universally proven to be
a bad idea because it is super wasteful. But, if nothing stops you,
any business naturally grows towards monopoly, so will be a
government, and I believe this is happening.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So K12 is just yet another step in the direction of monopoly. This
time, the vendor is the knowledge and ideas, and the consumers are,
k12. If human mind has infinite capacity and possibility to create
something good and wonderful as if a lightening has struck, then it
is equally elasticity to be compressed, depressed, distorted, without
showing much sign of damage... I don't know what this is going to
be. But I firmly believe, a damage is a damage, like a bug, you pay
the price sooner or later, if you are aware of it but not to fix it.&lt;/p&gt;</content><category term="thoughts"></category><category term="thoughts"></category></entry><entry><title>Heat, Evening</title><link href="https://fengxia41103.github.io/myblog/heat%20evening.html" rel="alternate"></link><published>2021-07-12T19:50:00-04:00</published><updated>2021-07-12T19:50:00-04:00</updated><author><name>Feng Xia</name></author><id>tag:fengxia41103.github.io,2021-07-12:/myblog/heat evening.html</id><summary type="html">&lt;figure class="col s12"&gt;

&lt;p&gt;What is this? Suddenly, I feel this, sadness, inside me. Just
played/practiced two hours in this heat evening. Maybe it's the heat?
But why such a sadness? Because Noah is not here? No. It's not
that. The call to Aunt Tam after Uncle Tam passed away?
Probably. Hearing her voice is both making me less worried about her,
and worried, at the same time.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Listening to this video, the two stand up comedians, talked about
their divorce. I don't have any particular feel of any of the two,
yet, when they were reading letters written to each other, it felt,
pain. Yes, pain, a tremendous pain... I can't picture myself sitting
there to read out loud a letter addressed to me from someone so dear
in life, it will be, too hard.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I don't know. Maybe it reminds me my life. Maybe it's the heat, or the
evening, playing guitar always brings me through time, through space,
as if I were sitting on the stool looking at that remote hill w/ the
pagoda, it's …&lt;/p&gt;</summary><content type="html">&lt;figure class="col s12"&gt;

as if I were sitting on the stool looking at that remote hill w/ the
pagoda, it's a place so far far far away, but I'm glad I was there,
feel like it was long long long time ago, almost like watching a
movie, but which music to put on? I couldn't think of a song, not a
song, that would fit the tune, I don't know, it's a moment in life
that is dear, deeply buried, can not forget.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Maybe it's all of these, the stories, the people, the places I went,
the words I spoke, the sunsets I watched, the another-me at that
place, at that time. Life is indeed a sand in hand, dripping away, no
return, no pause, not even much of a start, nor an end, yea there is
an end to it, but it isn't death, really, I start to wonder maybe
there is an after life, or another life, or many many rounds of life
after, merry go around, but not a merry I guess, each round, is
another play unfold, another story to be told, another so many years
of pulling through, but having no past, nor future, just another
cycle, going around.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Sunset is as pretty as everyday. Heat wave is abating a little w/ some
gentle breeze. Life is not bad actually. Can't complain really. But
then, here, a cloud of sadness, inside, like the sky I'm looking at,
nothing special, but real... maybe I'm missing her again. Maybe, I
have nothing left, to shine.&lt;/p&gt;</content><category term="thoughts"></category><category term="thoughts"></category></entry><entry><title>Walking in Brooklyn</title><link href="https://fengxia41103.github.io/myblog/walking%20in%20brooklyn.html" rel="alternate"></link><published>2021-06-23T21:42:00-04:00</published><updated>2021-06-23T21:42:00-04:00</updated><author><name>Feng Xia</name></author><id>tag:fengxia41103.github.io,2021-06-23:/myblog/walking in brooklyn.html</id><summary type="html">&lt;figure class="col s12"&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We walked a lot today, all the way to the uptown, ground zero, Empire
State, then back to the Manhattan Bridge and back.  Then in the
evening we took a walk around Brooklyn. Watching people go by, sitting
here and there, all colors, all kinds, some in gym clothes, some
jogging, some heading home perhaps, some hanging out w/ friends, some
just wondering around, some w/ family, some look like a student, some
homeless or the like, walking by a couple gyms and see people
working out inside... noise, humming and talking and loud cars and
motorcycles, everywhere, w/ the backdrop a beautiful evening air
decorated by a magnificent hue of red in the sky, it felt, both
alive, and struggling.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In a city of over 10 million people, walking on the street, living in
this corner of the giant map, makes you feel insignificant, absolutely
nobody. Motorbikes for food deliveries are becoming a city scene, as
if I were in Shanghai. All these people, are living somewhere, making

nobody. Motorbikes for food deliveries are becoming a city scene, as
if I were in Shanghai. All these people, are living somewhere, making
a living somehow, doing something, trying (I suppose) to find him/her
self. It is overwhelming. For the first time I start to understand
that city life is a lot to take. Out of these 10 million people, what
is the odds you could meet someone who likes you also? I don't
know. There are plenty couples on the street, in restaurants, friends
chatting to each other, all dress well, all pretty to look at. Yet, I
feel it's a city of reality show almost, that they each holding onto
each other, so each feels not completely alone, feels belong to, even
though I don't know what that means, belonging to, what?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The city? the place? the people they know? career? dream?... what is
it? Why doing the work out in a gym on this street? For pleasing
yourself? Then what?... It's a need of an identity, that as a sand on
a beach, each still yearns to have one uniqueness whatever it may
be. So some have a loud card, some wear bright color, some work out a
bubble butt, some do this and that...&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I was talking to Noah about how strange it will be that you could make
a name for yourself in a city like NYC, like "you are the best ___"
kind of thing. Then, I said, I do know the best badminton player in
NYC, the girl from whom I got 1 point, and what a highlight of my life
that was! So I guess it is possible to be known, though still, I don't
know how meaningful that is at all. Maybe she lives right here on this
block. Maybe she is walking around near me, sitting in a bar drinking
w/ friends, playing somewhere... another sand on the beach, even
though me, another sand also, knows her existence, and admires her
deeply.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;How strange this is.&lt;/p&gt;</content><category term="thoughts"></category><category term="thoughts"></category></entry><entry><title>Travel to NYC</title><link href="https://fengxia41103.github.io/myblog/travel%20to%20nyc.html" rel="alternate"></link><published>2021-06-21T22:32:00-04:00</published><updated>2021-06-21T22:32:00-04:00</updated><author><name>Feng Xia</name></author><id>tag:fengxia41103.github.io,2021-06-21:/myblog/travel to nyc.html</id><summary type="html">&lt;figure class="col s12"&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Today, Uncle Tam left us. Jookun came to join us for breakfast before
Noah and I leave for NYC, then his phone ringed. It was both a
shocker, and expected. It's hard. 谭伯母 called a bit later, talked
some, hard time. Good thing that both daughters are here, so he went
with all his families near by. It's never easy, but this is the best
one could wish for. Thought of scenes playing badminton w/ him in
MIT. Felt like forever ago. Hard to believe, yet, it's the way it is.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Traveling in train for the first time in US in my life. Felt quite
like the one in China. Four hours went by quickly w/ Noah playing
Sanguo. I think he go the hang of it towards the end. Towns passing
by, ocean side at CT, reminded me the drives along the coast when I
was young, single, and enjoying my car. It was good times.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But don't know why. This trip, and regardless where I went, I felt
like a visitor. I couldn't feel I belong to these places anymore. I
feel I'm just traveling, like traveling in China on Dad's trip &amp;mdash;
everywhere was a foreign place to me, both interesting and,
irrelevant. I'm just passing by, and not even feeling of myself, like
a soul walking outside a body, watching the body going through these
physical spaces, experiencing these foods, drinks, scenes, but the
soul is only a bystander, feeling nothing. I don't know why. I think
that, after living in 517 for a year, not only there is few places
that could match the comfort it has, but I start to think that a
lovely space, just like a good looking clothes, doesn't change a thing
in your life, well, I mean, it doesn't solve a thing for you &amp;mdash;
what troubles you remains, the trouble doesn't go away, you are still
just, you, so in the end, all these are just tiny breathing gaps, like
mirages, look super good, but they are not real. So are these travels.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Have to say, walking in Coolidge Corner this morning feels good, nice
neighbourhood, walkable here and there, familiar shops, and
memories. Yet, the memories make the feeling harder when I think of
selling this place for good, like cutting the cord of a baby &amp;mdash;
from this point on, attachment no more, all became past, buried in the
past &amp;larr; I'm gonna miss you, miss this place, miss the myself who
had lived here, walked here, thought this home, thought that nothing
would have changed to the way they are now. Naive, perhaps, but was an
age of innocence.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Bye Uncle Tam. Thank you for playing w/ us. 走好.&lt;/p&gt;</content><category term="thoughts"></category><category term="thoughts"></category></entry><entry><title>Boston 2021</title><link href="https://fengxia41103.github.io/myblog/boston%202021.html" rel="alternate"></link><published>2021-06-17T08:01:00-04:00</published><updated>2021-06-17T08:01:00-04:00</updated><author><name>Feng Xia</name></author><id>tag:fengxia41103.github.io,2021-06-17:/myblog/boston 2021.html</id><summary type="html">&lt;figure class=""&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Back in Boston, this time, it feels, foreign. Took Noah to all the
places I knew and enjoyed, but then, every place we went, I liked
them, and also disliked them &amp;mdash; they are still the same, I still
like them very much, but I can't find excitement, the happiness inside
myself, anymore. Sitting on the new boardwalk looking over the canal,
the beautiful scene of the old Boston harbor, it's the million dollar
view one could only dream to have, perfect sunny day, Noah next to me,
really, what else could I be complaining about? Yet, it felt, remote,
a traveler sitting in a strange city, knowing this is just a break in
life, and nothing in your life will be changed by this moment. The
glass high rise standing on the spot where CrunchTime used to be is
magnificantly pretty. Yet, imagining living there is cool, but it
solves nothing &amp;larr; so I guess it is this feeling of powerless that
is really bothering me this time.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It has been a long time, I think, to finish a movie like this, without
playing anything in my hand, just sitting there, watching, watching it
without much thought even, of what the story is about, and where it is
going. Like a leave floating on a lake, wave after wave, it goes,
here, there, goes, waving around, may end up here, or there, or,
nowhere.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I think I have been too used to having the mind occupied, by work, by
book, by idea, by an anxiety that time is slipping off my hand, that
I'm getting older and older each day, and it's such an undesirable
feeling, that I feel compelled to think of something, to make the time
count. But hell. Life is pretty pointless, it is a journey, a journey
that has no map, no agenda, no purpose, just a process, someone
somehow puts you on the map, and you have to move, here and there,
till the end of it, and no tell what the end is, or where it
is …&lt;/p&gt;</summary><content type="html">&lt;figure class="col s12"&gt;

till the end of it, and no tell what the end is, or where it

friends and family, expecting a trip to Boston to see uncle Tam next
week w/ Noah, all these, add to the feeling of pointless. It's funny
that the China project received an award yesterday. What a surprise! I
feel I did the least to this project, yet, it brings award, reward,
congratulations... I would have thought it ironical in the past, not
anymore, it's the life itself, it's the truth of life, the only one,
真是无心插柳柳成荫, what do u know, really?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Makes wonder, what is life? what should I do next? Any sense to
expect, anything? Then what's the point of the rest of my time, what
for?... Like her name, Mio, like the sound of a cat meowing,
cute. So it's life, a slow paced life, like a slow moving train,
clonking clonking clonking, unpleasant, not stopping, just clonking,
clonking. Maybe that's why I start to like these Japanese movies,
sometimes even make me wonder that being old is to have a fragile
mind, that I cant enjoy or see the excitements as I used to, instead,
it's the slow motion thing, being it a movie, a music, a train, a
cloud, my cats, it's the slowness that makes me peace. I guess this is
the right way to grow, to spend time with yourself, as insignificant
as a person is comparing to this world, it really feels like a peckle
of dust, disappearing from this world, but makes no difference, and no
one would bother to notice.. a wind would go by, brush it off the face
of this earth, and that would be it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Spoke to Jookun the other day. He is under a lot of stress these
days. Understand. Kid is leaving nest for college, Uncle Tam is
letting go his fight... it feels sad. I imagined the moment I went to
see him, both happy and sad. I don't know how well I would hold, I'll
try, even though I really don't know. Well, even if I cry, so let it
be, it's how I feel then, and I am sad that he is leaving us for
good... All the older generation has such a day, but w/ all these
mental preparations, it makes slight difference when it's here, just
like sometimes I looked back at my own life, at the dates and loves
and breakups, I could rationalize all of them w/ my words and
thoughts, but in the end, they all felt sad, profoundly sad, like a
cliff and endless land, no end, no end.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I used to think my function is to bring happiness to people around me,
to make their lives better because of me, and I used to think this is
one thing I could do well, and will continue to do so, if all else
fail me. Now, I don't know. I still try, but I feel it's a wall right
in front of my eyes, I don't know now whether I could climb over it, I
even think there is no point of battling because I'm doomed to
lose. Funny the only courage I'm picking up is to think of my mom
&amp;mdash; as much as I have an opinion of her, she has courage, and that
is indeed respectful. I also start to realize how life is going to
abandon everyone, eventually, and living to your own heart is such a
difficult thing that, for me, I have been extremely lucky to do so in
most of the my life so far. Sometimes I wonder how much longer this
life is going to be, maybe it is young, maybe it's ending, both are,
unpleasant.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I don't know. Haven't written for a while. Couldn't feel myself, what
to write, no urge, no thoughts, not much feelings either. Tried to
keep myself busy, but that's totally illusion. Yes there are plenty
things in life to fix and to keep moving. But no, they are all
superficial to the point that I know it's not me, not how I felt. &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/gp/video/detail/B08QV47VSG/ref=atv_wl_hom_c_unkc_1_1"&gt;Mio
on the Shore&lt;/a&gt;, I want a small shop, work hard to keep it open, till
I'm really really old, and that's actually good.&lt;/p&gt;</content><category term="thoughts"></category><category term="thoughts"></category></entry><entry><title>Logic Fallacies</title><link href="https://fengxia41103.github.io/myblog/logic%20fallacies.html" rel="alternate"></link><published>2021-05-05T15:05:00-04:00</published><updated>2021-05-05T15:05:00-04:00</updated><author><name>Feng Xia</name></author><id>tag:fengxia41103.github.io,2021-05-05:/myblog/logic fallacies.html</id><summary type="html">&lt;p&gt;Ever since I wrote &lt;a href="https://fengxia41103.github.io/myblog/burden of proof.html"&gt;burden of proof&lt;/a&gt;, I have been longing to take
notes of this topic &amp;mdash; logic fallacies. Over the last few years I
found myself more and more sensitive to these fallacies and, like new
parents who all of sudden seeing kids everywhere which they never
noticed before theirs was born, I see and hear these fallacies all
over the place. They are so prevalent that I seriously wonder whether
there is a way to make these knowledge/training more accessible to
large population so that people can start applying them in their
day-2-day life. I know the idea is likely hopeless &amp;larr; after all,
how many of us even remember or utilize the knowledge and training we
have had from school years? But still, I think it's worth an effort to
promote them, and even without leaving a mark and changing a person, I
believe having a louder voice would eventually make them heard, by a
few, and the number of those few would be growing.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;formal fallacy&lt;/strong&gt;: error in argument's form …&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;</summary><content type="html">&lt;p&gt;Ever since I wrote &lt;a href="https://fengxia41103.github.io/myblog/burden of proof.html"&gt;burden of proof&lt;/a&gt;, I have been longing to take
notes of this topic &amp;mdash; logic fallacies. Over the last few years I
found myself more and more sensitive to these fallacies and, like new
parents who all of sudden seeing kids everywhere which they never
noticed before theirs was born, I see and hear these fallacies all
over the place. They are so prevalent that I seriously wonder whether
there is a way to make these knowledge/training more accessible to
large population so that people can start applying them in their
day-2-day life. I know the idea is likely hopeless &amp;larr; after all,
how many of us even remember or utilize the knowledge and training we
have had from school years? But still, I think it's worth an effort to
promote them, and even without leaving a mark and changing a person, I
believe having a louder voice would eventually make them heard, by a
few, and the number of those few would be growing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;category&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;formal fallacy&lt;/strong&gt;: error in argument's form.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;propositional fallacy&lt;/strong&gt;: an error that concerns compound
  propositions. This is an error in compounded bool logics, eg. &lt;code&gt;if A
  and B&lt;/code&gt; can only be True when both A &amp;amp; B are true. Think like coding.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;quantification fallacy&lt;/strong&gt;: the quantifiers of the premises are in
  contradiction to the quantifier of the conclusion.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;formal syllogistic fallacies&lt;/strong&gt;: logical fallacies that occur in
  syllogisms.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;informal fallacy&lt;/strong&gt;: premise is weak. This is the most prevalent family
  of fallacies I see in everyday life.
  -faulty generalization&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;Faulty generalization&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ah, &lt;a href="https://fengxia41103.github.io/myblog/generalization.html"&gt;generalization&lt;/a&gt;! I thought I was going nuts when I wrote that
blog, because it felt so common sense so that I felt it is completely
inevitable. Yet in some many times I felt so, wrong! But I couldn't
pinpoint what went wrong. I mean, I could argument what the logic
didn't stand, or at least, was weak/insufficient, but I couldn't
really categorize it so to know exactly why it was so. But here, &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Faulty_generalization#Hasty_generalization"&gt;wiki&lt;/a&gt;
is my friend. At least now I start to learn what these generalizations
are all about &amp;mdash; in layman's term, this is when we jump to a
conclusion of a group when only small number of samples have been
presented so.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Faulty generalization comes in many flavors which will be discussed in
details below. The overall theme is that the arguer makes a conclusion
on a faulty sample &amp;mdash; samples too small, biased, exceptions are
deliberated ignored or excluded altogether without giving a
consideration or a reason... therefore, without presenting the entire
picture, the conclusion is not only skewed, but could have been
pre-determined, thus the argument isn't even genuine at all but w/
only an aim to win his argument, so what I would call arguing for
arguing's sake&lt;sup id="fnref:1"&gt;&lt;a class="footnote-ref" href="#fn:1"&gt;1&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;representative sampling&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Before going into generalization, let's look at this, sampling. The
entire category of faulty generalization is pointing to this exact
concept being misused in various forms.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sampling_(statistics)"&gt;Sampling&lt;/a&gt; is a deep topic on itself. The key here is that
&lt;strong&gt;without defining clearly the space of the samples covered in a
discussion, there has simply no point of further argument&lt;/strong&gt; because
arguer can/will apply techniques to build case, thus inevitably
committing the faults illustrated below. Continue to argue upon such
faulty foundation would go nowhere. So, the notes below are to help us
identify and pinpoint exactly what technique is used in hiding these
shaky samples.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So, what is representative sampling? First of all, it is &lt;strong&gt;not always
random sampling&lt;/strong&gt;, because fundamentally it should be determined by
definition of the &lt;strong&gt;characteristics the group has&lt;/strong&gt; in your view! For
example, if we are to investigate something about man vs. woman in
this world, random sampling N men vs. N women is only &lt;em&gt;representative&lt;/em&gt;
if we share the &lt;strong&gt;assumption&lt;/strong&gt; that population is roughly half men
vs. half women! But moving this to some geo where the number of men is
quite more than one of women, random sampling is clearly &lt;strong&gt;not
representative&lt;/strong&gt; anymore!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Therefore, one should first define these characteristics, thus serving
as the outter-most boundary of the following argument. Once we are
both clear about what we are to mean, we then move on to examine these
samples against its group. Only when we consider the samples being
representative should we embark the argument. Otherwise, it's just a
waste of time.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;hasty generalization&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Quite a few alternative calling of the same idea:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;proof by example&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Underpowered generalization&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Illicit generalization&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Fallacy of insufficient sample&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Generalization from the particular&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Leaping to a conclusion&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Blanket statement&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Hasty induction&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Law of small numbers&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Unrepresentative sample&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Secundum_quid"&gt;Secundum quid&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;They all mean the same thing, that:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;X is true for A.
X is true for B.
Therefore, X is true for C, D, E, etc.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The key here is that &lt;strong&gt;the evidence is not sufficient&lt;/strong&gt;. I like the
example in wiki (below) because I see this played out everywhere in
form of a tourist commenting a new place, of its people, or the so
called &lt;strong&gt;bias against 河南人&lt;/strong&gt;, etc.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For example, if a person travels through a town for the first time and
sees 10 people, all of them children, they may erroneously conclude
that there are no adult residents in the town.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What's the cure!? Fundamentally, the challenge should be directed at
sophist's sample group:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;how many samples out of the group s/he is basing the claim on, and&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;how do we know the sample is &lt;strong&gt;representative&lt;/strong&gt;, eg. selected
  randomly. In other words, one must present his/her sample selection
  criteria and procedure in order to allow examination of sample bias
  &amp;mdash; this is truly the most common fault of &lt;em&gt;garbage in, garbage
  out&lt;/em&gt; sceario &amp;mdash; if I screwed the sample, whether intentionally
  or not, I have certainly screwed the result.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;when it is correct&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I didn't expect this one! I thought faulty generalization are all,
wrong. But, boy, am I wrong! There are indeed cases when faulty
generalization, a logic fallacy, &lt;strong&gt;leads to correct
conclusion&lt;/strong&gt;. However, they are only so under a condition:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;if it leads from a singular premise to an existential conclusion
(i.e. proving that a claim is true for at least one case, instead of
for all cases)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;-- Ref: &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Proof_by_example"&gt;proof by example&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So, if the claim is only applied to eliminate an absolute
(eg. absolutely all this or all that), then yes, this works.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;slothful induction&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is the opposite to hasty generalization, &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Slothful_induction"&gt;wiki&lt;/a&gt; has a pretty
good example:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;An example of slothful induction might be that of a careless man who
has had twelve accidents in the last six months and it is strongly
evident that it was due to his negligence or rashness, yet keeps
insisting that it is just a coincidence and not his fault.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Its logical form is: evidence suggests X results in Y, yet the person
in question insists Y was caused by something else.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Searching for "how to rebut slothful induction" didn't come up
much. But I hit on a [tweeter post] about Corvid-19 vs. flu, pretty
good one, and boy, I feel ashamed now, that I have committed the same
fallacy as this author has pointed out.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here, the author pointed out that we are jumping to conclusion because
the existing premises are not sufficient to the conclusion.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The argument here is that COVID-19 deaths are less than flu deaths
therefore COVID-19 is less of a threat. But this argument is logically
invalid: the conclusion doesn't follow from the premises. Therefore
you need to add any hidden assumptions that make the argument valid.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://pbs.twimg.com/media/EUoC01uWsBQBvoo?format=jpg&amp;amp;name=900x900"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Rather, there is another &lt;strong&gt;hidden premise (P3)&lt;/strong&gt;, that death toll by
Corvid will continue to be less than the flu, which apparently is not:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://pbs.twimg.com/media/EUoDQ9ZWsA8-YuD?format=jpg&amp;amp;name=900x900"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Therefore, by ignoring the evidence of Corvid death, the statement
that Corvid is less than a flu was committing this slothful induction
fallacy.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Brilliant.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;overwhelming exception&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is an interesting one. I can't say where I encounter this. The
samples by wiki seem to be mostly used in comedies. The key of this
fallacy is in its &lt;strong&gt;qualifications&lt;/strong&gt;, which will eliminate so many
&lt;em&gt;exceptions&lt;/em&gt; of the claim that essentially makes the original claim
nothing but an empty shell. What comes to mind is the famous model T
color choice:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Any customer can have a car painted any colour that he wants, so
long as it is black.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;-- by Henry Ford&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So, watch out for qualification that creates exceptions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;accident&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Came across &lt;a href="http://fallacyfiles.org/accident.html"&gt;this website&lt;/a&gt;, excellent example:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Birds normally can fly.
Tweety the Penguin is a bird.
Therefore, Tweety can fly.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What went wrong? The key is in the first statement, "Birds normally
can fly." &amp;mdash; it is a rule of thumb, which is &lt;strong&gt;generally true but
has exception&lt;/strong&gt;, and the 2nd line apparently is that exception!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;rule of thumb&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What is a rule of thumb? It's easier to see what it is not:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://fallacyfiles.org/glossary.html#UniversalGen"&gt;universal generalization&lt;/a&gt;: A 100% or 0% statistical
   generalization, that is, a proposition that asserts that something
   is true of all or none of a class.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://fallacyfiles.org/glossary.html#StatisticalGen"&gt;statistical generalization&lt;/a&gt;: A proposition which asserts
   something of a percentage of a class. Universal generalizations are
   the special cases when the percentage equals 100% or 0%.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now, rule of thumb vs. universal generalization: the former has
exception.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now, rule of thumb vs. statistical generalization: the former actually
has a &lt;strong&gt;hidden context&lt;/strong&gt;, but that context is not applicable to the
case in point. In the example above, if we take the context of
Antarctica alone, Penguin will be the majority &lt;em&gt;bird&lt;/em&gt; there, and
viola, the rule of thumb there should be "birds don't fly!" The rule
of thumb is often spoken in a context that are close to the speaker
and his/her audiences' common life experience, therefore, "Clearly,
then, rules of thumb are specific to a cultural and temporal context."&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;All in all, rule of thumb has exception, and it's the exception that
makes the accident fallacy.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;no true Scotsman&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A particular form of Accident fallacy is this, also known as &lt;em&gt;appeal
to purity&lt;/em&gt;, because the key to this fallacy is that the arguer makes a
generalization w/o considering exception (thus, is an
Accident). However, rather then admitting the fault, he tries to
exclude exceptions so to validate his generalization. &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/No_true_Scotsman"&gt;wiki&lt;/a&gt; gives
a good example:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Person A: "No Scotsman puts sugar on his porridge."
Person B: "But my uncle Angus is a Scotsman and he puts sugar on his porridge."
Person A: "But no true Scotsman puts sugar on his porridge."
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here, the key is the last line, by using the word &lt;strong&gt;true&lt;/strong&gt;, A has
modified his original generalization (all scotsman) by excluding some
unwanted samples (now all scotsman are divided into two camps: true
and not true), but using word such as "emotionally charged but
nonsubstantive purity platitudes such as 'true, pure, genuine,
authentic, real'" to hide such modification.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Therefore, three conditions are needed to identify this fallacy:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;not publicly retreating from the initial, falsified assertion&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;offering a modified assertion that definitionally excludes a targeted unwanted counterexample&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;using rhetoric to hide the modification
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Sneaky, isn't it?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;cherry picking&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Cherry picking, suppressing evidence, or the fallacy of incomplete
evidence is the act of pointing to individual cases or data that seem
to confirm a particular position while ignoring a significant portion
of related and similar cases or data that may contradict that
position.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This sounds quite the same as ignoring exceptions. I think the key
difference is that cherry picking isn't targeted to exclude
exception. It's simply a fault when samples are ignored. Of course,
the method and the intention to formulate such ignoring will then make
the case stronger in name of Accident and so on. Therefore, cherry
picking can be viewed as a general category of such symptom.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;anecdotal evidence&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;How &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anecdotal_evidence"&gt;interesting&lt;/a&gt;! This is exactly the things I hear all the time,
and it has a name rings this bell &amp;mdash; &lt;strong&gt;"person who" fallacy&lt;/strong&gt;!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"I know a person who..."; "I know of a case where..."&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In short, it "is a factual claim relying only on personal observation,
collected in a casual or non-systematic manner". This evidence is not
automatically false. Rather, the condition is whether this evidence
can be verified using &lt;strong&gt;scientific method&lt;/strong&gt; &amp;mdash; if it can, then
evidence may have value (if proved by the investigation). Otherwise,
it's a fallacy.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is a form of cherry picking because the evidence by definition is
biased &amp;larr; I know somebody... which means my evidence came from my
close circle, which automatically excluded majority of human race
whom I don't know ~~~ What a pity.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;correlative-based fallacies&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Correlative conjunction "is a relationship between two statements
where one must be false and the other true". So be careful, it's
&lt;strong&gt;not&lt;/strong&gt; just correlation, but &lt;strong&gt;must be opposite to each other&lt;/strong&gt;. In
coding term, the conditions must be mutually exclusive so that no
third code path could occur, eg. &lt;code&gt;if A &amp;gt; 10&lt;/code&gt; is one side, then a
correlative conjunction is formed when the other side is: &lt;code&gt;else&lt;/code&gt;, or
&lt;code&gt;if A &amp;lt;=10&lt;/code&gt;. But merely &lt;code&gt;if A &amp;lt; 10&lt;/code&gt; will be a bug, because when
&lt;code&gt;A==10&lt;/code&gt;, it has no handler.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now, these type of fallacies are to play with this correlative
definition:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Presenting two as if they are the correlative conjunctions, but
   they are not &amp;rarr; false dilemma.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Denying the correlative: introduce a 3rd option into the
   correlatives. In other words, when presented a Yes-No question, the
   answer is anything other than Y-N, 答非所问.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Suppressed correlative: try to redefine one correlative so that
   they &lt;strong&gt;lose contrast&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;false dilemma/false correlative&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/False_dilemma"&gt;This&lt;/a&gt; is a good one. It is "based on a premise that erroneously
limits what options are available". This picture illustrates the point
well:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;figure class="col s12"&gt;
  &lt;img
  src="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/False_dilemma#/media/File:Young_America's_dilemma_-_Dalrymple._LCCN2010651418.jpg"/&gt;
  &lt;figcaption&gt;false dilemma (credit: [wiki][14])&lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is also a common case in everyday's communication, when I
sometimes plays this devil to Noah by presenting to him only two
options: doing his homework A or homework B ~~ Apparently he would
grow out of this dilemma by one day realizing he could also go out and
play, or just ignore me entirely, and I could do nothing about,
hahaha.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This isn't cherry picking because the problem isn't in the sample, but
in its conclusion (only two options presented while more options are
deliberately excluded by default&lt;sup id="fnref:2"&gt;&lt;a class="footnote-ref" href="#fn:2"&gt;2&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;denying the correlative&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Pretty straightforward. When asked a Y/N question, you don't answer w/
yes or not, but something else, as if it is also an option (which it
must not be):&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Judge: So did you kill your landlord or not?
Kirk: I fought with him.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;suppressed correlative&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This can be called &lt;em&gt;fallacy of relativity&lt;/em&gt;, because the key here is
one makes the original contrast &lt;strong&gt;impossible&lt;/strong&gt; by changing the definition,
or mudding the definition's scope. This is especially true when
adjectives are used, eg. "good man" vs. "evil man", well, I could
claim any man good or evil when I shift around its definition,
couldn't I!? What a mess.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;argument to moderation&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"Also known as false compromise, argument from middle ground, and the
golden mean fallacy" (ref: &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Argument_to_moderation"&gt;wiki&lt;/a&gt;). I like the example in wiki:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;An example of a fallacious use of the argument to moderation would
be to regard two opposed arguments &amp;mdash; one person saying that
the sky is blue, while another claims that the sky is in fact
yellow, and conclude that the truth is that the sky is green.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While green is the colour created by combining blue and yellow,
therefore being a compromise between the two positions, the sky is
obviously not green, demonstrating that taking the middle ground of
two positions does not always lead to the truth.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In particular, I like the phrase that "the middle ground between the
big lie of Soviet propaganda and the truth was itself a lie, and one
should not be looking for a middle ground between information and
disinformation."&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;disinformation&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Disinformation"&gt;Fascinating&lt;/a&gt;! It is "false information with the intention to
deceive public opinion". In today's world, this is synonymous to a lie
and propaganda.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;continuum fallacy/wronger than wrong&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://rationalwiki.org/wiki/Continuum_fallacy"&gt;This&lt;/a&gt; is a good explanation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;P1: X is one extreme and Y is the opposite extreme.
P2: There is no definable point where X becomes Y.
C: Therefore, there is no difference between X and Y.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"In general, the fallacy takes situations where no clear cut-off point
between X and Y exists, and either a) denies that any distinction
really exists and commits an equivocation between both or b) takes
advantage of the lack of distinction by arbitrarily shifting the
distinction to unrealistic positions."&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The key in this fallacy is to downplay a stopping point between the
two extremes. In other words, even when there is a clear &lt;em&gt;line&lt;/em&gt; when
one transits from one state/extreme into another, the fallacy says
&lt;em&gt;there isn't&lt;/em&gt;, thus is the trick. But what if the line isn't there?
Ah! So be careful, this fallacy isn't about definition of the line,
but that it's ignoring the degree of truthfulness of the two
extremes. For example, saying "earth is flat" as one extreme and
"earth is round" as the other, are both actually incorrect (earth
isn't pure round, but &lt;em&gt;an oblate spheroid&lt;/em&gt;). However, the degree of it
being flat is magnitudely &lt;strong&gt;not truth&lt;/strong&gt; than its being
round. Therefore, it's a fallacy to claim both are &lt;strong&gt;equally false&lt;/strong&gt;
because both are not true.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is further discussed in &lt;a href="https://rationalwiki.org/wiki/Wronger_than_wrong"&gt;wronger than wrong&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;argument from ignorance&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The pattern of this fallacy is this:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Statement &lt;code&gt;p&lt;/code&gt; is unproved &amp;rarr; &lt;code&gt;Not-p&lt;/code&gt; is true.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Statement &lt;code&gt;not-p&lt;/code&gt; is unproved &amp;rarr; &lt;code&gt;p&lt;/code&gt; is true.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I think this the exact logic behind the phrase 敌人的敌人一定是朋友
&amp;larr; of course this is not true, because s/he could also be another
enemy, or a neutral.  This seems obvious that even in the space of &lt;code&gt;p&lt;/code&gt;
vs. &lt;code&gt;not-p&lt;/code&gt;, which form a correlative conjunction, not proving &lt;code&gt;p&lt;/code&gt;
doesn't warrant the &lt;code&gt;not-p&lt;/code&gt; is now true &amp;mdash; eg. because you can't
prove me a male, doesn't automatically make me a female.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This one is quite confusing because it sound very much to the "If A,
then B &amp;rarr; if not B, then not A" logic. But they are different. The
latter is strictly correct, but this fallacy is not. This fallacy is
saying, if you can't prove &lt;code&gt;not B leads to A&lt;/code&gt;, then not B must lead to not A, therefore, becomes correct.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This fallacy is a common technique to shift the &lt;a href="https://fengxia41103.github.io/myblog/burden of proof.html"&gt;burden of proof&lt;/a&gt;,
meaning that arguer takes a position in this fallacy, but without
backing himself up w/ evidence, simply asking the rebuttal to prove
the &lt;code&gt;not-p&lt;/code&gt;, and if s/he can't, arguer &lt;em&gt;wins&lt;/em&gt; &amp;larr; this is pretty
BS, isn't it?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But, be careful, this has &lt;strong&gt;non-fallacious uses&lt;/strong&gt; in science, law and
some specific application. For practical reason, one must &lt;em&gt;assume&lt;/em&gt; the
&lt;code&gt;not-p&lt;/code&gt; is true is you can't prove the &lt;code&gt;p&lt;/code&gt;. For example, "the
assumption of innocence until proved guilty" is a practical, not a
logical, process. In this, &lt;code&gt;p=guilty&lt;/code&gt;, if you can't prove &lt;code&gt;p&lt;/code&gt;, the
&lt;code&gt;not-p=innocent&lt;/code&gt; must be &lt;strong&gt;assumed&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;equivocation&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;谐音梗, or 偷换概念.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;ambiguous middle term&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Since only man [human] is rational.
And no woman is a man [male].
Therefore, no woman is rational.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"The first instance of "man" implies the entire human species, while
the second implies just those who are male." Equivocation, however, is
a great example of humor ~~&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This, in more strict term, is called &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fallacy_of_four_terms"&gt;fallacy of four terms&lt;/a&gt;,
because the double-meaning word introduced a fourth term while
&lt;strong&gt;exactly three and three alone&lt;/strong&gt; can be there. Using the examples
from &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fallacy_of_four_terms"&gt;wiki&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Valid, three terms: goldfish, fish, and fin.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Major premise: All fish have fins.
Minor premise: All goldfish are fish.
Conclusion: All goldfish have fins.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Invalid, fourth term: human.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Major premise: All fish have fins.
Minor premise: All goldfish are fish.
Conclusion: All humans have fins.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now as you can see, in equivocation fallacy, though not a new word is
introduced, but the meaning of one of the three terms has been changed
from one context to another, thus make actually 4 instead of 3! Again,
using the example above:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Since only man [human] is rational.
And no woman is a man [male].
Therefore, no woman is rational.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On surface, three terms: man, woman, and rational. But the word "man"
has actually two meanings: human, and male. Therefore, the total terms
in this have now four: human, male, woman, rational. And by
definition, two premises are not sufficient to validate the
conclusion, therefore is a fallacy. Brilliant!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Motte &amp;amp; Bailey&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is a bit difficult one. By presenting two similar points, one
controversial and one less so, the arguer is actually promoting the
controversial one, but when attacked, s/he uses the less controversial
version (pretending these two are identical) for defense.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Person A asserts [Controversial Interpretation of Viewpoint X].
Person B critiques [Controversial Interpretation of Viewpoint X].
Person A asserts that they were actually defending [Common-Sense Interpretation of Viewpoint X].
Person B no longer has grounds to critique Person A; Person B leaves the discussion.
Person A claims victory and discreetly reverts to actually supporting
[Controversial Interpretation of Viewpoint X].
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This leads to &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Persuasive_definition"&gt;persuasive definition&lt;/a&gt;, because language can
"simultaneously communicate information (informative) and feelings
(expressive)", and the persuasive definition focuses on the expressive
part, the feeling part. This is where the M&amp;amp;B comes in &amp;mdash; the
Beiley is the controversial one, the &lt;em&gt;informative&lt;/em&gt; piece, where Motte
is the &lt;em&gt;expressive&lt;/em&gt; piece, the non-controversial piece. When Beiley is
attacked, the arguer evokes the expressive piece for defense, and when
attacker &lt;em&gt;agrees&lt;/em&gt; or &lt;em&gt;gives up&lt;/em&gt;, s/he switches to Beiley and claims it
is valid.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This strategy is very common when emotionally charged words are used,
eg. love, freedom, patriotic... they are all imprecise and
emotional. Therefore, when one says 你不怎样就不是中国人, the Beiley
is the 事， the 怎样， and the Motte is the 是中国人 &amp;mdash;
apparently, citizenship is determined by some kind of law, while I can
disagree w/ the 事儿 however way I want without breaking that law. Now
writing this, this also feels like a false dilemma, as if my option is
only either "do the thing and be a 中国人"， or "not do it and not
being a 中国人". I don't know whether this example is a good M&amp;amp;B one,
but this is what I understand it to be.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;false of accent&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Reminds me the poem when one changes accent to change it's meaning
entirely.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;I&lt;/strong&gt; didn't take the test yesterday. (Somebody else did.)
I &lt;strong&gt;didn't&lt;/strong&gt; take the test yesterday. (I did not take it.)
I didn't &lt;strong&gt;take&lt;/strong&gt; the test yesterday. (I did something else with it.)
I didn't take &lt;strong&gt;the test&lt;/strong&gt; yesterday. (I took a different one.)
I didn't take the &lt;strong&gt;test&lt;/strong&gt; yesterday. (I took something else.)
I didn't take the test &lt;strong&gt;yesterday&lt;/strong&gt;. (I took it some other day.)
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;fallacy of composition&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is similar to the hasty generalization. This is also making a
conclusion only by seeing part of the whole. &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Matthew_effect"&gt;wiki&lt;/a&gt; has some good
examples:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;If someone stands up out of their seat at a cricket match, they can
  see better. Therefore, if everyone stands up, they can all see
  better.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Some people can become millionaires with the right business
  concept. Therefore, if everyone has the right business concept,
  everyone will become a millionaire.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;If a runner runs faster, he can win the race. Therefore, if all the
  runners run faster, they can all win the race.
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now, there are also some examples which are super common (as fallacy):&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Since every part of a certain machine is light in weight, the
  machine as a whole is light in weight.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here is a tricky one. "In society, if all voters are rational, by
majority rule their collective choice will be rational." &amp;larr; &lt;strong&gt;not
true&lt;/strong&gt;! So again, the key here is the sum of components don't
necessarily bear the characteristic the arguer is wishing to promote.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But then, what does this make education? Also, what about individual's
abiding laws and being a good citizen, if individual's don't translate
into the whole? &amp;larr; wouldn't this make better sense if the fallacy
has a statistical threshold, such as "if over 50% of the parts have
this trait, the whole is likely to have it, too"? Well, in the weight
example above, this won't work either.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I think the problem of this fallacy isn't about composition, but is
that the conclusion has a hidden assumption which is not examined, and
will be violated when we move from individual to a whole. For example,
in the millionaire example, the hidden line is that there are buyers,
so the fallacy is implying that if you had right biz, all others will
be buyers... well, even this can be correct, that everyone buys
someone else' product &amp;amp; service, thus all become millionaire, except
that million dollars would then become less valuable if everyone had
it. So it's really its effect, or the hidden assumption, is the
problem here.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;fallacy of division&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is the opposite to the fallacy of composition. Here we are
drawing conclusion of a part from characteristic of a whole.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The second grade in Jefferson elementary eats a lot of ice cream&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Carlos is a second-grader in Jefferson elementary&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Therefore, Carlos eats a lot of ice cream
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;false attribution&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This fallacy is difficult to eliminate because this is really
everywhere. Misquoting or crediting to the wrong source is too easily
happen to be curable.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Matthew_effect"&gt;Matthew effect&lt;/a&gt; is interesting. Basically it's saying the more
you have, the more you will; the more famous you are today, the more
famous you will be tomorrow.... disheartening, isn't this!?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;false equivalence&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ah, &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/False_equivalence"&gt;this&lt;/a&gt; is a good one. This is to compare apple to orange. By
using a similarity between two, it draws the conclusion that they are
the same/equivalent. Of course, the equivalence is fallacy if:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The differences are in different magnitude: being a petty thief and
  being a murder are both criminals, but drawing the line that they
  are the same is a fallacy because they are difference degrees of
  criminality.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Using a similarity which has nothing to do w/ the claim.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"They're both living animals that metabolize chemical
energy. Therefore there's little difference between having a pet cat
and a pet snail."&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The "equivalence" is in factors that are not relevant to the
animals' suitability as pets.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Exactly.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;historian's fallacy&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is the &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Historian%27s_fallacy"&gt;God's view&lt;/a&gt;. We know the consequence of a historical
event. But the ppl living in that event did not. Therefore, analysis
and evaluation must be conducted only based on things they knew, not
we know today.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I'm surprised that this fallacy is only identified in 1880 and later
names in 1970!! This is rather quite new, and make me wonder what all
the analysis before these times were like, I mean, didn't they then
commit this fallacy, thus requiring a new round of re-evaluation? If
so, has it been done? and doesn't this lead to that each historical
work should require a scrutiny/test of all these fallacies? Sounds
overkill, but is alternative acceptable? I don't know.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;presentism&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This sounds very much like the &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Presentism_(literary_and_historical_analysis)"&gt;God's view&lt;/a&gt;, also. So let me try
to clarify these two. The historian's fallacy is about judging a
history as if the consequence had been known by the doers; presentism
is to pass on a judgment, in particular, in moral sense, using today's
standard.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For example, I think Corvid is a case in point of historian's fallacy
&amp;mdash; I admire fully the story of &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Presentism_(literary_and_historical_analysis)"&gt;Dr. Li&lt;/a&gt;, but I don't think
it's not a good evidence to support criticism of Chinese government's
negligence, because people who might have heard the wind of this virus
were few, and knowing such &lt;em&gt;news&lt;/em&gt; from any unofficial channel was both
confusing and incredible &amp;mdash; so, I agree that the government
committed negligence by not making the information public; but I
disagree using Dr. Li as the pawn to attack its negligence. I think
the case lies rather suppressing freedom of speech rather than of a
prophet whose prophecy was ignored.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Presentism is very difficult, in my opinion, to both avoid or to be
criticized, even. When we pass on a judgment on a historical event,
eg. foot bondage was a sin against female, it is inevitable using
today's moral standard as the reference. I don't defend these
histories being a sin or even a crime. But I do think it &lt;strong&gt;requires us
to also include discussion of how it was viewed back then in the
discussion&lt;/strong&gt;. Further, I think the key problem of presentism is in
selection of evidence &amp;mdash; if one deliberately ignore or downplay a
set of events &lt;strong&gt;mostly/purely based on his present standard&lt;/strong&gt;, then
presentism is really a cherry picking fallacy.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;homunculus fallacy&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This &lt;a href="https://www.logicallyfallacious.com/logicalfallacies/Homunculus-Fallacy"&gt;fallacy&lt;/a&gt; is a recursion function goes wrong by having a stop
condition. Response to the question is not answered, but is
&lt;em&gt;deflected&lt;/em&gt;, in a disguise that seems right at first, but if pushing
to ask more, will reveal that it's an &lt;strong&gt;infinite regression&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It seems the popular example used for this one is the vision. If we
explain how human has vision by saying a man in your brain is watching
a movie, then this leads to how he is receiving the movie, another man
in his brain, and so it regression continues.....&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I don't think this a good example, actually. But for now, it's ok. The
key of this fallacy is that response didn't answer the question, but
using a &lt;em&gt;middle man&lt;/em&gt; figure, the &lt;em&gt;homunculus&lt;/em&gt;, as the answer, as if
it's then self-evident (which is not), therefore creating this
recursion.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;inflation of conflict&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I like &lt;a href="https://www.logicallyfallacious.com/logicalfallacies/Inflation-of-Conflict"&gt;this one&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Authority A disagrees with authority B on issue X.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Therefore, we can say nothing meaningful about issue X.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"This is a form of black and white thinking -- either we know the
exact truth, or we know nothing at all." "A disagreement among experts
does not mean that both are wrong, the answer is a compromise, or that
there is no answer to be known; it simply means that there is
disagreement -- that is all we can infer."&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;relativist fallacy&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Relativist_fallacy"&gt;庄子&lt;/a&gt;, but in a fallacious way.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The relativist fallacy (or subjectivist fallacy) is a logical fallacy
that occurs when it is asserted that some fact may be true for some
people but not true for others.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is not to ignore differences in culture, custom and the
like. Rather, the key feature of this fallacy isn't in it's relative
position, but in the fact that the person "uses a mid-argument, ad hoc
switch to a relativistic view of truth in order to defend some
position, which they had previously asserted was
objective". Therefore, this makes the argument to halt because this
makes the claim &lt;strong&gt;unfalsifiable&lt;/strong&gt; &amp;larr; what I all arguing to win for
arguing's sake.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;incomplete comparison&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What a &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Incomplete_comparison"&gt;fallacy&lt;/a&gt;! This is exactly the topic I was saying earlier
this morning w/ her daughter, that English grammar requires you to
observer reasoning, such that you have to have a counterpart when
using "better than" (than what!?), or "best of" (a group of 3 or
more!).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But here it is, the fallacy is by breaking these rules, thus making a
claim "My product is better" &amp;larr; completely unrefutable because it
is &lt;strong&gt;incomplete&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;inconsistent comparison&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is interesting.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;product X is less expensive than product A, has better quality than
product B, and has more features than product C
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What's wrong!? Ah. So the intention is to say that X is the best. But
by having 3 categories here &amp;mdash; price, quality, and feature, all
we could derive is that X is not the bottom  of all three categories,
but it may be 3rd place in all categories, while A might be the ace in
2 out of three of these categories, thus being a much better product!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is the same fallacy, though jokingly, saying that I'm the best
coder in novelist, the best novelist in chef, and so on ~~&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;kettle logic&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Forget about Freud's original example. This is a better one:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the movie "Philomena", Steve Coogan's character, Martin Sixsmith,
leaves a church ceremony early. When asked why he says, "I don't
believe in God, and I think he knows."
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So 前言不搭后语, conflicting to among itself.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="footnote"&gt;
&lt;hr&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li id="fn:1"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Remember, the whole point of argument, or logic, is to seek the
&lt;strong&gt;truth&lt;/strong&gt; of the subject, not to beat down your opponent. Alas! In
politics and even in life, how many participant would remember
this when emotion takes hold, or agenda is the boss?&amp;#160;&lt;a class="footnote-backref" href="#fnref:1" title="Jump back to footnote 1 in the text"&gt;&amp;#8617;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="fn:2"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;By default&lt;/strong&gt; is another common pattern one should watch out
for, because it indicates an assumption. And as any assumption, it
must be also examined and agreed upon before proceeding w/
argument. Otherwise, the argument process has no base.&amp;#160;&lt;a class="footnote-backref" href="#fnref:2" title="Jump back to footnote 2 in the text"&gt;&amp;#8617;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Bumped into a movie introduction of this wonderful
&lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2rKZcAiLHlY"&gt;documentary/movie&lt;/a&gt;, "Faces Places". I don't know why. I'm drawn to
human faces. Since now over 17 years ago when I was working at Bit9

&lt;p&gt;Bumped into a movie introduction of this wonderful

that's why I kept those photos, that an image is worth a thousand
words, maybe, that it has more power than I, to convey the idea, the
feeling. Everytime I looked at a portrait, drawn to the eyes, shining
like a whole galaxy in itself, it is, magical.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And indeed. Like the &lt;a href="https://fengxia41103.github.io/myblog/humans in new york.html"&gt;Humans in New York&lt;/a&gt;, I can't help finding
them, wonderful. I know it's a filtered collection of samples, like a
catalog of super models, of course, they are wonderful to look at. But
then, there are also &lt;a href="https://fengxia41103.github.io/myblog/independent documentaries.html"&gt;documentaries&lt;/a&gt;, yeah I know they are also
edited, but still, the shots moved me deeply. I don't like studio
shots, and in general, I don't like staged shots, touched-up shots,
post-processing, perfect composition, all that... but I like candid
shots, like to look at a random person walking on the street, minding
his/her own business, like sitting behind a glass window watching
people passing by... maybe it's a feeling of a visitor on earth, don't
want to be tangled w/ reality, always want to be immune and
isolated.. hmm.. now to think of this, this actually isn't itself good
at all, and probably even can be called bogus, as if I could stay
above this world... but really, it's a, tendency, I guess, to not be
bounded by some gravity, free spirit? I don't know. It's just part of
me since young, and over all these years, I have been lucky to have
jobs that allow me such flexibility, or to be more accurate, I allowed
myself such freedom whether the boss liked it or not, I couldn't help
it. It's like an urge of hunger inside me, and my mind asked to not be
caged inside, anything.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Back to the film. I wonder why looking at a giant portrait can be so,
touching? I think, it's because a person, as wonderful and complex as
s/he be, is so insignificant and worthless, that they are like sand on
a beach, nobody counts them, nobody tells much of a difference, and
nobody pays attention when they step on them, and when a wave comes
and goes, they are brushed aside, flushed here and there, some went to
the bottom of sea, some moved thousand miles away from "home", some
never saw the light of day... so this is a life of a sand, a
person. But when his/her portrait is taken, is looked at, it's a
statement, a manifesto, of the existence of a complex being, right
there, a claim that "I'm here. I have been here." It's a voice, silent
may it be, but loud and distinct. Each face is an aggregation of all
its entirety of his/her past up to the moment, all the joy, sorrow,
plain, unique.. if shells of sea are beautiful because they are always
different and intricate, here we are, human faces, in the same spirit
of these shells, all different, all intricate, and all strangely
difficult yet pleasant too be looked at.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I don't know. I think the warm feeling of a portrait isn't because of
the subject, perhaps, but really, the act of someone who paid
attention to the person, took his/her photo, and that, is what warms
my heart.. so somewhere, somehow, someone, was finding a life
interesting, finding a person worth a shot, finding a moment worth
saving, and that, is what really touches us. So in the end, it's the
feeling of isolation, of loneliness, that makes us, in the end, human.&lt;/p&gt;</content><category term="thoughts"></category><category term="thoughts"></category></entry><entry><title>Chauvinism</title><link href="https://fengxia41103.github.io/myblog/chauvinism.html" rel="alternate"></link><published>2021-04-19T10:05:00-04:00</published><updated>2021-04-19T10:05:00-04:00</updated><author><name>Feng Xia</name></author><id>tag:fengxia41103.github.io,2021-04-19:/myblog/chauvinism.html</id><summary type="html">&lt;figure class="col l8 m8 s12"&gt;

  &lt;figcaption&gt;The first impression of this picture is how many females
  reporters are there, and how young they all are. If
  media/communication/opinion are so influential, isn't this then an
  argument that females are actually controlling our ears!? Of course
  not! I'm rather questioning, why so many of them are girls? Do they
  write their columns based on the info they collected here? or just
  administrative task of taking pictures, compiling bits, and let male
  reporters back in the office to formulate an opinion? If so, how
  wrong this actually is already!&lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I have heard this word when young, but never understood what it is,
nor ever cared to find out. But recently I have been thinking a lot
about feminism, or be more specific, what is a woman? This is probably
triggered by watching the &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/Couples-Therapy-Season-1/dp/B07XB7XNLJ"&gt;Couple Therapy&lt;/a&gt;, which prompted me wrote

start to realize how little I know about a woman.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I remember a Youtube video in which it started filming young girl and
boy first, asking them to use movement/gesture to illustrate what is a
run, a punch, that sort, then, moved on to an older age group, same
pair of a boy and a girl, same or similar asks, then next age group,
and so on... the video was striking, and the point it was trying to
make clear, that gender image, or so called gender differences that
are used to define, or to depict the gender's characteristics, such as
weak, gentle, calm, soft, and so on, are really an educational
phenomenon &amp;rarr; in its natural form, boys, girls, males, females,
are the same, I mean, same in sense that they are physically and
mentally the same animal. The often quoted argument that females are
generally shorter, smaller, weaker physically, are no more than we
also see them in any living species, that some individuals or group of
individuals present a larger frame, taller, and so on... it's almost
laughable in this sense that one would look down someone else because
he has a thicker nostril while the other one doesn't! .... the natural
response you would have if someone approached you for this cause would
simply be, 你有病吧 ... hahaha..&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But then, &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chauvinism"&gt;Chauvinism&lt;/a&gt;, in particular, the male chauvinism, is
everywhere. I didn't realize such a thing even though I have heard
earful of so called feminism, women's right, sexual equality, and on
and on and on.. To me, they have been nothing but a bucket of
words/labels that some people are taking interested in, fighting for
it, thinking it's the most important thing on earth, but I have no
idea, and doesn't affect my life a bit, so why should I care? But now,
I can't help confessing, how wrong was I!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After divorce and moved out, I haven't really reflected much about
relationship &amp;mdash; it's a failure in my case, so nothing to be
reflect about but admit the defeat and move on. But once a while, I
think maybe it's my engineering curiosity kicks in, that I wonder,
why, what did I miss, why the code crashed, and why it crashed in such
a way &amp;larr; if it's a bug, whether it's a bug in me, in her, or in
the interaction of ours, or something else, I have an interest to
know. It's not about learning the lesson so not to repeat it, but I
started to realize that it's inevitable to have social interaction,
and being half the population more or less, female represent a group I
can't shun from, regardless how I wish. Further, the more I observe
this life, this world, and in particular, observing Noah's growing up,
I can't help realizing how biased we have been teaching the boys about
girls, about this whole gender identity, this image &amp;larr; whenever I
was preaching Noah about being strong, independent, considerate,
responsible, I can't help wondering on the back of my mind that this
is the same bias I'm putting into him which had infested me so to
cause such a, misunderstanding, about woman, which of course led to
the failure of the marriage and all that. So, am I then teaching him
something that will cause his misery as well!? That will be totally,
bad.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So, what is woman!? First of all, I have admit, they are beautiful to
look at. Yes, there are many many of them, and many of them are simply
beautiful &amp;mdash; they are lively, energetic, smart, graceful, strong,
healthy, having all the qualities I respect and like. Then, this
sexual desire. Yes it's of course a nature's call. But then, why the
breast, or the feet, or the legs, or the hair, or whatever catches
your fancy!? why? Think about breast for a moment. This seems so
natural that I'm attracted to one, but then, why so? It's not some
childhood psycho deficiency that since infants found peace in them,
thus this trait carries into adulthood. Maybe. But really, there is
more to this. Move this admiration to a man, has anyone bragged about
his 喉结 Adam's apple, "Look at that guy's adam's apple! How sexy that
is!"... that is just, bizarre, right!? But then, breast is nothing but
an effect of sexual development, a trait that females have, just like
guys have this. So, why man stared at her breast as if it's the
ultimate desire, where his own feature in the same category bears none
of this emotion!?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I think it's a cliche that sexual feature is always defined in scope
of a culture &amp;mdash; as the urban legend that Tang dynasty likes plum
girls, and some tribes use tattoos here and there, and so on and so
forth. As I have said before, if you look at a group of monkeys, you
know what, one monkey is deadly attractive because of her beauty, yet,
to you/me, I feel, nothing! So, same here. It's really a man-made
message that we are propagating from one generation to the next, being
part of the heritage/culture, that such image of a gender is formed,
then is used as a mold to require/form women to follow. In history if
China had misfortune of 贞洁牌坊， then now I can see the same mold is
in every culture, different name, but same stuff.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So to Chauvinism, this male chauvinism. In recent years while working
in China, I have witnessed, heard, debated, and tried to stand up in
my capacity against male debasing a female without realizing this
could be a two-way conversation. Not only it was shocking to hear
someone as intelligent and well doing as a young manager in his 30s
&lt;strong&gt;bragged&lt;/strong&gt; about his mom supporting his fight w/ his wife by saying
"I'll find a better wife for you.", but it was almost sad when we were
cleaning up racks of clothes, and the HR girl, whom I thought was as
independent and strong as any I know, deliberately didn't want to hire
woman because they will have maternity leave. I mean, I am not
criticizing them here. I'm thinking of them in this article because it
was an experience I wasn't prepared for, and when I heard their
sayings and reasoning, I was surprised, surprised that both sex
displayed the same trait, the same bias, and were propelling the same
static culture/image of woman.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Myself has plenty of this bias. I wouldn't excuse myself that "my
father told me so".. part of it, yes, but also, by myself, I have long
been feeling that women are beautiful, and their job in life should
be, just that. By having such a view ingrained, I constantly would
find it, what will be the word, annoying? intimidating?, when the one
I started to know well displayed as strong a mind, as strong an
opinion, as strong a stand of a decision, as I would have done myself!
So yes, I believe what I had experience is just that, the male
chauvinism. Why would I be surprised, or annoyed, or intimidated?  The
only explanation would be, that I myself had not thought of them in
par as myself, I had undervalued their capability, capacity, and was
still in position of looking down from a higher position,
mentally. How pathetic was I!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But how to change this? How to change, myself? I don't know. I feel I
know nothing about woman. Maybe it's too late of a time in life to
gain that knowledge. But this should be a warning to everyone, that
bias, this gender bias, is not only not dead, it is actually quite
popular and strong. It's everywhere. But it needs to be challenged. I
don't understand, nor support, any of this female equality thing
currently going on here. But I do admit that there is something not
reasonable, something in which male played a dominant voice and coined
a mold for the females without asking of their opinions. And this
one-sided initiative is the one I'm becoming aware of, and I think it
is wrong.&lt;/p&gt;</content><category term="thoughts"></category><category term="thoughts"></category></entry><entry><title>Independent Documentaries</title><link href="https://fengxia41103.github.io/myblog/independent%20documentaries.html" rel="alternate"></link><published>2021-04-18T22:43:00-04:00</published><updated>2021-04-18T22:43:00-04:00</updated><author><name>Feng Xia</name></author><id>tag:fengxia41103.github.io,2021-04-18:/myblog/independent documentaries.html</id><summary type="html">&lt;figure class="col s12"&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Out of nowhere, I ended up watching three Chinese independent
documentaries. I don't know why. Started the first one only because I
was a bit tired of reading books today and wanted for a change. Then,
&lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7TjhUdpJcOg"&gt;one&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y60DETlQLs8"&gt;two&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lVvx5TYVS6Q"&gt;three&lt;/a&gt;... I don't know what to think. The
strange feeling is that, I was initially touched, or disturbed, but
towards the end, I was a bit, calm? numb?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;No, don't get me wrong. I think all three are excellent movies. I like
the reality feeling of them, real people, real environment, real
life. I felt the stress, the struggle, the yearn to live and to
prosper, the familiar yet foreign settings of Beijing, of the
peripheral vicinity of the city that was as rural and dirty and
chaotic as I could understand, could picture myself setting foot on,
and have ever been. I don't know what to make out of them. I
understand all the words, but they all are stories of another planet,
another life, that has no similarity to mine, but I don't feel pushed …&lt;/p&gt;</summary><content type="html">&lt;figure class="col s12"&gt;

and have ever been. I don't know what to make out of them. I
understand all the words, but they all are stories of another planet,
another life, that has no similarity to mine, but I don't feel pushed
away. Watching their houses, the young kids at Noah's age, their
parents of my age, what they do, what they eat, how they feel, keeps
me make me think of the four levels in the &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/Factfulness-Reasons-World-Things-Better/dp/1250123828/ref=sr_1_1?dchild=1&amp;amp;keywords=factfulness&amp;amp;qid=1618800611&amp;amp;sr=8-1"&gt;Factfulness&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;strong&gt;Where am
I? and where are they?&lt;/strong&gt; I know mine is level 4 according to the book,
and probably an above average of level 4. Is theirs level 3? 2? Is
such one level of difference so, alien!? I don't know, but what got me
to write right now is a feeling that, theirs, are not that different
from mine. Not anymore.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It used to be that I feel I'm living in parallel universe from
theirs. Not only I have no chance to taste their life, I have no
desire to do that, either. Over all my life I had thought myself being
so higher above their life in every aspect that I didn't even feel
there is any necessity to recognize their existence. Yet, now at this
age, not that my life is miserable, well, yet it is, in its own way,
but I don't feel ours are miles apart anymore. Yes they are still
quite different, but no, they are quite the same life, the same agony,
same stress, same hope, same how to make a living, same how to feed
the kids, same how to make some money and get a better life, and same
trying to be recognized by peers, within a circle, grouped w/ friends
and family, admitted by like minds, and sneaked small funs here and
there so the life is colorful, and even cheerful....&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The book by Ji Xianlin, &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/Cowshed-Memories-Chinese-Cultural-Revolution/dp/1590179269/ref=sr_1_fkmr1_2?dchild=1&amp;amp;keywords=cowshed+jixianlin&amp;amp;qid=1618801032&amp;amp;sr=8-2-fkmr1"&gt;Cowshed&lt;/a&gt;, gave me the same feeling
today. Such a remote experience, the Cultural Revolution, the Cowshed,
Beijing... I knew little of all these. Yet, his stories, whether
fictional or not, echoed.. no it's not because I wanted to connect w/
the author. I have no feeling of him one way or another. Except his
name I know nothing of his work, nor his reputation. His name is well
known, but I don't even know why so. Yet, walking w/ him through his
journey of those years, he called his heart a mirror of the time, and
each episode of his struggle days, he summarized an image reflected by
his &lt;em&gt;mirror&lt;/em&gt;, and that particular analogy, I can't agree more.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yes. In the last few months I started to feel more and more aware of
what my mind is going through in an experience. Starting w/ that stock
tool, I recognized exactly why I took a fancy of this question, what I
tried, what were the hurdles, and how I felt.. these, footsteps of the
mind, of the heart, became ever more standing out, than before. Why!?
Aging? that my mind is slowing down, thus allowing me to catch a
glimpse of it now, when it used to race like a rocket? That wouldn't
be good. But I would rather think it is because I started to be more
sensitive and clear-minded to such things now. Like a kid who would be
so absorbed by a butterfly that all the rest of the world could have
just disappeared without him know. I used to be a kid's mind. But now,
I'm a grown up... how funny, and how sad, at age 48, I'm finally a
grown up!?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;These people in the films, even out of their heavy accents I could
feel it, that I know what's going through him mind, and the same
thought, same reasoning, have been in mine, also. Even more than this,
his reasoning is loud, clear, practical, and a good one.. really, I
couldn't do any better than he has done if I were in his
shoes. Period. These people, these, used to be nearly illiterate in my
mind, have performed extraordinarily well, in this same exam we are
in, called, living a life.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I can't say I admire them. No I don't. I still know well that many
thing I know how to, they don't. But this same statement is now mutual
&amp;mdash; many things they do w/ ease, I don't know where to start. I
don't feel they could ever be as good an engineer as I am if were
given a chance. But I highly doubt myself being as good as they are,
either, if given the swap. I think in the end of day, the root cause
of my feeling is a loss of self-confidence. Perhaps.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Bravery. Courage. I used to think I have plenty of them. I have stood
up to things I didn't like. I have stood up for strangers to protect
them. I have stood up to friends for her causes. But with aging,
watching yourself become weaker, uglier, less attractive, less
competitive, less polished, less, everything, takes courage, calls for
bravery, and a lot, a lot of them.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I start to understand mom's choice of insisting living alone. I start
to admire her courage of watching herself and dad going into not just
age, but loss. Yes, she is a hero, indeed, even though I still hold a
grudge against her, I think she is one brave soul, and I could only
wish I would have her endurance and strength, to face the
deterioration, to face the sunset of a life, to face the inevitable of
being lonely, being forgotten, being miserable, being ill, being in
pain, being pushed around, but still stand up straight, and be
alright.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That's what these films have, bravery, courage, a fire to live and to
prosper, an energy, that I admire. Bravo for these film makers! I'll
try.&lt;/p&gt;</content><category term="thoughts"></category><category term="thoughts"></category></entry><entry><title>Why read books</title><link href="https://fengxia41103.github.io/myblog/why%20read%20books.html" rel="alternate"></link><published>2021-04-05T10:32:00-04:00</published><updated>2021-04-05T10:32:00-04:00</updated><author><name>Feng Xia</name></author><id>tag:fengxia41103.github.io,2021-04-05:/myblog/why read books.html</id><summary type="html">&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"If you only read the books that everyone else is reading, you can
only think what everyone else is thinking."  - (via
dryyoureyes-startbelieving) (via katetbk)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On my way out this morning to jog, I suddenly realized why I started
to read more and more books. The backdrop is that I have been watching
this prime video called &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/Couples-Therapy-Season-1/dp/B07XB7XNLJ"&gt;Couple Therapy&lt;/a&gt;. It's a reality show that
four couples showing up in a psychiatrist's office, talked about their
relationships, struggles, feelings, and all that. Boy, isn't being
together hard!? Yes it is! And this exact conclusion was going through
my mind, not only while I was watching the show, but when this morning
I was going downstairs to jog. Suddenly I started to realize why I'm
reading more and more books these years.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The common cliche, of course, are two. First, you start to be

&lt;p&gt;On my way out this morning to jog, I suddenly realized why I started

reading more and more books these years.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The common cliche, of course, are two. First, you start to be
interested in, say, history, and with aging, you have more life
experience, thus can understand better the complexity of historical
event &amp;rarr; more interesting now to read them, and to appreciate the
intricacy of the time, the characters. Second, you have a stronger
urge than when you were younger to have something, knowledge in this
particular discussion, to impress your audience. You can label it
vanity, middle age crisis, insecurity, and the like.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But my question is, why? Why so? I think there are underline currents
that actually is driving the two. The first one is easy to understand
because it's much to the fact &amp;mdash; you do gain more experience,
whether you like it or not, that you can relate what happened back
then more and more to what you had experienced, thus you often even in
the shoe of the character in the story, and you would inevitably form
an opinion based on what you would have done, have thought, have felt,
if you were there, were him/her, and all these brought the story
closer to you, almost making them personal. When you were young, you
might have an imagination of being so-and-so while reading a book, or
watching a movie. However, regardless how you have identified w/ your
hero, all heroes are more or less the same to you as a kid, because
they are all external &amp;larr; your admiration, or willingness to become
them, is not based on how much you two were alike. On the contrary, it
was based on the exact the opposite &amp;mdash; what they have, you don't
have them, be it a super power, a way to fly, or the cool gesture.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Once you aged, this round of being close to the character again is
different. Instead of being rooted in the difference, it is now
founded on overlaps &amp;mdash; empathy. You feel the pain, feel the
panic, feel the hopeless agony, and all these speak an underline theme
which, like a ghost, has been hovering over your head all along, you
fear it, but don't know what to do w/ it &amp;mdash; &lt;strong&gt;all these in the
book isn't far from you&lt;/strong&gt;. They are pretty real, to the point that you
can picture yourself going through them, not because of an
imagination, but because of the slow progress mankind has been
making.. oh boy, isn't it too slow sometimes!? Reading Dicken's may
sound really remote to us living in Chapel Hill these days, the child
labor, the mills, Oliver Twist, orphanage, but here it is, in the
headline news, you see it happening right in front of your eyes,
somewhere on this planet, there is an Oliver Twist, living the exact
poor condition, going through the exact same life journey, and many
times theirs are even worse than the book. This makes history not an
external fantasy anymore, but another version of the reality &amp;mdash;
we can call Oliver the British version of the same child labor abuse,
while the news of those poor country or the ones trying to escape to
America across the border, the Mexican version, and all these
versions, have the same story line. And that, makes the click.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Regarding the second point, I used to think it's more driven by
vanity, you know, the eagerness to brag in front of your friends and
dinner table guests. But then, putting aside the possibility that
there are people who are just vain, born to be a bragger, it still
leaves the question of why many, when they are getting older, are
motivated to read? I admit there is a voice on the back of my mind
when I read a book, that I could picture speaking certain lines to
achieve some admiration stares. But that alone isn't enough to explain
the drive. If being able to repeat author's opinion as if it were mine
is the primary goal, well, unless you have a good memory, the only
alternative would be to study and take notes, treating these
books/lines as that English word you were to repeat thousands of times
in high school. But I'm not doing that. So out of all the books I
read, less than 10%, well, I would dare to say, less than 1%, left any
impression on my mind &amp;mdash; I couldn't recall what the author said,
what the arguments were, any particular line I could quote, or even
where it is on my bookshelf! The all likely destiny of them is that I
only remember I read them, and with a high probability I never
finished them! Sad, isn't it? So, doesn't this then make my reading
these books a vain exercise? I think it does based on these,
symptoms. But, I think there are more.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;First, loneliness. I keenly feel the older you are, the lonelier one
becomes. Not only you have less and less time to social, but you are
more and more living in a setting that are segregated from others. For
a large chunk of your younger years, you are immersed in a group
environment, schools, clubs, and on. All these, on the one hand,
downplayed your individual identity, as you being always identified as
part of a team of some sort, thus the team's identity is the &lt;em&gt;super&lt;/em&gt;
set of yours. On the other hand, it &lt;strong&gt;forces social interactions&lt;/strong&gt;
which is the necessary starting point of making friends, knowing
somebody, meeting someone, and falling love. Therefore, it felts quite
natural and effortless back then that you were hardly alone.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But that is not the case once you grow up. Once you step out of
school, you start to gain more on the individual level, but lose on
the group end. Your family, your house, your this, your that... all of
these, are identifying, and emphasizing, you, as an individual, and is
separating you from a group. So back to the book topic. We all know
reading a book is like conversing w/ the author. Here it is. When you
don't have someone to speak to, but the social necessity still exists,
&lt;strong&gt;reading book is a replacement to socialization&lt;/strong&gt;! Therefore, these
books are like, a pet, or prostitute, that they come to you whenever
at your will, and will go away whenever you dismiss them, no
responsibility on your end to make them happy, but they server you
100% wholeheartedly! What a selfish picture I am painting! But that's
exact so, isn't it? So I guess at the end of day, a person is selfish,
and that trait must manifest somehow. If it were not manifested as a
nasty boss, or a criminal, then it will manifest itself in a cloak of
reading a book, as if civilized, high cultural, and respectful, but is
really the same deal.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now switching gear to another point. I think the older one is, the
keener one realizes too many things in life are out of his/her
control. When little, we thought parents are our backbones, and their
house would stand behind us forever, then untill one day you realize
they have grown old and weak, and their house needs your repair,
instead of being your invincible castle. Then, marriage, this couple
therapy, is revealing that an intimate relationship grown out of
intense love may not be robust, either, and they often collapse in the
end. So all these would make you realize the only thing you could rely
on is yourself. Thus, reading a book, giving yourself knowledge, or
new sensation, or whatever, as long as the object is yourself, is more
reliable than putting yourself out there hoping to be supported by
someone else. So even reading book is always linked to educational
value, the true comfort isn't the value of knowledge, but a
realization that you are on your own. This, of course, is tied to the
previous point of loneliness. This is the 2nd face of the same coin,
if you will &amp;mdash; I'm lonely, I feel no support by others, thus, I
fall back on myself, and reading book is my method.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So, books, as long as a human is going through the life journey as I
have described above, are really a loyal companion, a safety net, that
save you from falling apart completely. It's not a tool to improve
yourself, well, it may be the outcome, but rather unintentionally, but
a life boat saving you from drowning by the life's misery.&lt;/p&gt;</content><category term="thoughts"></category></entry><entry><title>Asian Hate</title><link href="https://fengxia41103.github.io/myblog/asian%20hate.html" rel="alternate"></link><published>2021-03-29T09:12:00-04:00</published><updated>2021-03-29T09:12:00-04:00</updated><author><name>Feng Xia</name></author><id>tag:fengxia41103.github.io,2021-03-29:/myblog/asian hate.html</id><summary type="html">&lt;figure class="col l6 m6 s12"&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This, is a genie in a bottle &amp;mdash; the entire hatred now felt by the
society and occupying the headline news and congress's attention. The
world paid dearly for putting it back, putting aside the actual
justice each side claimed to be. Yet, Trump disturbed the hornet's
nest, and viola, now it's out again. This is really sad, sad times. I
need to read Dickens' &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hard_Times_(novel)"&gt;Hard Times&lt;/a&gt;, maybe I'll learn a thing or two
in this parallel.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Noah's spring vacation.  It's super peaceful and quiet when he is not

like gears being twisted and turned and driven by some other larger
gears. Weather is nice, and my new guitar string worked out
wonderfully. That, makes me really happy.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I firmly believe that the human language, being as it is, is, if not

accomplice. I think the thought of discrimination is built-in, more

&lt;p&gt;I firmly believe that the human language, being as it is, is, if not
the root cause of all these hatred and evil, is definitely an
accomplice. I think the thought of discrimination is built-in, more
native than language, because, after all, language is something you
learn w/ an effort, is a skill you acquire after you are born. But the
whole tendency of not wanting others to board the bus once you are on,
you are born with it, coming from as core as a DNA. Called it whatever
it is, selfishness, limitation, discrimination,
unfairness... whatever, really, see, this is exactly the problem I'm
saying, that the human language, at least the ones I know of (which
are only two, but representative at least, English being spoken by 70%
of the earth population), that you can't really come up a, &lt;strong&gt;term&lt;/strong&gt;,
to describe this, thing, that you want to describe! This is crazy,
isn't it?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In my line of work, I have been constantly struggling with vague
definitions, terms which I call &lt;a href="https://fengxia41103.github.io/myblog/can you innovate.html"&gt;buzz words&lt;/a&gt;. But with growing old
and having more thoughts to this, what I would call, annoyance, I
start to realize this is everywhere, literally, everywhere. This is
not beyond being annoyance anymore. This is pure disaster because it
feels like a Truman's world, that you live inside it without having a
way to get out, and many others you live with don't even realize this
problem &amp;larr; they genuinely believe the blue sky they see is real,
as that they firmly believe the buzz word they are using has a
definition. No, they are not! They are abstract, general, and could be
anything and nothing. They, in the end, don't define themselves, but
at the mercy of its interpreter. But we treat them as if they have a
soul, are independent, objective, stand on its own. It is this
illusion which makes this entire hatred wave terrible.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I have long been criticizing the term, &lt;em&gt;the people&lt;/em&gt;, which you find
prolific among politician addresses. I would much prefer that they
were more specific in their talks, don't tell me what you will do for
the people, but tell me what you are going to do to solve my problem,
say, to fix my porch screen. But I understand as a mayor, a president,
they inevitably have to use a general term, thus the people seems
convenient and, correct. But, if top down has no choice but to be
abstract and vague, I'm totally alarmed by the &lt;strong&gt;people&lt;/strong&gt; who are
talking and addressing from bottom up are also using the same
language, same concept &amp;larr; avoiding details, but elevating their
agenda and message using the word such as fight for Asian, fight for
the Black people, or unite the Minority, that kind of thing. I mean,
just take a step back, Asia, is a continent, there are a lot of people
living their, they are all categorized as Asian. However, I know for
sure Korean don't put them in the same camp w/ Chinese, Japanese don't
agree w/ remarks if they were for China, North Korean probably don't
agree with any of the Asian population, and Malay? Indosian? Indian?
Thai?.... the list can go on and on and on and on... so my point is,
&lt;strong&gt;there isn't an Asian&lt;/strong&gt;! There isn't such a thing as Asian. There is
a group identity that billions share. Therefore, speaking of Asian
hate and Asian protection are, in my opinion, equally false. You can
attack an individual who fits your profile of an Asian (hair, skin
color, glasses), but fundamentally you simply don't know. Therefore,
such an attack, or hate, isn't even targeting Asian &amp;mdash; it's just
hate, a feeling that could turn on anyone, anything, without being
bothered whether the victim is Asian or not. In other words, what
Trump released isn't a prejudice against Asian, but hate and anger
that have kept put in this society. Asian is the new victim, just as
Jews were the old ones. Do this, swapping the word "Asian" out, and
replacing it with any other noun you can think of, it doesn't make it
right, either, and it doesn't change the nature of such act at
all. Therefore, it is this uprising violence we condemn, and no one is
immune once violence becomes acceptable.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The whole &lt;a href="https://fengxia41103.github.io/myblog/capitol riot.html"&gt;capital riot&lt;/a&gt; trial was disappointing to me, because it
was so determined by a political view, but lost the view of condemning
violence. If a violence at such a scale could be pardoned, well, what
else can not be!? Arguing about who is right or wrong using motivation
as defense is pointless. I have to agree w/ Russel that &lt;a href="https://users.drew.edu/~jlenz/whynot.html"&gt;"Fear is the
parent of cruelty"&lt;/a&gt;. Yes, violence, hate, attack, are all faces of
the same evil, fear. It is fear that now circulating in this air.&lt;/p&gt;</content><category term="thoughts"></category></entry><entry><title>Impeachment</title><link href="https://fengxia41103.github.io/myblog/impeachment.html" rel="alternate"></link><published>2021-02-14T10:46:00-05:00</published><updated>2021-02-14T10:46:00-05:00</updated><author><name>Feng Xia</name></author><id>tag:fengxia41103.github.io,2021-02-14:/myblog/impeachment.html</id><summary type="html">&lt;figure class="col s12"&gt;
  &lt;img src="images/mitch.jpg"/&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I have to say, this is very disappointing. Listening to the calls of these senators to say guilty or not guilty, was very disheartening, when so many say not guilty. This was very puzzling to me. I mean, what would you do when there were somebody pointed a gun at your head? And isn't this capitol hill building like their home? So? We ordinary people were all taught that if someone invaded your private property, you can just fire and shoot. But here, their home was invaded by these mobs, and yet, they played so called politics! I don't understand, really, &lt;strong&gt;what is going on&lt;/strong&gt;!?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When I was young, I learned that those so called 世纪审判 by Soviet were all staged. I remember reading them in a book from my college library, and it was quite a shocker to me. I had little life experience then, and nothing of my own opinion on this subject. But over the years I have always believed that such trials won't happen in America. Not that …&lt;/p&gt;</summary><content type="html">&lt;figure class="col s12"&gt;

I had little life experience then, and nothing of my own opinion on this subject. But over the years I have always believed that such trials won't happen in America. Not that I believe politics are better there. But I have an ultimate faith in the legal system of what America stands for, that a person is assumed innocent until proven guilty, and all accusations are based on evidence, not behind-the-door deal makings. But this, is a slap in the face. I especially couldn't understand Mitch McConnel's speech after he voted not guilty. Why acquitting him then!? And impeaching him doesn't block him from being sued for criminal charges, either, right!? It's irrelevant whether there is a better mean to judge him or punish him, it's your stand that matters here. It's the same that you stand up for a bully at the moment you catch him doing the wrongs &amp;mdash; yes there is police and all that who can punish him better. But hey, you should just stand up to the bully at that time, and say, "stop"! because that's what a decent citizen, human being, should do!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I don't understand this. I think the real damage isn't only this
demonstration of cowardice, but now they are sending a confusing
message to the public. When a person doesn't behave consistently,
everything becomes a crying wolf, and it makes it difficult then to
know when there is a real wolf. I thought this was exactly the
argument by Hayak in his &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Road_to_Serfdom"&gt;The Road to Serfdom&lt;/a&gt;, that a planning
economy distorted the message conveyed by price, thus making people
not trusting the market anymore, which then spills over to all aspects
of society because, once your inner compass was disturbed, you lose a
reference to tell true from false. I think this is exactly what
happened yesterday when he was acquitted.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is even more difficult for a dad when I'm raising my son and
battling his habit of saying a lie so to get out of a trouble. This is
a human nature, the first defense you use when you are caught. And I
think the entire education is about curbing this nature, so that you
will be honest even when things are not in favor to yourself, you
admit your acts, apologize, and try to fix it. That's what I preached
to Noah, that's what I thought everyone should be doing, that's what
an adult was told to be. These senators are supposed to be an example
&lt;strong&gt;because they represent ideas, and an idea is what America is all
about!&lt;/strong&gt; So when they fail, they didn't fail as an individual, but
failed as an idea, and when America doesn't have the idea anymore, how
is it then different from any other country in which people are
suffering because of their government or even their dictators!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is just, wrong.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I don't know. This is a dark time, really, I think, that is comparable
to what I heard of the 1930s when Hitler was rising. Condolence of 1/6
is like condoning invasion of Poland &amp;mdash; that was a calculated act
that all the Allies thought were a deal. Yet, the world ended up
paying millions of lives for this.  When a mistake like such was made,
no one was going to win.. well, Stalin won, but hey, who is to use his
example to justify a deed, any deed? He was the lowest of the lows,
wasn't he!? These senators thinking they could still retreat w/ their
loots were simply defying history lessons! If you want to be nasty and
benefit yourself!?  well, what Mr.Kim's family has been doing is
actually the correct version &amp;mdash; doing the wrong consistently,
blatantly, publicly, shamelessly, relentlessly, and thoroughly. So was
Hitler. He said what he did, and he never swayed from his idea, no
inconsistency whatsoever. I don't like any of these fanatics. But they
are at least predictable, and thus stoppable.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It's these opportunists, who always put their benefits ahead of any,
are, like an elusive bug &amp;larr; if you can't reproduce them, how do
you then analyze them and come up a fix!?&lt;/p&gt;</content><category term="thoughts"></category><category term="thoughts"></category></entry><entry><title>GameStop</title><link href="https://fengxia41103.github.io/myblog/gamestop.html" rel="alternate"></link><published>2021-01-28T14:19:00-05:00</published><updated>2021-01-28T14:19:00-05:00</updated><author><name>Feng Xia</name></author><id>tag:fengxia41103.github.io,2021-01-28:/myblog/gamestop.html</id><summary type="html">&lt;figure class="col s12"&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This, is absolutely, entertaining! Wow, I have to believe that
somewhere out there there is a voice that is directing me to these
things, really. I don't watch the market usually, if at all, then,
open to read the news yesterday, and it was the frenzy of GameStop and
AMC all over the news! Of course there are plenty China readers
reaction as well. So, what to make of it!?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;China posts usually put this as a revolution so that common people
uprising against the big capitalist, the Wall Street. Well, it's
exciting thinking that way, but it's only what the surface looks
like. I don't buy this story, well, I should say, I totally buy what
the news said about the &lt;a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/"&gt;Reddit wallstreetbets&lt;/a&gt; where this whole
thing might have started from. But the implication, imho, is far more
than an uprising. So, this is another predict-to-the-future
episode. Let me try, maybe I do have a crystal ~~&lt;/p&gt;

episode. Let me try, maybe I do have a crystal ~~&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;First of all, learned in MBA class that stock market is pretty small
comparing to the bond market. I think it's just a commoner's fallacy
that wall street traders all watching the stock market going up and
down as we, or the 菜场大妈， do. Far from it, even though I'm just
another outside. They don't watch market as we do, and if anything,
big decisions are unlikely made on the spot by any human &amp;mdash; there
is gotta be process, and likely automation. It's a loaded cannon, for
God's sake, that it may react quickly if a human commander can just
pull the trigger, but hey, days like yesterday's are few in a whole
year, but a loaded canon can misfire a LOT if relying on a human. So,
regardless how popular the image of these traders are in movies, I
firmly believe Wall Street lives off discipline and likely strict
automation &amp;rarr; I'm not even talking about automation of data
crunch, backtesting, big data analysis, AI, those craps. It's codified
knowledge, strategy, experience, trial-and-error, policy, protection,
the core of what they know and what they do. Therefore, the uprising,
if we call it so, isn't really causing some panic traders running
around. Rather, it's a puzzling act, I bet, that they start to get
notifications of some strategy conditions have been met, but
unexpected, like me stepping on a bug, you know, you stare at the
screen, and all you will be saying is, "WTF", and hardly much you can
do even if you know exactly which line of code to change, because the
change has to go through a line of processes before it be stamped as
&lt;em&gt;production ready&lt;/em&gt;. So, I think, is what the Wall Street, was like
yesterday.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now, move on to what this episode means in the future? The easiest
answer tossed around is that revolution is here, 颤抖吧资本家. Really?
In my opinion, no. Capitalist isn't going to shake to death at
all. Again, using my bug analogy, it's definitely annoying, but not a
killer, even the BSOD isn't bad enough to scare you off your pants, is
it!? Just some terrible oversight allowed this to happen, and always
always always, a human error, not the machine's. So, we can safely
dismiss the idea that now all shorts are going to leave the arena
because, hey, who dares to counter so called &lt;em&gt;the people&lt;/em&gt;!? But,
regardless how they raid, yes, raid, this is exactly like those
normads raiding some town back in the days &amp;mdash; they brought fear,
death, and walk away w/ loots, but at the end of the day, it's hardly
a profitable model, let alone sustainable. There are many factors come
to play, which I can predict, will collapse this brotherhood high even
though it feels so good. No, this isn't some conspiracy theory, but by
my observation and thinkings of human behavior in similar settings.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;First, there will be split of opinion on whom to loot. If not amassing
enough force, raid will not work. The first couple raids are easy to
pull off because few has too much opinion yet on a new thing &amp;mdash;
let's try it. Once the POC is done, all of sudden, many more realize
this is a feasible path (to make $$), thus each start to chip in their
personality and opinion, which then lead down to, not business, but
politics. And to my observation, once a loosely organized community
start to battle different opinions, it will be strained because of the
high tension, and that pushes away many, thus it hurts the community
becomes large. The alternative, however, is the party, or the church,
like things, that have rules, priests, punishments, and all these
things are totally not what people joining such community wanted to
have at the first place! So they will find them propelling an org
which they themselves dislike, morally. So even making good money, the
conscience isn't as wonderful as it feels yesterday &amp;mdash; yesterday,
it felt they did &lt;strong&gt;the right thing&lt;/strong&gt;, but eventually, it becomes a
tradeoff between moral and profit, well, then how different it is then
from the Street they hate!?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Second, I don't like this mob actions at all. Again, it is super
entertaining. But it's scary. Not that they have a guy big enough to
blow anybody. Not yet. But they definitely have a gun that hurts. Now
the question is, are they a responsible/sane/decent guy owner!? Well,
this is a fuzzy question. Whose moral standard we go by with? And even
we could challenge, does it matter? If we consider the capitalist has
the origin of sin, then it justifies the action, right? Well, then, is
the assumption, correct? By the Trump years we can already see the
magnified mob voice everywhere, US, China, everywhere! Lies, truth,
facts, who-knows-what, are flying all over the place. Internet is a
free highway, and a lot of folks are behaving like a highway robbers,
too. So, if January we were still debating Trump's tweeter
account. Now all of sudden the Netcizens showed that other aspects of
life can be as vulnerable as the politics if applying the Internet
way. If a platform can sway voters to elect a Trump, then it is
certainly perceivable the same method can be applied to a stock, a
company, of course, a human being. If we used to consider online
bullies are just minorities of some teenager incidents, we now see the
same spirit, I should say, sentiment, is now spilling out of that
playground, and is now stretching its paws onto something we thought
pretty out of reach &amp;mdash; well, it apparent is not, anymore.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Third, just saw a news that creditors of AMC just got off the hook
because now AMC can issue more stocks, raise money, then pay off these
creditors. For a losing business, creditors are betting the high
interest w/ that company not going to bankrupt. Well, now I bet they
start to realize there is another strategy &amp;mdash; buy some online
power, get the sentiments to support his client, then bail out! Wow,
now, these people are very different from the people &amp;mdash; they are
bankers, they have money, they have incentive, and yesterday, the
people just demo-ed a POC! Wow, I think this is the real implication
going forward. The big money is now going to come into the Internet
shouting game, hire some big mega phone, and arouse some
sentiments.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This, is not going to be pretty.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There is still one more question I don't know the answer yet &amp;mdash; again, it's easy to perceive such strategy, but it's hard to pull it off. So, w/ all the strangers on a forum, why and how they can act in union? This, is actually quite amazing. Reminds me the news of 鹿晗 fans organized to get some exact number of blesses, something like exactly 10^8, no more, no less, on his birthday. It does then seem possible this can happen, if not sending a bless, but in yesterday's case, money.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Hmm... I like the name, GameStop, yeah, indeed, some old games are
being stopped, and new players and new ways are here.&lt;/p&gt;</content><category term="thoughts"></category><category term="thoughts"></category></entry><entry><title>Attention</title><link href="https://fengxia41103.github.io/myblog/attention.html" rel="alternate"></link><published>2021-01-24T10:25:00-05:00</published><updated>2021-01-24T10:25:00-05:00</updated><author><name>Feng Xia</name></author><id>tag:fengxia41103.github.io,2021-01-24:/myblog/attention.html</id><summary type="html">&lt;figure class="col l6 m12 s12"&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is a curious thing. By sort of a pure accident, I haven't been
looking at the 朋友圈 for a while. I don't even know how long it has
been, weeks? Not a whole month I'm sure. But here is a thought just
occurred to me &amp;mdash; during this period, there are many of my
&lt;em&gt;friends&lt;/em&gt; whom I now know nothing about. I mean, I don't what they

got their &lt;strong&gt;news&lt;/strong&gt; from the &lt;em&gt;broadcast&lt;/em&gt;. Almost like a personal radio
station that you need to tune in in order to listen. Well, the flip
side is also true &amp;mdash; if you want to shut them off, just don't
tune in.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This makes me wonder why so and what it means!? It used to be that I
thought the people 做 when they don't reveal their thoughts but making
you to guess. As a matter of fact, this is a common conversation I
have w/ Noah these days, that unless he can voice his …&lt;/p&gt;</summary><content type="html">&lt;figure class="col l6 m12 s12"&gt;
  &lt;img src="images/IMG_20210123_175332.jpg"/&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is a curious thing. By sort of a pure accident, I haven't been
looking at the 朋友圈 for a while. I don't even know how long it has
been, weeks? Not a whole month I'm sure. But here is a thought just
occurred to me &amp;mdash; during this period, there are many of my
&lt;em&gt;friends&lt;/em&gt; whom I now know nothing about. I mean, I don't what they
did, or said, or thought, nothing &amp;larr; because it used to be that I
got their &lt;strong&gt;news&lt;/strong&gt; from the &lt;em&gt;broadcast&lt;/em&gt;. Almost like a personal radio
station that you need to tune in in order to listen. Well, the flip
side is also true &amp;mdash; if you want to shut them off, just don't
tune in.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This makes me wonder why so and what it means!? It used to be that I
thought the people 做 when they don't reveal their thoughts but making
you to guess. As a matter of fact, this is a common conversation I
have w/ Noah these days, that unless he can voice his idea and want,
I'm not a mind reader. So this same cliche goes w/ many sad love
stories when the two stop communication, usually by the girl first,
that the poor guy &lt;em&gt;has to guess&lt;/em&gt; what she wants, that's when the
relationship went haywire, in my opinion anyway. But now, w/ this 朋友
圈 thing, I wonder whether it is yet another &lt;strong&gt;human weakness&lt;/strong&gt; that
everyone, I do mean everyone, is hunger for &lt;strong&gt;passive
attention&lt;/strong&gt;. That's right. Instead of asking for attention which we
were told and educated to be a bad behavior, yet we want attention,
want to be in the spotlight. Thus, we take the approach of actively
broadcasting (I call it broadcasting because it, at least, pretends
that it's oblivious to audiences, "Look I'm talking whether there is
someone listening or not"), yet our satisfaction is when the other
person &lt;em&gt;tune in by their choice&lt;/em&gt;! So in this sense, we are just
playing a victim role that I'm innocent, I don't want to behave badly
(eg. asking for attention, in this case), well, since you tuned in,
first of all, if there were fault, it's yours; second, I get the
recognition, even falsely, that my message must be good!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Hmm, interesting. So it's even about attention, now to think of
it. It's really about fundamentally two things, which both I found in
Noah, therefore it must be a built-in human traits, not unique to
anyone, but universally true to everyone &amp;mdash; fear to take
responsibility, and eager for comradeship. The first point, I feel, is
a bit exaggerated. I don't think the word "responsibility" is
accurate. I mean, by being passive doesn't really mean being
irresponsible. Just to think of the alternatives. What? Shovel your
ideas down to someone's throat? That's not pleasant either. So it's
better to be in the passive mode &amp;rarr; waiting for others to
discover. But, this reminds a conversation I had w/ my roommate years
back, that his idea of life is to announce his virtue in loud speaker,
not necessarily to magnify it in a loud speaker, but at least not to
bury it in a sand; mine was the burying it in a sand, but hoping the
diamond, by being a true diamond, will shine through, maybe taking
time, but it will, right? Well, that was 22 years ago. Now at this
age, I'm not so sure that a diamond will eventually shine through. I
guess I'm still considering myself as a diamond, which may not be
justified, but nonetheless, I haven't yet given up hope that this idea
of life is worth my time.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So back to this broadcasting mode. It isn't that people shun from
responsibility by not making a direct message to you. Well, in a way,
yes. By not speaking directly, say, face to face, even virtually, it
does take away the responsibility of your remarks! But let's not be
too strict on this. It's not ideal broadcasting, but it's not a crime,
either. But the second point, the comradeship one, isn't it the same
as the cliche that 人类是群居动物？ Even if I take this point, what
that means? It sounds obvious that we, from the animal phase of human
history, huddle together for safety and survival. So such trait
continuously dictate our life. Is it so?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When I was speaking to Noah on similar things, I used to think that
it's about self-confidence, or in adult's term, independent thinking,
that you are confident and have a willingness to make a conclusion and
judgment of your own regardless the popular sentiments (well, even in
this sense, what's the boundary between independent thinking and being
just arrogant!? Don't those BS policy makers, such as the recent 返乡
one, pretty &lt;em&gt;independent&lt;/em&gt; in this sense that s/he didn't care a whim
of what the public's daily life would be like w/ this BS idea!? But we
won't value their independent effort, do we?) So, if we can't really
draw a clear line between them, wouldn't it be a bad idea to solicit
2nd opinion, in this case, seeking recognition, seeking agreement,
seeking nods, from someone else, like-minded, so to confirm that my
idea isn't off the track, that it has merits, and it's a good one,
just like myself has thought so!? Isn't it nothing but natural!? Or
even, necessary!? Don't all dictators all make decisions without
listening to others, so that they had full, maybe too full, of an
independent thinking, while lacking agreements? Therefore, it feels
not a bad idea at all to post 朋友圈， as it's not a mode of 做 at
all, but a good strategy to follow, so that you won't become more and
more, arrogant and narrow minded.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Hmm... But here is another wrinkle to this. When everybody is radioing
his/her voice, not only the like-minded will be able to find each
other, thus forming so called &lt;em&gt;interest group&lt;/em&gt;, but it always implies
a &lt;strong&gt;one-way&lt;/strong&gt; communication &amp;mdash; as mentioned earlier, it's a one
way from them to my ear, &lt;em&gt;I'm broadcasting sth whether you listen or
not&lt;/em&gt;, and me the audience can turn you off without ever telling or
saying why.  Therefore, the entire communication in this mode is
always, lacking a feedback loop.  If so, it means the system is not
stable, and it's prone to oscillation leading to spin out of control,
in theory! In a face to face talk, the feedback is the other person's
face or hand, or the awkward silence in the air, thus speak always
means being sensitive to the other's reaction. Now being behind a
screen, such social media took away the feedback mechanism, well, it
didn't take away the feedback cause you can still see the comments, if
you will, but making it irrelevant if you choose not to respond! So
it's like making the feedback optional in a control system &amp;mdash; and
that's the difference, and the danger.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A bit detour to this social impact. So back to 朋友圈. What I was
really thinking was that who are still my friends? If s/he were my
true friend, wouldn't it be that s/he will talk to me, send me a
message, directly, instead of waiting for me to &lt;em&gt;monitor&lt;/em&gt; your life
through this radio? I would think so. I say Hi to my friends when I
miss them, I ask them how they are doing, want to connect w/ them. I
have things in life I want to share, want to know theirs, too. Mostly
importantly, being friends, it's a level of intimacy we share, more
than a radio set, right?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I think so.&lt;/p&gt;</content><category term="thoughts"></category></entry><entry><title>Winter evening</title><link href="https://fengxia41103.github.io/myblog/winter%20evening.html" rel="alternate"></link><published>2021-01-17T17:37:00-05:00</published><updated>2021-01-17T17:37:00-05:00</updated><author><name>Feng Xia</name></author><id>tag:fengxia41103.github.io,2021-01-17:/myblog/winter evening.html</id><summary type="html">&lt;figure class="col l6 m6 s12"&gt;

    Noah's Kumon arts... what can I say? It's rather funny to watch
    his arts, though he was distracted. But it's ok. He is doing well.
    &lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Another evening w/ beautiful sunset. It's has been the best decision
to live here, being able to look out the window and see such a
wonder. Noah is like my lucky star. Only with his instinct could we
have been so lucky. He's at mom's place today. Was thinking to join
him, but then was in the middle of getting netbox work the way I want,
so it became another evening just by myself.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The other day, Google photo prompted me a photo of Noah sitting on
horse back, and it was dated 2018, two years ago. Wow, I remember the
event, when he and I were visiting my dad, and we were invited for a
lunch in this fancy place by this rich son of my dad's neighbor. Both
his daughters and himself ride horses, and actually own horses. So for
the first time in his life, Noah got …&lt;/p&gt;</summary><content type="html">&lt;figure class="col l6 m6 s12"&gt;

his daughters and himself ride horses, and actually own horses. So for
the first time in his life, Noah got to sit on a horse. I told him
about the photo and how it makes me feel time flying by, and he said
he was actually scared at the moment because the horse looked HUGE. It
was, indeed, makes me wonder how soliders could have fought against
such a thing &amp;mdash; just imagine when it was running towards, and you
were like an ant comparing to its size. Courage, I guess, and perhaps,
desperation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Seeing that photo made me miss dad. I haven't been able to make the
yearly trip to see him due to Corvid. Unlikely this is be eased
anytime soon, even w/ vaccination. I can see him in Wechat group. He
is doing, as usual, but I dreamed about him quite often recently. I
don't feel anything is up yet. But it's an uneasy feeling.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A friend of mine shaved her head, like completely! Unbelievable!! and
it looks &lt;strong&gt;awesome&lt;/strong&gt; on her! It's really cool, I have to say,
especially when woman does it. I guess it has this &lt;em&gt;wow&lt;/em&gt; effect not
only because she does look pretty cool in it, but because it's
unexpected. Maybe I'll shave mine also someday, just to feel,
different, I guess, and it's rather a statement, of something. But
right now, I don't have anything so strong and dear to claim. So not
yet, not yet.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Her shave actually reminded me again that woman met in Shenzhen, 萍姐.
I actually don't know her name, so just going by the sound. She was
not only shaved, but wearing only T string, like all the time!!! It
was just, strange! Then you could see, that guys around her, though
pretending to show respect, always had an eye wondering around her ass
for a peek. Dark, isn't it!? I know. It was just a weird scene when
she was around. I don't know her story, why she was taking that
style. Had some chats w/ her. I think she was fine, somehow mellow
even, but maybe just for her own protection that she wanted to show
strength that way, I guess.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Picked up a line from 袁游 the other day, not by 袁sir himself, but
one of his substitute, and that line annoyed the hell out of me. It
goes like this, "As you know there are roughly two types of
civilization (actually I think he meant &lt;code&gt;culture&lt;/code&gt;, but here for
literal translation) &amp;mdash; west and east. East is represented by
mostly China and Japan, and you know Japanese culture came from China,
therefore..." Out of the mouth of some 20 year old, though
knowledgeable he is, is totally disgusting. I think this is now
passing the symptom of &lt;a href="https://fengxia41103.github.io/myblog/china nationalism.html"&gt;nationalism&lt;/a&gt;. This is outright arrogant and
self-centered. Not only there are more than West and East, but within
East there are more than just China and Japan! I haven't traveled as
much as I wish, but trips to Cambodia showed me clearly how wonderful
their past has been! It's an incredible sight seeing the Ankor Wat,
the beautiful carvings on the wall and stones, so beautifully done. It
was totally breathtaking. And honestly, please, stop always linking
Japan to China as if they are a son born without talent and is still
stupid &amp;mdash; this is as typical as some Chinese parents treating
their kids, that they think they will never grow up, never understand
much, and never good enough, &lt;em&gt;for the parents&lt;/em&gt;! Bullshit! Japan may
borrowed a lot from China, but they have not only preserved history
better, but have developed and built many wonderful things based on
the learning. It will be totally bizarre if Newton's first grade
teacher said that regardless Newton's achievement, he still owed all
his to the teacher.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;China has $$ to boast, but its mind is as inferior as days of Opium
war, unenlightened, and bogus.&lt;/p&gt;</content><category term="thoughts"></category><category term="thoughts"></category></entry><entry><title>知乎, 名词</title><link href="https://fengxia41103.github.io/myblog/capitol%20riot.html" rel="alternate"></link><published>2021-01-07T08:22:00-05:00</published><updated>2021-01-07T08:22:00-05:00</updated><author><name>Feng Xia</name></author><id>tag:fengxia41103.github.io,2021-01-07:/myblog/capitol riot.html</id><summary type="html">&lt;figure class="col s12"&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Watching the capitol riot was rather an exciting experience. But of
course, that's because I was hiding behind a screen, out of harm's
way, as if we are watching a war movie, sure, go for it guys, charge,
bring on the big guns and explosions and loud sound effect, whatever,
oh, where is my popcorn, honey!? But that's wrong, isn't it? or is it?
That's the dark side of a human, myself included, that lip service is
always wonderful and rewarding, and the bloodier it is, the more
arousing your senses become. What is this!? &lt;strong&gt;Gladiator mode!?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now, looking at comments on &lt;a href="https://www.zhihu.com/question/438235275"&gt;知乎&lt;/a&gt;, that is just totally
&lt;strong&gt;disgusting&lt;/strong&gt;! But I'm asking myself, why so? why I feel them
disgusting!? Is it just because I don't like Trump? or just to take a
stand of the event while myself really knows nothing about politics
nor these people inside the Capitol Hill? and why the word, &lt;em&gt;people&lt;/em&gt;?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1&gt;the people&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is interesting, because so many of 知乎 posts used the word, 人民，
the people. But I beg to disagree. First of all, what is &lt;em&gt;the people&lt;/em&gt;?
To the least, I would say that these men and women don't represent
me. So if they are the people, or representing the people, well, I
never agreed, nor agree now. But I do consider myself part of &lt;em&gt;the
people&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Well, so let's say we don't use the word &lt;em&gt;the people&lt;/em&gt;, then what!?
What do you use to describe these, people!? Yeah there are other words
used in th news, mobs, rioters, and so on and on, but again, someone
like me will also object their use because of so and so.. so I guess
the reality is, we have to pick a word to describe these, but no
single word will be satisfactory to all ears. Therefore, the momen an
even is being described, the opinions, which themselves are noting but
a version of description, thus also totally dependant on the words,
will be split. This is just a given! So the logic works like this:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;I use "A" to describe (my opinion)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;You use "B" to describe (your opinion)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Because we can't agree on using only A or B, we have split opinions.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So with this logic, the way to &lt;em&gt;unify opinions&lt;/em&gt; will be to &lt;em&gt;eliminate&lt;/em&gt;
A or B &amp;rarr; what is this then, censorship!? Dark logic, isn't this!?
So, can we then say that disagreement is really a built-in limitation
of human language!? &amp;larr; sounds so, doesn't it?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Further, this word &lt;em&gt;the people&lt;/em&gt; have been abused so much, imho,
recently in the politics that it really needs to be stopped. The word
had a glory tone, making it sound &lt;strong&gt;noble&lt;/strong&gt; and &lt;strong&gt;correct&lt;/strong&gt; as if by
default. This is especially promoted by propagandas such as the China
medias. But I have argued and heard arguments before, which I couldn't
agree more, that we are born as &lt;strong&gt;citizen, not the people&lt;/strong&gt;, because,
we define the scope of &lt;em&gt;the people&lt;/em&gt;? In China, it's the authority,
some invisible face says "you are now one of the people, oh, no,
sorry, now you are outside this camp now", that kinda of arbitrary BS,
or I call tags, which, when slapped on you, is just like labeling you
as criminal, or Jew, or witch, or whatever, so to outcast you from
life, trashing you down &amp;larr; honestly, the word doesn't matter at
all, because it's only to serve a sentimental purpose, with a sole
gole to arouse a certain emotion inside some targeted audience, and
viola, my behavior is thus justified, while you are doomed &amp;mdash;
familiar!? You should be, because every single crime against mankind
had been committed using this tactic, no exception. &lt;strong&gt;And the great
danger of this tactic is that label is so damn cheap, that it in turn
makes victim's life, cheap.&lt;/strong&gt; So really, stop calling us &lt;em&gt;the people&lt;/em&gt;,
not until we have abolished its &lt;em&gt;inherited correctness&lt;/em&gt; which is the
core of its abuse. It should be a neutral word that means nothing but
a group of somebody who share a common interest of
something. Period. Just like when we say, the janitors, the taxi
driver, the cooks, there isn't any emotional justification in these
labels, thus will not become a label for crime. It's only when the
lable is emotionally charged that it now morphs into a weapon of
offence, a club that can knock somebody down, then the question
becomes &lt;em&gt;who holds the club, and who is on the other side&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;violence &amp;rarr; fear&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What is happening in these posts? I can accept a different opinion, a
wish for a downfall of your opponent. But a cheer, or a justification,
for violence? I have stated at the beginning about the gladiator mode,
which I start to feel is an inherent dark side of human being. So if
we do recognize it a devil, shouldn't we then remind ourselves to keep
it in its cage, as much as we can, but not cheering when it breaks out
once a while!?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I'm not a pacifist who is horrified by any violence. I think certain
situation does call for action, which will be violent. What the
purpose that will be, I don't know. Each action taker has his/her
justification, of course. Some you agree, some you don't. It's easy to
damn the ones you disagree with, but this is completely relative
&amp;mdash; each side thinks his opinion is the correct one, isn't it!?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But as common sense goes, you don't go into a street fight that just
happened next to you by two strangers, do you? Why!? Because human, or
in that sense any living animals, shun from violence. I doubt anyone,
well, the ones you think you have the justification, will claim and
sincerely act on, that you like being part of a violence. We, as
animals, don't. Violent scenes in life is just disturbing, unsettling,
and fearful. Yes, the word &lt;strong&gt;fear&lt;/strong&gt;, violence brings fear, and fear is
a bad thing, in an absolute term!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When you cheer for a violence, you are literally cheering for fear. I
was gonna say the sentiments fostered by these 抗日神剧， and of
course the propagandas, have become a poison of heart that made many
think violence in real life is as fun and entertaining as the
scripts. I don't advocate anyone to try it out so that you can now
know how terrible a war is. But I see there is a flaw in term of
&lt;strong&gt;memory of a generation&lt;/strong&gt; when younger crops grow up with less and
less intimate experience with such thing, thus thinking it's &lt;em&gt;not that
bad&lt;/em&gt;. WWII to me is still quite recent, not because I'm old, but
because I wasn't born early enough to be fooled that it's all glories
&amp;mdash; the memory of horrror lived on by many many literatures and
movies and arts, and are only becoming stronger and clearer when,
benefiting from time, more evidences emerge, more mysteries solved,
while the winner's propaganda and sentiments wore off &amp;mdash; when it
was first won, victory justified any means; now, looking back, there
are many doubts, many challenges, and many critics, and I believe
these are healthy and necessary reflects!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But then, there is China's &lt;em&gt;victor writes the history&lt;/em&gt; practice, which
creates a Truman's life for its &lt;em&gt;people&lt;/em&gt;, and it's just now becoming
bizzare! Not only it has turned fear an acceptable thing in their
&lt;em&gt;common sense&lt;/em&gt;, but it has rather destroyed an even more fundamental
value of human being &amp;mdash; sympathy.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I may have a very strong opinion against yours. I may not like you, or
even hate you. But hey, watching you lying there to die will still
makes me sad, and brings an urge to help. It's not that I'm super
kind, it's just human. But here are these posts, which not only like
the &lt;em&gt;downfall of the America&lt;/em&gt;, but outright like how it has disgraced
itself.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I think we are too naiive to believe we are different, and too easy to
forget that when the boat leaks, we are all drown. In term of human
and its dignity, there is really only one boat.&lt;/p&gt;</content><category term="thoughts"></category><category term="thoughts"></category></entry><entry><title>2020</title><link href="https://fengxia41103.github.io/myblog/2020.html" rel="alternate"></link><published>2020-12-23T19:22:00-05:00</published><updated>2020-12-23T19:22:00-05:00</updated><author><name>Feng Xia</name></author><id>tag:fengxia41103.github.io,2020-12-23:/myblog/2020.html</id><summary type="html">&lt;figure class="col s12"&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Can't believe how early this is &amp;mdash; it's not even 7:30 in the
evening yet, and still two days away from this year's Christmas. Noah
has been at her place since last weekend, right after his winter break
started, which is fine, cause I do want him to have relaxing time and
enjoy himself. I found it that I miss him a lot when he is not here,
and sincerely wish him having a good time when he is not on my
watch. Sometimes, seeing a young kid being kissed by his parent in a
movie, I start to regret how fast time has flied by, and he is now
already growing up, and soon will be a man who may not want me to hold
him, hug him, and kiss him, anymore. Wouldn't it be sad? Sometimes I
wonder that I feel this way because he is now the sole gravity of my

&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Can't believe how early this is &amp;mdash; it's not even 7:30 in the
evening yet, and still two days away from this year's Christmas. Noah
has been at her place since last weekend, right after his winter break
started, which is fine, cause I do want him to have relaxing time and
enjoy himself. I found it that I miss him a lot when he is not here,
and sincerely wish him having a good time when he is not on my
watch. Sometimes, seeing a young kid being kissed by his parent in a
movie, I start to regret how fast time has flied by, and he is now
already growing up, and soon will be a man who may not want me to hold
him, hug him, and kiss him, anymore. Wouldn't it be sad? Sometimes I
wonder that I feel this way because he is now the sole gravity of my
life and my existence, even though I don't admit it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Woke up from a small nap after dinner while watching the
projector. Life is good. Really, I can't complain this at all &amp;mdash;
I have been taking days off, unofficially, for three days, just doing
nothing, well, not nothing, but nothing related to work, but only
things I do to please myself and to take care of myself &amp;mdash;
exercise, read my books, listen to music, watch movies, chat w/ a
friends, sleep, nap... really, life has been treating me well.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I know 2020 is a tough year for many, especially for those who don't
have a job, which I can hardly imagine. But this year has been a good
one for me. I got my place here in this beautiful building, nice
neighbor who would drop me off some treats for me and Noah once a
while, and besides money, all are well taken care of, so I would feel
pretty safe if walking away for a while. Where was I this time last
year? Shanghai? Kunmin? or Huili? I was there, somewhere, traveling,
and was getting over the episode that was so difficult for me to come
out. I don't think I will ever come out. But it's actually the way I
want it, because I don't want to forget about it. It was the best time
of my life. I know one day when I look back my life, I wouldn't regret
what happened, nor the decision I made. However hard it was, it was
the right thing to do, and the best I could give.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Looking out the window, cars are much fewer in the last couple days
when days are approaching Christmas. The town hasn't been a busy one
anyway, especially since the students left home earlier this year. A
string of yellow lights are flickering w/ some cyclic pattern. I sort
of know which little house it's at. There is this old black woman
living there, and often I saw her sitting at the front the house porch
when Noah and I walked by. It's festive mode, I suppose, that she sets
up the string lights, though I don't know how many people really look
at it for more than 1 second, or notice it at all. But it's the
gesture it counts, doesn't it!? Sitting here, typing this, reminds me
the nights Noah and I went Japan together for the first time, 2012,
wow, nine years ago! Mine! Can't believe how far away it was. He was
only 4, and I was, well, almost 40. But I felt young, and looked
young, probably, too. Not like these days, I feel old, and look ugly.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I don't know how a person changes over the course of years. It isn't
pretty, I'm afraid. But everyone goes through this, unless you die
young. Many residents here are retired. Among them, they compliment me
that I am still young. I guess they are right. If adding 20, I will be
officially old. Yet, 20 years, is a long long long time. Deducting 20,
I will be only 28, mine! What a wonder age that will be! No way of
going back. So one day, when I look back at tonight, I might think the
same thing, deducting 20, I was only 48, how young!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I still don't know how to feel about this town. It's a nice place,
really. Everything is close by, convenient, and pretty good quality so
far. But it only feels home when Noah is here. And it feels just,
empty, when he is not. And there is no Bunny, no 猪猪，no 妞妞. It
feels, too quiet, sometimes, especially when the sun is setting, so
pretty, so red, burning fire in the sky. Yet, I could only watch, and
no one to share. Exile.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Haven't written things for a while. Thoughts come and go. Not at sharp
as before. It's a good thing, I suppose, that I' becoming calmer, less
angry, and smile more. It's a good thing. So this is 2020, same as
before, better than before.&lt;/p&gt;</content><category term="thoughts"></category><category term="thoughts"></category></entry><entry><title>Bach, and shoppings</title><link href="https://fengxia41103.github.io/myblog/bach%20and%20shoppings.html" rel="alternate"></link><published>2020-11-26T10:03:00-05:00</published><updated>2020-11-26T10:03:00-05:00</updated><author><name>Feng Xia</name></author><id>tag:fengxia41103.github.io,2020-11-26:/myblog/bach and shoppings.html</id><summary type="html">&lt;figure class="col l6 m6 s12"&gt;

&lt;p&gt;2020 Thanksgiving day. Sitting here and listening to &lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0Cg_0jepxow&amp;amp;t=833s"&gt;Hilary Hahn&lt;/a&gt;
playing Bach at the end of the concerto, what a wonderful sound! When
I was at Noah's age, Dad used to listen to Bach and Hendel, and I
thought they were no comparison to the pop songs I liked, and they
were not only not beautiful, but rather ugly, close to being a
noise... how time has changed! and how much I have changed! Maybe it's
the age, that is teaching me now to appreciate this music, and the
mind too fragile to handle the stimulation of youth, the bang bang
bang, but seeking now peace, calm, and indeed, beauty.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The big shopping day of the year. I had crave for a few things, but
then, while tuning up the volume w/ the remote and letting Bach to
fill in the room, I can't help thanking myself that I made this
purchase, and it works so nicely, and making this moment all the more
enjoyable than ever. That, however, also got me thinking, back in …&lt;/p&gt;</summary><content type="html">&lt;figure class="col l6 m6 s12"&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The big shopping day of the year. I had crave for a few things, but
then, while tuning up the volume w/ the remote and letting Bach to
fill in the room, I can't help thanking myself that I made this
purchase, and it works so nicely, and making this moment all the more
enjoyable than ever. That, however, also got me thinking, back in the
days, when people were not living with luxury (well, there were always
some who had more than necessities), they only had, and probably cared
about, things that were practical in use. If the thing happened to be
also artful, bonus. Didn't all the antiques, like those super
expansive bowls or tea cups or plates, were all useful things!?
Instead of just being a play thing on the shelf, which seems to be the
identity of art or artifact, they were actually active participant of
daily living activities. They may look delicate, but they were
supposed to be durable and can sustain rough hands.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This same idea has been echoed in this book, &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/Peaks-Lamas-Classic-Mountaineering-Buddhism/dp/1593760582"&gt;Peaks and Lamas&lt;/a&gt;,
that Tibetan, though lived a poverty life if judged by industrial
standard, but their life had beautiful things that were not diminished
by their minimal living style at all. It's really a mindset, that they
spent that much money on things that an industrial person would not
care, yet, we industrial people crave for those arts they have but
using for daily routine tasks. How ironic!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So while holding the remote, I start to think that the craves I had
these couple days, especially on this shopping day, is but another
testimony of this irony. I should really remind myself not to purchase
just because they are on discount. It would be much more pleasing to
fill the room with beautiful, and useful, things, than a pile of,
things that are good deals but idling. This makes me wonder, aren't we
now in the &lt;strong&gt;Age of Junk&lt;/strong&gt;, that many many affluent people buy things
without giving enough debate whether they are practical or necessary
(of course, they always convince themselves of the purchase that they
were practical and necessary). Instead, they just give in to the
desire, but in nearly all cases, ended up living with a thing they
don't love anymore, and look ugly. It's the sense of chasing novelty
winning the race, while the sense of beauty was left behind. Sad.&lt;/p&gt;</content><category term="thoughts"></category><category term="thoughts"></category></entry><entry><title>CP &amp; miro</title><link href="https://fengxia41103.github.io/myblog/cp%20miro.html" rel="alternate"></link><published>2020-11-12T15:13:00-05:00</published><updated>2020-11-12T15:13:00-05:00</updated><author><name>Feng Xia</name></author><id>tag:fengxia41103.github.io,2020-11-12:/myblog/cp miro.html</id><summary type="html">&lt;figure class="col l6 m6 s12"&gt;

&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;What a shocker!!! 7:30 in the morning, all hands meeting, it was
announced that CP is canned, officially, and Miro is leaving the
company. Wow.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I was left a bit speechless, I have to say. It's probably so for all
the others on the phone. I found it rather comical when the big boss
kept asking whether you have any question, and now is the time to
ask &amp;mdash; this is a rather cunning strategy that asking people in a
pose of fairness while putting everyone in a shock mode first. What an
insincere moment!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So the product that I have been looking down for the last two years
are finally seeing its death. But this is still sad for me. It reminds
me what Todd said before &amp;mdash; if the team has a problem and you
have been there long enough, you are part of the problem &amp;rarr; at the
time I heard it, I was young and optimistic, and I felt it was rather
cynical to view oneself in that light, as if you are …&lt;/p&gt;</summary><content type="html">&lt;figure class="col l6 m6 s12"&gt;

time I heard it, I was young and optimistic, and I felt it was rather
cynical to view oneself in that light, as if you are either a solution
or a problem, black and white. But this line is the first jump to my
mind when I heard the news, and am I indeed becoming a problem now
that belongs to a story of an unsuccessful project? I have been so
used to success that probably a defeat like this is a long past due,
and the cliche of &lt;code&gt;x%&lt;/code&gt; of software projects all fail was just a,
cliche, as a convenience to quote, but doesn't relate, nor hurt. What
a shame. I feel hurt actually not of any personal pride, but rather,
the number of $$ spent in acquisition of such crappy technology to
begin with, of the mediocre, and some just downright incompetent,
people hired, and the waste of all these money and time while a much
smaller team with some much better minds could have made some much
better technology and product, and really made a difference not only
for the company, but for ourselves, and for the technology community
at large! What a waste, and that is really making me sad. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It's sad also because I realize all these wastes are not the
exception, but the norm. Talkers achieve spotlight importance by being
loud and confident, and doers are too busy to &lt;em&gt;fix things they built
at the first place&lt;/em&gt; to spend time understand those high ideals which,
in most cases, don't even make sense. But hail, in order to keep the
comrade spirit, to be polite, respectful, tolerant, and so on, we shut
our mouth and let the talker take the center stage, and eventually,
like this moment, talk the whole ship into the abyss while everyone
onboard is going to drown. I have always pictured what it will be like
in a war, when I were assigned to a team while talkers are either in
position of a commander, or just peer out in a mission with me, what
would I do? &amp;mdash; if I don't care, their ignorance will get me
killed; but if I do conflict, well, he might pull out the gun and
shoot me from behind... so either way, I get the short end of the
stick. How can this not be sad!?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Had a 1:1 w/ Miro yesterday afternoon. Disappointing I have to say. He
gave me the official script while I was hoping to make a conversation
just like two friends saying goodbye to each other after 4 years in
the same trench. I don't know what got into his mind these days. I
used to view him as a good friend who is not only capable technically,
but mentally tough and sincere. Not anymore. I feel there is a wall
between us since CP. I thought it was just that he was so busy now
with his big title and we had little time to chat, so we naturally
grew apart. But yesterday made me wonder it has always been that way
perhaps, just that I had always thought differently. Oh well, doesn't
matter anymore. I'm happy for him to move on to larger role and bigger
stage. But I hold that the so called three pillars he claims to be
leaving behind to hold the torch are, well, ranging from ok to not ok
at all. If he is sincerely think his choice has been so good, well, I
beg to differ, and I will say his view of human as a manager is
mediocre at most, unlike his technical skill and vision, which I rank
it as one of the best. So I guess, all these sayings can be concluded
in one, that he is not perfect, either, as I had regarded him to be,
more or less. Well, that is sad I would say.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A rather stormy raining day today. There is some weather condition
passing by I heard. Feels like a metaphor of the feeling &amp;mdash;
gloomy, somewhat lost, feeling uncertain of what the future beholds,
anxious? maybe. I think, most of all, is that, there is one person on
my mind I want to talk to, to hear the voice, to lean against, sob, or
just seek a comfort, but can't. I heard &lt;a href="https://ja.wikipedia.org/wiki/%E9%AB%98%E5%80%89%E5%81%A5"&gt;たかくら けん&lt;/a&gt; loved
someone and then never married for the rest of his life. I start to
wonder, that is the fate I will, and want, to have.&lt;/p&gt;</content><category term="thoughts"></category><category term="thoughts"></category></entry><entry><title>Weekend violin</title><link href="https://fengxia41103.github.io/myblog/weekend%20violin.html" rel="alternate"></link><published>2020-11-01T09:48:00-05:00</published><updated>2020-11-01T09:48:00-05:00</updated><author><name>Feng Xia</name></author><id>tag:fengxia41103.github.io,2020-11-01:/myblog/weekend violin.html</id><summary type="html">&lt;figure class="col s12"&gt;

&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Pushing open the window on this Sunday morning. Here it is, again,
the sound of violin, was silent before, now, like the fresh air washed
by the rain &amp;mdash; cool, clear, crispy, 飘进来, so fit for the time,
for the day, for the weather, for the moment.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I haven't yet figured out where that is from. It was only on
Saturdays, and, I think it comes as a live &amp;larr; someone who is
playing it, maybe a morning practice, whoever this is, s/he is very
very good, because it sounded just like &lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q3-5144TaYg"&gt;Hilary Hahn playing Bach&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Fall is here. Leaves in North Carolina have not yet all turned
colors. New England must have lost all its Fall already by this
time. Actually it was on the news that Boston got 4" of snow! That is,
even too early, for Boston. Here, it's Fall, Fall, Fall, leaves are on
the street, on the trails, colorful, wonderful, sometimes messy after
a rain, but still, stepping on them feels like walking on a thin
carpet, and even …&lt;/p&gt;</summary><content type="html">&lt;figure class="col s12"&gt;

it felt fine. The creek by the trail grew quite a bit from the
rain. No wonder no fish was found there, I think the water is too
rapid for them to stay in one place and raise a, family. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ah, here it is again, the violin resumes its sound. This time, it
feels rather, far away, not like last time I heard it, I thought it
was right below my window, maybe the neighbour downstairs is the
player, but right now, it feels it just came with the air, with the
rain, with the sound on the street when cars, not many of them,
driving by, on this early Sunday morning, not really early anymore,
the clock says 9:57, but we just closed daylight saving last night, so
it's really the 11 o'clock before. But it's ok, late or not, it's a
good moment. Like the cool air coming to my feet, makes me wonder
whether I should go pull a blanket, but then, it's better this way,
reminds me a slight discomfort when I traveled last winter, reminds me
the town I visited, reminds me .... the music is like a string, that
when I'm there, in China, it strings me back to here, where I have the
music, the books, the nice, comfy life.. then, when I'm here, it comes
to me, just like this, reminds me the trip, the road, the people, the
moments.. what is the word? eclipse? yeah, 白驹过隙, when it's
memorable, when it's nice, when you wished it would stay, for long,
for long...&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So are the ones in your life, so is the life itself, so is the moment,
like now.... they are like pearls, each a piece, then, here is a
string, be it a music, a song, a picture, a poem, a book, a note, a
conversation, that connects them all together, even though you don't
often see it at all, but it's there. And the pearls are now like a
necklace, you may not wear it often, but when you put it on, once a
while, maybe, or when you feel so, it shines, quietly, not to dazzle
your eyes, but to make you, elegant, pure, calm.&lt;/p&gt;</content><category term="thoughts"></category><category term="thoughts"></category></entry><entry><title>Saturday morning in Chapel Hill</title><link href="https://fengxia41103.github.io/myblog/saturday%20morning%20in%20chapel%20hill.html" rel="alternate"></link><published>2020-10-17T07:22:00-04:00</published><updated>2020-10-17T07:22:00-04:00</updated><author><name>Feng Xia</name></author><id>tag:fengxia41103.github.io,2020-10-17:/myblog/saturday morning in chapel hill.html</id><summary type="html">&lt;figure class="col s12"&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It feels like vacation, this working remote from home, that's how it
feels, to me. Not only the work is not fully loaded relative to my
capacity, but the rhythm of life, especially when Noah is at mom's
place, just myself, sitting here, watching out the window to the
horizon, to the street, to the sunrise, the sunset... everything of
these moments, remind me the moment of trips I had taken, the one in
Japan, the one in Cambodia, the one is Huili, the one in
Kunming... just like this, sitting by the window, after a night's
sometimes sound sleep, sometimes an uneasy one, watching a place,
feeling familiar but at the same time strange.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There is this little barber shop across the street. The barber, Ken,
said he opens at 7 o'clock in the morning on Saturday. Here it is, the
lights are on. When all the surroundings are still gray from waking
up, the lights shine through his shop window rather feels brighter
than it actually is, but standing out for sure. I …&lt;/p&gt;</summary><content type="html">&lt;figure class="col s12"&gt;

up, the lights shine through his shop window rather feels brighter

customer at that hour of the day. Then why? He looks like a decent
man. So is he running away from his family by lying about his shop
hours? But why, then? I will ask him next time.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On the side of his two-story building, there is now a giant mural,
almost black and white (mostly shades of grays, no colors), of a
person with a guitar. Noah and I actually bumped into the guy who was
doing the painting on the first day, I should say, on his first
night. We were coming back from Cary, turning around the corner of
this street, wow, here it is, this giant &lt;em&gt;mural&lt;/em&gt; on this wall!!! It
was 9, maybe 10, at night, and the weather was quite clear and
pleasant. I got curious whether he did it with paints, or is a printed
wall decal. So we went over after parking the car. Then it turned out,
what I was looking at was a &lt;strong&gt;giant image projected&lt;/strong&gt; on this wall!!!
About 30 feet away from the wall, there is this projector. So the guy
projected it so he could use spray paints to mark out the
outlines. Then, the next couple days, he came back during day and
worked on it, and many many many people stopped by, taking
pictures. There were these three girls, who drove their car here, and
each then pulled out some camera gears, and took photos of this
wall!... and here I am, sitting on the my bed, just waking up from a
Fall's Saturday, and here it is, right next by me, on this wall, as if
the artist just painted for me. If there were truly God, I now have to
say, I feel I'm being spoiled by him. Thank you.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Election is near. Terrible atmosphere. When Trump was first elected, I
thought he was an unconventional politician and may do unconventional
things instead of the status quo, you know, play the political
game. But now, I give him credit for his smartness, he is sharp and
not stupid at all, but he is not a nice person, and that says it
all. The country is split, all the news of violence here and there,
the topic of Trump is becoming a synonym of Chinese medicine, a taboo,
if you still want to have a pleasant and meaningful conversation. One
thing I like the most of America is the friendliness of strangers,
that you can bump into anyone on the street, give him/her a smile, and
you get one back, and you feel safe and comfortable approach anyone
for a chitchat. Not anymore. You start to see them wearing a &lt;em&gt;party
sign&lt;/em&gt;, like a halo, and you ask yourself which side s/he is on, and
that deters the thought to approach them. What is this? It's fear,
indeed, and that's what Trump's four year brought, fear.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I wonder whether the book I read reflects my mental state at the time?
Like music, the same piece can hit you so hard on one day that makes
you cry and cry and cry, then, you listen to it again, and I can't
find that emotion anymore! So for the books. Picked up the sequel to
the &lt;a href="https://fengxia41103.github.io/myblog/humans in new york.html"&gt;Humans to New York&lt;/a&gt;, more portraits, more stories, but I
didn't have the sensation anymore. One or two still touched me, but
the most of them felt, mediocre. The author lost the casualness of
those shots in the first album. Also, I feel the first album had a
&lt;em&gt;passion&lt;/em&gt; in it, that he had so many shots of a person's hair, such a
sophisticated piece, a person's hand wearing all sorts of rings and
stones, or a pair of socks, or a tatoo... all these, felt, more, life,
more real, more, interesting, because, all these, are a part of a
person, that s/he deliberately made, put it on, and thus, mean
something to her. Face may be the standard representation of a person,
but all these little things are even more revealing, of who they are.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Sun is rising. The light is now casted half way over the hotel
building I could see directly from my window. On this side of the
street, still shadows, and the barber shop's light, is on, and no
customer, no cars driving by, hardly even pedestrians considering the
large population of young college kids in the neighbourhood. A quiet
Saturday morning, chilly outside. It's Fall, and watching the leaves
on the ground and some of them just falling from tree and were still
dangling and dancing in the air on its way down, what a name,
&lt;strong&gt;Fall&lt;/strong&gt;, indeed, it is Fall, as everything is, falling down.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A line from the book, page 147, a woman across a desk:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"I'm eight-six. And that's about enough. I'm ready to go."&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"Aren't you afraid of death?"&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"Why would I be?"&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"Isn't that sort of a natural condition of living?"&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"Not when you miss your husband as much as I do."
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It has been a while that a book can hit me like that. Maybe it's still
true that images are more powerful to me than words, like that
&lt;a href="https://fengxia41103.github.io/myblog/funeral.html"&gt;funeral pic&lt;/a&gt; I bumped into on a China trip. And here it is, two
sets of books I grabbed from the Nice Priced Books yesterday, really
out of nowhere ans I didn't even remember where and how I found them!
Yet, for the first time in my life, I felt, a human being, I mean, a
stranger, can bring warmth, to me.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;These portraits are not photographically perfect at all, not even in
focus sometimes, and in some I feel there were too much colors, and
the subjects tended to be a lot of old people, young kids, gays, a bit
like a focus on the population that are inherently weak and vulnerable
in the society, thus easier to evoke a strong feeling of sympathy,
admiration, and so on... But for this book itself, I will not call it
a cheap sell, because I feel the photos …&lt;/p&gt;</summary><content type="html">&lt;figure class="col s12"&gt;

in the society, thus easier to evoke a strong feeling of sympathy,
admiration, and so on... But for this book itself, I will not call it
a cheap sell, because I feel the photos genuine, so were the comments,
there are a few that I feel are being asked to pose in a certain way,
but overall, like its title, it's a human story, and it's the human,
that shines through these pages, w/ a picture, or not, with a perfect
smile, or not, with a balance of any agenda, or not... so is human,
not perfect, so is society, not perfect, so is life, not perfect.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;These photos were extractly randomly, actually, from the book, while I
was chatting w/ a friend about this book. So I just took some photos
to show her, and had a few comments to share my thoughts of them. I'd
like to save them here because, as a set of &lt;em&gt;random&lt;/em&gt; samples, they are
actually as good as the album itself. In the end, it's not the photo
that touches you, it's the thought, the moment, an echo, that lingers
in the mind, that, will not go away.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;figure class="col l3 m6 s12"&gt;
  &lt;img src="images/humans%20in%20nyc/style.jpg"/&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;What a style, both of them!! These are incredibly pleasant to my eyes
even though I agree all little kids are cute, but the boldness and
confidence of the one on the right! Bravo!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;figure class="col l3 m6 s12"&gt;
  &lt;img src="images/humans%20in%20nyc/speak%20to%20my%20dad.jpg"/&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Doesn't all adult have such a moment? &amp;mdash; that you remember
something important, someone important, you, even didn't crash, but
will lower the head, not with pride, but with regret? That's how I
feel, and I felt the stuck inside.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;figure class="col l3 m6 s12"&gt;
  &lt;img src="images/humans%20in%20nyc/something%20beautiful.jpg"/&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;With a growing age, I start find myself more and more admire youth,
their energy, their boldness, their possibilities. Yet, I often felt
totally disgusted by the shallowness and
I-want-that-because-everybody-has-it kind of trend chasing
taste. Especially when listening to Chinese shows and sometimes their
articles, I felt even compelled how superficially happy they are all
trying to appear &amp;larr; I don't mean to preach that life is hard kind
of talks. Rather, I felt a disappointment that such a wonderful mind
is wasted by directing his/her focus to those BS. And here it is, a
beautifully phrased statement I truly felt it's the strength of youth,
and youth alone, can, and should, claim. She, is beautiful.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;figure class="col l3 m6 s12"&gt;
  &lt;img src="images/humans%20in%20nyc/skateboard%20girl.jpg"/&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;What is humanity? a sympathy? a willingness to help, to share, and to
care? If skateboard has been an icon of youth who spent hours outside
home, hanging out w/ friends, and not studying, then I learned
something entirely new to me, today. Not only I'm charmed by her
smile, but am won wholeheartedly by her mind. What a noble idea!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;figure class="col l3 m6 s12"&gt;
  &lt;img src="images/humans%20in%20nyc/shadow%20is%20changing.jpg"/&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Guess what popped into my mind then? 匠人... how, unromantic was I!!!!
I really like the answer, because myself wish to know what is
important, and what is not, so that I don't end up wasting the
remaining of this life but for something worthwhile, such as catching
a fleeing moment, a changing shadow.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;figure class="col l3 m6 s12"&gt;
  &lt;img src="images/humans%20in%20nyc/kafka%20puppet.jpg"/&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I don't know which character is this in Kafka's novels. Tried to read
one the other day, &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Trial"&gt;the Trial&lt;/a&gt;, couldn't finish it. I remember in
college reading &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Royal_Game"&gt;the Chess Story&lt;/a&gt;, very, agonizing story, that the
guy was playing chess in his own mind and was driven rather crazy if I
recall. I'll probably revisit these books someday. Later in life? I
don't know. I don't whether aging will help to understand them. I do
think the puppet show's markups are magnificantly done.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;figure class="col l3 m6 s12"&gt;
  &lt;img src="images/humans%20in%20nyc/incredible%20style.jpg"/&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It's a cliche that gay are good at style and dressing up. Just look at
this! This is far more than a style, but rather, a point of view of
this world, that here I am, and I think I am beautiful.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;figure class="col l3 m6 s12"&gt;
  &lt;img src="images/humans%20in%20nyc/heart.jpg"/&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This, made me want to cry. Yes, I thought of my dad &amp;mdash; yes, the
mind can be gone. But, there is still the heart.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;figure class="col l3 m6 s12"&gt;

the prison part, that will be me, and I wish my letters were also

&lt;p&gt;This is a topic I have always wanted to write about and research,
because, there are too many times that myself gets tripped up by
arguments or stories presented by someone, that sounds quite logical
and reasonable, but tickles me inside that &lt;em&gt;something isn't
right&lt;/em&gt;. But, what is it? I haven't been able to pin down. The reason I
call this article "logic fallacies" because fundamentally I believe
the &lt;em&gt;something&lt;/em&gt; is a wrong in its logic, its way of fabricating a
causal relationship whereas there isn't one. I truly want to
understand their method in order to identify them and expose them
(honestly, I have this urge to open a lecture, a school maybe, in
China, to talk to people of my findings, if any, so to apply these to
other stories audience can relate and see the common pattern.. what
can I say? I'm a big fan of patterns).&lt;/p&gt;

medicine vs. Chinese medicine. Here is a miracle doctor who treated a

&lt;p&gt;This is a topic I have always wanted to write about and research,

can I say? I'm a big fan of patterns).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is probably viewed as an example of those epics of western
medicine vs. Chinese medicine. Here is a miracle doctor who treated a
patient, often the story teller him/her-self with &lt;em&gt;success&lt;/em&gt;, such as
prolonged life (or avoiding death completly), while the same person
has been seeking medical treatment from hospitals, but has been told
&lt;em&gt;no more can be done&lt;/em&gt; (thus, a death sentence). Therefore, the
contrast is:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;table&gt;
&lt;thead&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;th&gt;Hospital doc&lt;/th&gt;
&lt;th&gt;Miracle doc&lt;/th&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;/thead&gt;
&lt;tbody&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td&gt;Follow western medical practices&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;Unconventional practices, doesn't even need to be medical&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td&gt;Nothing we can do to improve or change this condition&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;Prolonged life, and sometimes even healed&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;/tbody&gt;
&lt;/table&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And the conclusion to follow is that there are powers out there which
we don't understand, and such unconventional practice can be more
effective in some circumstances. To make the statement more personal
and sounding, story teller is often professional trained to believe in
western science, such as a doctor him/her-self, but that belief is now
shaken.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There are multiple logic fallacies in play. Let me try to explain one
by one.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;it implies causal, but there isn't one&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The story didn't use the word &lt;strong&gt;because&lt;/strong&gt; explicitly, but its logic is
clearly pointing to a causal relationship that patient's improved
condition is the result of whatever done by this miracle doc. So the
equation is:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Because the miracle doc did A, patient's condition improved.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;First of all, patient's condition improved is a necessary condition,
thus can not derive that miracle doc did A. In other words,
enumerating however many patients who have improved or survived after
the hospital sentences, will never get us to draw conclusion that
miracle doc did A (or B, or C, or any).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Second, in order to establish such a causal relationship, one must
isolate the changing factor of the patient's life &lt;strong&gt;to one and only
one&lt;/strong&gt; &amp;mdash; miracle doc's intervention. If we can't establish such a
controlled environment, even in lab, how do we know it's not some
street food the patient has eaten last Wednesday that has done the
trick!? Or, for that matter, if we introduce the butterfly effect, why
not a South America bufferfly who has done the trick!? There are
endless possibilities out there, each is equally true (or false) as
the intervention. Unless we have a way to rule those out, picking one
out of a haysack is clearly not convincing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;it is self-contradicting&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Another cornerstone of the story is that hospital has drawn a
conclusion (which, unfortunately, isn't good for the patient's
ears/heart), thus enter the miracle doc when no hope is in sight.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But, let's consider the transition from hospital's decision to the
miracle doc.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If the miracle doc is to take the hospital's conclusion as an
"assumption", thus using his practice to challenge its legitimacy,
which, in all these stories, is to prove the assumption wrong, then
apparently, a single case is not gonna do it. Let's say hospital
determines 100 patients beyond hope, and they all went to this miracle
doc. If miracle took place 10 times, we still have 100-10=90 patients
who die just as the hospital predicted! If only presented by the
numbers here, one would immediately think hospital is a better prophet
than the miracle doc -- what it said actually came true! So in this
case, the story has just defeated its purpose ~~&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Alternatively, the miracle doc says, "I'm only taking patients that
hospitals don't take anymore", meaning I'm only treating patients who
have run out of hope w/ hospitals, then, why are you now **trusting
the hospital's conclusion (=out of hope) as your foundation, while
your eventual conclusion is that hospital was wrong! And if the
conclusion stands, wouldn't it then mean that hospital's conclusion
was also wrong, therefore, these patients didn't run out of hope when
they came to you! &amp;mdash; in either way, you see the logic is
self-contradicting, the premise and the conclusion is constantly at
war, and in no way both can be true at the same time!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Let's put this way: hospital in this sense is being staged as a
middleman, if I can get to the God (the miracle doc), why bother to
try the inferior middleman? Let's go straight to the source!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;treating exception as a rule&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I have argued &lt;a href="https://fengxia41103.github.io/myblog/science.html"&gt;against science&lt;/a&gt; before. I'm not here to retract my
criticism of it. While too many things are being called &lt;em&gt;scientific&lt;/em&gt;,
when they are, I want to use one necessary condition of science for
the following argument &amp;mdash; how repeatable is it!? Being
scientific, or engineering for that matter, to me, meanings the same
outcome is achieved whenever the same inputs are given.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now apply this to the story. First of all, hospital saw and cures far
more patients than probably the life time of this miracle doc. This I
don't think anyone wouldn't agree with.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Second, if we collect some percentage of improvement on both sides,
guess which one has better score!? &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The fallacy is treating an exception as the rule. And honestly, if you
can't repeat your trick reliably, coming to you will be like drawing a
lottery for cure &amp;mdash; it's not a doctor, it's just dumb luck!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;using a non-fallable statement&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After the challenged listed above, the defense has retreated to be&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;"You have to admit that Chinese medicine has its value", or, &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;"There are things we don't know, right? So it could be just your
   ignorance that you can't comprehend the power of this miracle"....&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;"Everyone has a preference. I believe it, and I don't force you to
   agree with me"&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The problem of the first two are simple &amp;rarr; they can not be proven
right or wrong, because &lt;strong&gt;they are perpetually true&lt;/strong&gt;! &amp;larr; yes
there is always things we don't know (actually by definition, or,
rather ironically, this is the view of science, not the view of
metaphysics or religion, which these miracles actually belong), and
yes I could very well be ignorant of this miracle method.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But, if I ever turn around these sentences to them, without changing a
single letter, they are also true! and that is exactly the problem!
&amp;mdash; when it is forever true, it's really just a big stick to end
discussion.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The last one is tricky, because it literally puts the story now into a
religious sphere, in which science does not have a seat. Therefore,
there is no point of discussion or debate anymore because no ground
can be built upon &amp;mdash; it's like in an olympic game, and now we
decide to scratch the rules in the middle of a race, who will be the
winner, or loser, or anything!? The entire race has now lost its
meaning.&lt;/p&gt;</content><category term="thoughts"></category><category term="thoughts"></category></entry><entry><title>Conflicting course</title><link href="https://fengxia41103.github.io/myblog/conflicting%20course.html" rel="alternate"></link><published>2020-09-03T13:57:00-04:00</published><updated>2020-09-03T13:57:00-04:00</updated><author><name>Feng Xia</name></author><id>tag:fengxia41103.github.io,2020-09-03:/myblog/conflicting course.html</id><summary type="html">&lt;figure class="col l6 m6 s12"&gt;

&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Watching this &lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ledJBbRfH8g"&gt;youtube&lt;/a&gt;, it suddenly occurs to me, what I have been
debating with myself &amp;mdash; the &lt;a href="https://fengxia41103.github.io/myblog/technology and society.html"&gt;technology and responsibility&lt;/a&gt;, why
technology needs to reflect on what this technology really means, even
in a hindsight, is better than ignoring its effect, has a root
cause. Yes, it is a &lt;strong&gt;fear&lt;/strong&gt;, that once we develop a powerful weapon,
the possibility that it falls into the &lt;em&gt;wrong hand&lt;/em&gt; is always
there. Therefore, the more powerful the weapon is, the worse a damage
it will do to us, when &lt;em&gt;abused&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That's it!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now, the question is, when I develop a technology, should I then
consider this possibility, or just brush it aside, "Hey, that's
someone else's job. Let me just focus on make this work." Can I, or
should I?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It seems obvious the answer is, no you shouldn't just ignore it. But
then, if the possibilities are endless, is theren't a way to prove its
negation, right? This is the same as &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/Physicists-Guide-Skepticism-Faster-Than-Light-Pseudoscientific/dp/0879754400"&gt;this book&lt;/a&gt; starting off that
even though there is always the possibility, however, certain things
have …&lt;/p&gt;</summary><content type="html">&lt;figure class="col l6 m6 s12"&gt;

even though there is always the possibility, however, certain things
have been proven very unlikely to be true, for example, that a speed
higher than the light speed. Therefore, there can a similar argument
that if we do "so and so", that will reduce the possibility of it
falling into the wrong hand or used in a &lt;em&gt;wrong way&lt;/em&gt; so &lt;em&gt;unlikely&lt;/em&gt;,
that it is ok to develop it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But then, of course, this also brings another dilemma, that if you
view the world from a physicist's prospective, yeah it won't have
anything than light. But, isn't light speed itself a definition by
physicist? So, it feels like they are both the referee and the player
now. Then, if I change a lens, wouldn't I then suddenly open up a line
of different possibilities? Well, in that matter, who defines the
"wrong" hand anyway!? Terrorist is certainly justified their deeds by
saying they are the savior, and the other guy is the evil.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I don't know. I think it is important for engineers to think more of
their actions and what they mean, even though it seems very
self-defeating and even irrelevant. I think at least there is one
aspect of being an engineer that does put them in the best position to
think about these things &amp;mdash; as the first line solider, they know
the most of the technology, thus having the best information to
evaluate and ponder what they mean, what they can do, for good or for

&lt;p&gt;This is an email w/ teammates regarding my thinkings on microservice
arch and a few other things happening in the project which I
dislike. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Read at your convenience ~~&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;SOA is hard, and I haven't seen it working&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I first learned &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Service-oriented_architecture"&gt;SOA&lt;/a&gt; (and an IBM &lt;a href="https://www.redbooks.ibm.com/redbooks/pdfs/sg246303.pdf"&gt;book&lt;/a&gt;, very comprehensive) in
2013. I was in charge of designing the architecture of a 3-million $$
project for a Fortune 500 company. Yes it was SOA-ed, but not, no one
can implement it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I have been in this trade long enough to see these patterns come and go,
every so many years they come back in a new emperor's
dress. Microservice arch seems to be the same thing. It's popular in all
meetings and talks. We assume ourselves ignorant if we can't name a
single project personally that has successfully pulled it off. But the
reality, I'm afraid, is that except a few deep pocket giants, no one has
done it according to book, and it never will.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;SOA requires a ESB (enterprise service bus) for messaging (data), and
&lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Business_Process_Model_and_Notation"&gt;BPM&lt;/a&gt; engine …&lt;/p&gt;</summary><content type="html">&lt;figure class="col s12"&gt;

&lt;p&gt;SOA requires a ESB (enterprise service bus) for messaging (data), and
&lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Business_Process_Model_and_Notation"&gt;BPM&lt;/a&gt; engine for workflow orchestration. Both concepts are sound. I
love them. But they are very difficult to implement. The bottleneck is
not technology, but to abstract biz workflow so much so it can be
delegated to BPM engine, and maintenance (BPMN is too hard for client to
learn) because biz logic is constantly changing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;Talk is cheap (rant)&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It's a cheap word to make one look good and sophisticated. But here is
my view &amp;mdash; if you propose it, you do it. I'm frustrated that
&lt;em&gt;architects&lt;/em&gt; roll of their tongue these buzz words as if they are ready
to grab, but they never code any of them, and they usually end the
sentence "Any question? If no, you do it".&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There is another popular version of the same superficial talk in China,
&lt;a href="https://fengxia41103.github.io/myblog/mature tech.html"&gt;so-and-so technology is mature and simple&lt;/a&gt; used to justify the proposal
is low risk.. just because you can say the word, doesn't make it
simple. There are different level of credits to this statement (best -&amp;gt;
worst, in order):&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Yourself has coded it, even as small part of a large proj/module.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;You have a die-hard buddy John, and he has done it and showed to you
   before.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Your friend John has a friend Alex who claims he is coding it.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;You and John and Alex all read about it on a SO post, or a book, or a
   meetup, and know it's a trendy thing to do right now.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;You all know that Google is using this technology and it's
   awesome (but, are you Google?)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You get the spirit. I had same conversation w/ my client in 2013. It's a
common mistake non-engineer make. Just because Google can do it, doesn't
mean I can, or this team can. There are plenty such example in
life. Pick up any Physics book, the theory of atomic bomb is
printed. Can you then build one? Yeah we all know US has built a bunch
for a while, does it make it easy if you, or your country, to build one?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Talkers don't care details; but they dont sweat making the claim
that "it is simple", either.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;container, microservice&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Microservice architecture is good, but too good to be true. Forget about
benefits. Let's talk problems we can perceive.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It's not justified &lt;em&gt;monotholic&lt;/em&gt; design is natively bad. One common
   sales pitch is "your company's systems are all silos, and mine is a
   one-stop-shop".&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If each micro-service is a full stand-alone thing, aren't we then
creating a bunch of &lt;em&gt;silos&lt;/em&gt;?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Modular.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Code naturally become modular because repetitive pattern emerge
during coding, and I hate to copy&amp;amp;paste. So up to 10th time, I start
think to make it a &lt;em&gt;module&lt;/em&gt; (whatever the name is) so I write one
line to call it. I'm sure you echo this.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I worked w/ an IT woman in 2010. At a lunch break, we were talking
how tolerant you are before you want to &lt;em&gt;automate&lt;/em&gt; sth. I considered
myself pretty hardcore to eliminate repetitive works using
scripts. Her answer was, "1". It's an exaggeration I thought. But the
mentality is sound -- constantly think how to combine things into a
logical group, thus "module", so to save yourself the trouble.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Top down design.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Top down to do modular in design is great, if the person has deep
knowledge of the domain, and is responsible. His/her view essentially
makes decisions that function XYZ should be a service/module on its
own, or not. It's a very difficult decision. Whoever says it's easy
is a liar.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My first job was in a semiconductor company making lithography
machine. The entire project (300+ people) was directly by this one
guy. He was an engineer, 60s maybe, gave us a talk every week, and he
knew everything of that product -- mechanical, real-time control (my
job), everything. I haven't ever met such situation after. Guru is
wonderful, if they are real. In 99.999% cases, it's &lt;em&gt;con artist&lt;/em&gt; w/
impressive title.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Container.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Container is a packaging choice. It can't package anything. Some code
can and benefit from it; some don't. The one single blocker I would
consider is that it is a single process -- if your thing can live w/
it, good. Otherwise, you need other trick to scale horizontally,
which adds complexity in knowledge and maintenance. Therefore,
speaking "containerizing" sth as if it were a given is ignorant (the
atomic bomb example above).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My view is that a container is yesterday's CD/ISO. Fit your music on
a CD doesn't make your music suddenly good, if it were bad.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;By choosing docker and k8s, it comes an &lt;em&gt;ecosystem&lt;/em&gt; that makes things
&lt;em&gt;easier&lt;/em&gt;. But. It shouldn't replace the knowledge if you were to do
it without them -- if you can't maintain an accounting book using
paper and ink (let's say all the Excels are dead today), are you
still an accountant? These ecosystems, like python native and 3rd
party libraries, require you to learn, to try, and some work out of
box, others don't as claimed. So, it's same engineering practice, not
magic.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I know LXCO architecture is microservice &lt;em&gt;oriented&lt;/em&gt;, at least some
components, such as an aggregator (API proxy), access gateway. It's a
living example to examine. I don't know the status of it, nor how
good/bad it is. Find it out yourself if you are interested in. Talk to
engineers who code it, not manager's PPT.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;in CP?&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We can't, and we shouldn't.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Service MUST maintains its own state. Each will have at least an admin
interface (aka. UI), and an API.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Therefore, there can't be one UI team coding all these UIs. Each service
has a UI person to code and maintain and add feature and debug. Same for
UX.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This leads to more considerations -- how to reuse components, or not?
and common technology stack, or not?...&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;CP is sort of service-oriented. What can be done is to break up
components into its own repo, its own build pipeline, its own release
schedule, and of course, finish each w/ an admin interface and API if
missing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now, the million $$ problem, is the STATEs. The complexity has been
hidden by Postgres &amp;amp; Scylla, because &lt;a href="https://www.codeproject.com/Articles/359654/11-important-database-designing-rules-which-I-fo-2"&gt;DB's model and constraints&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;guarantee&lt;/strong&gt; a logical relationship between two data points. But in a
group of isolated services, it's fishy. I don't have knowledge to
suggest further reading or thinking. At least, read &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fallacies_of_distributed_computing"&gt;this&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Remember. Technology might be &lt;em&gt;mature&lt;/em&gt;, but until we built one crude
versioin, that wonderful theory is, theory. &lt;/p&gt;</content><category term="thoughts"></category><category term="thoughts"></category></entry><entry><title>Can you do this?</title><link href="https://fengxia41103.github.io/myblog/can%20you%20do%20this.html" rel="alternate"></link><published>2020-08-21T13:45:00-04:00</published><updated>2020-08-21T13:45:00-04:00</updated><author><name>Feng Xia</name></author><id>tag:fengxia41103.github.io,2020-08-21:/myblog/can you do this.html</id><summary type="html">&lt;figure class="col l6 m6 s12"&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The 1:1 meeting went pretty badly. Over the last 4 years I had been
working w/ this team and this person, and I'm having serious doubt of
the upcoming &lt;em&gt;new initiative&lt;/em&gt;. So feeling compelled I spoke up (yeah I
know, I tried to silent myself for a few weeks. But this is against my
view of integrity, really, by watching the rain derail without
sounding an alarm). But you know what? Negative message is never
welcomed, when there is a &lt;em&gt;positive&lt;/em&gt; one that is the mainstream. So
the conversation went like this:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A: "I need to see daily progress. If that is not happening, then
something is wrong and we should review it." (this is perfectly
reasonable).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Me: "I'm hesitating to promise such daily progress. Let me ask you
this. When was the last time you followed someone's blog to get the
result it says? In my experience it never happened. You copied and
pasted, and it didn't work. So you googled and found some other posts,

&lt;p&gt;A: "Then you must have been using the wrong blog."&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Me: "(pause) That's the million dollar question, right? How do I know
it is the wrong blog?"&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A: "Look. Basically I need someone who can do it. If you don't think
you can, then I need to find someone who can."&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Me: "(long pause) If there are other things to do, then I probably
should do those instead of doing this project."&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A: (to smoothe the blow) "Yeah there are others"
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I felt really bad that evening.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I consider myself quite a &lt;em&gt;can do&lt;/em&gt; person. I have done more than the
job has asked, and has been always on the lookout to help the team not
to blow too badly. Yet here it is, I'm the one who &lt;em&gt;can't do&lt;/em&gt; it, not
to mention I feel I'm letting his down when he needs someone to do
this.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But then, how do I reconcile w/ the view which I totally disagree!?
Should I speak up? or should I not?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;if you can't, move aside&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I have heard this before, in China. Too many times, this is a catch
all phrase thrown at people who really know what he is doing, by
someone who doesn't, but having the authority to say so. The common
cliche is, of course, that this person might possess some &lt;em&gt;unknown&lt;/em&gt;
information, thus if he is asking you to do it, you should just bow
and do it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But, I'm sorry. My experience has been different. I'm not stupid, and
I don't consider this information asymmetry is even healthy (see &lt;a href="https://fengxia41103.github.io/myblog/domain knowledge.html"&gt;this
blog&lt;/a&gt;). This is the exact thing that people use to maintain power,
and it is poisonous! Asking me to do something without an explanation
is completly bizzare, because that's essentially the same logic that
you are guilty until you are proven innocent, and btw, you need to
prove it yourself. So collect the evidence and present to me, and if I
agree, you are innocent. Fxxx you.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is outrageous! BS! If you want me to do something, explain your
case first. And, since you are not gonna do it yourself, thus you are
asking me to do it, better respect my opinion when I say No! Period. I
know better, don't I? Otherwise, I would simply say, do it yourself.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The saying of "if you can't do it, I will find someone who can" is an
outright bully &amp;mdash; "go for it" I would say. If you can find
someone who likes to bow his/her head, agree with your view, go for
it. Really. I don't need it, and I don't want it, and I hold on my
view based on my judgment, and that is that. Especially I spoke with
my full good conscience thinking the situation is wrong. So if you
don't like it, too bad.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I know there are many bosses out there who just want to "get things
done". I get it. But if you don't know what the done is, or can tell a
good one form a bad one, you are exposing yourself to all sorts of BS,
that at the end of day, yourself will suffer. I'm sicken tired of
hearing the high-profile talks in these days' meetings where the
talker has not even the basic training in software development, nor
the specific domain the product is built upon. So, how can they
shameless talk about the next moon landing project without feeling a
bit of hesitation when an engineer raises his hand "Sir, but this is
not a good idea"?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I feel really frustrated by how things are being conducted here. I
suppose all companies are similar. But honestly, I never expect it can
get this far. The analogy I constantly think of is that being a foot
solider, when generals are ignorant and make mistake, soldiers die in
vain. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That's what is happening in front of my eye.&lt;/p&gt;</content><category term="thoughts"></category><category term="thoughts"></category></entry><entry><title>Earthquake</title><link href="https://fengxia41103.github.io/myblog/earthquake.html" rel="alternate"></link><published>2020-08-09T11:46:00-04:00</published><updated>2020-08-09T11:46:00-04:00</updated><author><name>Feng Xia</name></author><id>tag:fengxia41103.github.io,2020-08-09:/myblog/earthquake.html</id><summary type="html">&lt;figure class="col l5 m6 s12"&gt;

&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;No kidding!!!! Earthquake!!! Wow. For the first time in life, and I'm
sincerely hoping this will be the last also, I experienced an
earthquake, and honestly, that was, scary!!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So while I was preparing breakfast, I heard this rattling sound from
my beloved Raaks shelf, then a sound of "stomp" coming from top, like
someone was running across the apartment upstairs. What the heck!? I
was thinking to myself, how could someone be running so heavily, and
how could it be so poor of sound insulation! But then, it didn't make
sense because the building is make of steel and concrete, and I
usually don't hear a soul while living here except the aisle door open
and close once a while. So how could it be!? So I reasoned that maybe
there is something wrong w/ my A/C that it was shutting down at the
time, thus making such a loud noise.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ha! Untill I was then chatting w/ Ariel, and she said she just
received a notification of an earthquake in NC!! .... So …&lt;/p&gt;</summary><content type="html">&lt;figure class="col l5 m6 s12"&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Ha! Untill I was then chatting w/ Ariel, and she said she just
received a notification of an earthquake in NC!! .... So then we
compared notes, and I now know for sure the rattling was caused by the
quake. Wow wow wow. What a sound it made! What a scary thing if one
thinks of it &amp;mdash; what if the shelf collapses? what if the ceiling
collapses? I'll be dead, just dead. There is no way I could ever
survive those weight on top of me. Oh mine mine mine. Let's pray this
will not happen. Honestly, it's not fun.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Chatting w/ Ariel was initiated with something completly irrelevant w/
earthquake in mind. Saw a post on Huawei's announce of its running out
of chips, thus the next release will be the &lt;em&gt;final&lt;/em&gt; batch, and it made
it very, sentimental, as a hero finally lowers his head. Sad.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is disgusting! This is cheap, disgusting sales pitch taking
advantage of popular sentiments, but without ever reflecting the bias
it has been held and promoted since. Not only the lithography is only
a buzz word on their tongue, but it will not solve the problem at
all. If one hails Huawei's 5G technology as achievement, why do we at
the mean time trash the same kind of achievements by others!? Is there
now a Chinese physics vs. the rest of the world's!? Engineers are all
human. We have family to raise, health to take care, headaches to deal
with. What supports me to keep itching in technology, or work, or
life!? Not some grand ideal of national liberation, people happiness,
but just humble reason of making a living, doing a decent job, being
curious about new technologies, unsatisfied with current poor
solution, even some self arrogance that I'm smart and can think of a
&lt;strong&gt;better solution&lt;/strong&gt; than this!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Engineering is universal, just like physics. There isn't different
gravity in China. A good engineering principle is applicable both here
and there. Without observing it and practicing it, it fails regardless
which geo it lives in. If Huawei has done a good job developing its
suite of technology, great! But that doesn't cancel out others'
achievements, which, in practical term, is far greater and more
impactful than Huawei's. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This type of post is like a parasite &amp;mdash;
it lives off a couple buzz words, but will only kill the host, not
making the host stronger. I have written about big data analysis, AI,
cloud computing, container, a few such buzz words popped up in the
last few years, and everytime, the same pattern was played out,
resulting in nothing but another in dumpster because "it is not trendy
anymore"! How sad! and how superficial! How pathetic!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Technology development is literally a course of trial-and-error,
almost randomly even, that the more you tried, the closer you may be
towards a working POC. There isn't a shortcut, and there isn't a
conspiracy. US may have censored chip, but there are too many other
weakness ready to be grabbed! Think of it. If github is blocked today,
can any of the existing system still operate, let alone bug fixing or
new feature!? Absolutely not! If it were banned today, China's
software development is back to the stone age instantly. None of the
code will compile anymore. Period. It's absolutely unthinkable if this
happened. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The point is, technology is inter-dependent to the degree that no single
country can ever survive on its own anymore. It is mission
impossible. It's not a matter of $$, not a matter of national
pride. It's a fact, and a good fact actually &amp;larr; again, if there is
only set of physics law governing this earth, stop thinking you will
be independent if only you had no foreign technology. It's a dead
end. The only way is to be a contributor, not to the West or the East
or whatever group name, but to humanity.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The China's world view of "either you are one of us, or you are one of
them", is not only harmful to itself, but harmful to raising a social
conscience that engineering is not meta science, but hard work, hard
thinking, no short cut, no 弯道超车， 半道超车， only respect to what
others have proven, and try to stand on giant's shoulder, to reach
higher.&lt;/p&gt;</content><category term="thoughts"></category><category term="thoughts"></category></entry><entry><title>Moving out, finally</title><link href="https://fengxia41103.github.io/myblog/moving%20out.html" rel="alternate"></link><published>2020-07-27T22:36:00-04:00</published><updated>2020-07-27T22:36:00-04:00</updated><author><name>Feng Xia</name></author><id>tag:fengxia41103.github.io,2020-07-27:/myblog/moving out.html</id><summary type="html">&lt;figure class="col l6 m6 s12 center"&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Today is the day. Moved out, spending night at new place. No bed, just
a comforter on the floor. But it's ok. Had a fight w/ Noah,
again. Enough. I don't want to be hurt, and hurt him, anymore. It's
better this way.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Sitting here reminds me the days in Shanghai bnb, also a comforter on
a floor, cheap but manageable, and works for the purpose &amp;mdash; being
close to 泰康's shuttle bus stop, so I could visit dad everyday. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But now, what is the purpose? I'm lost. I miss bunny already. I wish
to hear her meowing now. She would be bored here. I know. It's better
for her to be there, there are just more things for her to chase, to
watch, to get excited, and perhaps, to dream about. So, what is this
life?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It's not a new life to me at all. It's an exile.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The other day on the way back from 517, Noah asked me why I bought
this place. I said the No. 1 reason was that …&lt;/p&gt;</summary><content type="html">&lt;figure class="col l6 m6 s12 center"&gt;

place, and that, gave it a meaning. Otherwise, all places, any places,
would be the same to me &amp;rarr; they are nothing but a place, like what
I have here right now, quiet, too quiet, pretty looking, but rather,
soulless.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So, it is how it feels to move out. Seven years, finally, this is
happening. I don't feel happy, or sad, or much emotion at all. It
feels, just, lost.&lt;/p&gt;</content><category term="thoughts"></category></entry><entry><title>Tragedy in life</title><link href="https://fengxia41103.github.io/myblog/tragedy%20in%20life.html" rel="alternate"></link><published>2020-07-26T14:50:00-04:00</published><updated>2020-07-26T14:50:00-04:00</updated><author><name>Feng Xia</name></author><id>tag:fengxia41103.github.io,2020-07-26:/myblog/tragedy in life.html</id><summary type="html">&lt;figure class="col l6 m6 s12 center"&gt;

a letter. Too many memories coming back to me, reminds me
of 2006. It's hard. Such a thing, is always, hard. There isn't easy
way out. There isn't even a way out. It's a dead end, sad, dark,
lifeless. Stopped by Amy's house, Alan walked to the door, eyes are
red. I didn't know what to say, or what else to say. I couldn't
speak. It's hard for parents to lose a child, especially when they
themselves are old. I can't imagine how I can cope with such an even
if it happened to Noah later in life. I would probably survive, but
only half of myself will be left, if half can be left.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The pic I saw on the China trip kept popping up in my mind &amp;mdash; the
彝族 father saying farewell to probably his son at a funeral. Sadness
has no boundary, even if it were of a stranger. I could feel the
emotion, the pain, the hopeless cry, the light going out. Life is
fragile, when you see thing like this, happen in front your eyes, even
it is just a piece of paper, a printed photo! It doesn't retain
happiness for long, that how soon we just forgot the happy moment of
last night, last week, last lover. Yet, sadness, is like a dead
weight, doesn't fade, doesn't disappear, it lingers on and on,
consumes anyone coming across its path.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Can one be heartless? and will it be, easier? I don't know. It's just
difficult, the life itself, is difficult. I used to be full of
optimism, thinking I could manage, come out of, keep head above water,
and so on... now, it doesn't look promising at all. Life is so long
that it is scary. We don't know what cards God has for us. But I start
to wonder that all hands dealt are just as bad &amp;mdash; one is born
with a full body, full heart, a clean soul. Then, like wind chipping
away a rock, little by little, it looks nothing like its origin
anymore, potholes all over, wierd shape and angle and slice and dice,
ugly, rough, part of it crumbles... that, is the fate of, everybody. &lt;/p&gt;

there is a difference between the Chinese ban of Google (to be more
precise, Google was not banned, but it chose not to conduct business
anymore &lt;em&gt;voluntarily&lt;/em&gt;), and the ban of Huawei &amp;mdash; China set up a
house rule, say, censorship, that applies to anyone conducting in his
realm, so it is an objective law regulating everyone, not just
Google. If you don't like it, I don't like you either. But US, on the
other hand, is actively talking to his &lt;em&gt;allies&lt;/em&gt; using carrots and

clubs to ban Huawei, with, according to the popular view, the sole
objective to choke Huawei, thus China, to death.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There is a logical fallacy, I think, in this argument, because house
rule itself does not justify its, fairness. As a matter of fact, the
definition of a house rule is &lt;strong&gt;exactly the opposite&lt;/strong&gt; to fairness
&amp;mdash; using the house door as a virtual or physical threshold, a
house rule deliberately spell out that there are now two camps of
human in this world, those inside this house, and those outside this
house. Therefore, it is the exact definition of a segregation. Even
worse, it is a segregation based on any arbitrary criteria the house
owner likes or dislikes. So &lt;strong&gt;to discuss fairness within the scope of
a house rule is complete nonsense&lt;/strong&gt; because the root of a house rule
is a personal preference, while fairness is a thing that can only
exist beyond personal preference.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If China justifies its blocking Internet access to Google using the
house rule, wouldn't it also justify any business owner posting a sign
"&lt;whatever racial or sexual identity&gt; only"? I would hope that the
answer is No. So how is this difference from China's house rule?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Further, even if it is a law, well, like any other law, being it a law
in physics or a law in court, is subject to challenge. If there is a
single aspect of a law being fair, it is not its current content or
intention, but its readiness to be challenged, by anyone, literally,
anyone on this planet. Period. A law that presented itself as &lt;em&gt;absolute
right&lt;/em&gt;, well, by history, is always a fallacy, a FALSE that does more
harm than help. While I'm writing this, Noah is having a Bible study
w/ two older kids from a local Chinese church over Zoom meeting. Even
as firm believe of their doctrine, they are not offended by Noah
posting all kinds of &lt;em&gt;bizzare&lt;/em&gt; questions regarding the Bible. That's
what this should be.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But,that's exactly there the fallacy the article's author has
committed &amp;mdash; the Chinese house rule has been posted as an
unchallengable decree with a sole argument that "if you don't like it,
you are not welcomed here". What this really is not a house rule,
actually. On the contrary, it is still a belief system, an ideological
camp, that manifests the idea of 非我族类，其心必异, which then, leads
to one and only possible consequence, &lt;strong&gt;intolerance&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This, is another case in point I have said in other articles before,
that author such as this is a coward. S/he is afraid to admit the true
cause of such action is based on ideology, but instead, making it a
subject of law and order, so to give the idea a sense of neutrality
and objectivity. This is rather pathetic. Why am I so afraid of
admitting my belief in an ideology, and stand the fight and challenge
on that ground and that ground alone, if I feel confidence of my view
and my act? &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Even worse, in some of the responses it was positioned that house rule
was such in order to protect the people.. well, I have had enough
writing on &lt;a href="https://fengxia41103.github.io/myblog/people.html"&gt;people&lt;/a&gt;, which to me is a huge neon sign of
fallacy. And is protected from what!? In a response it was asking why
then Stackoverflow is also not accessible. I know! When I was
traveling, it puzzles me that SO was not accessible, or was painfully
slow, for no apparent reason! What's there that is ideological!? I
mean, does using an API or a Python call harming the house in any
fashion? Arguably it can be, because it can be used to access harmful
information. But then, if the entire Internet is really just an
infinite pool of information, it becomes pointless then in this chain:
api &amp;rarr; info &amp;rarr; harmful belief &amp;rarr; ban. So literally, this
becomes a ban on information itself. Dark age, isn't it?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Fallacy, like any other fallacy, fulfills itself, forever true, and
forever invincible. It is a heroic act to claim one's ideology/belief,
live to it, defend it; it's a cowardice to avoid the ideological
challenge, instead, keeping its followers by making them ignorant,
docile, and quiet. Is this fair? In a sense, yes, because all its
followers are treated the same way &amp;mdash; a walking dead.&lt;/p&gt;</content><category term="thoughts"></category></entry><entry><title>Should I</title><link href="https://fengxia41103.github.io/myblog/should%20i.html" rel="alternate"></link><published>2020-07-15T20:45:00-04:00</published><updated>2020-07-15T20:45:00-04:00</updated><author><name>Feng Xia</name></author><id>tag:fengxia41103.github.io,2020-07-15:/myblog/should i.html</id><summary type="html">&lt;figure class="col l6 m6 s12"&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It is a very curious question, and it is a super fundamental question
&amp;mdash; the question of moral compass. Isn't there thing that we
shouldn't do, without reason/condition/excuse? If so, how do we
determine?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It all started w/ a &lt;em&gt;regular&lt;/em&gt; struggle with Noah and his homework
today. He didn't do his Kumon, but claimed he did. The conversation
went around and around with common excuse that "I can't focus" "why do
I need to catch up all these" "I didn't lie", and on and on and
on. Led him to the sidewalk outside the house, and asked him to rob a
car or a neighbour if no one is going to catch him, and he refused to
do so. So I was trying to make a point that there are things that are
wrong to do, thus we don't do it, regardless whether we will be caught
or what the punishment can be. Yes there is always a fear factor that
restrict our behaviors, and that's in the realm of law. But there is …&lt;/p&gt;</summary><content type="html">&lt;figure class="col l6 m6 s12"&gt;

wrong to do, thus we don't do it, regardless whether we will be caught
or what the punishment can be. Yes there is always a fear factor that
restrict our behaviors, and that's in the realm of law. But there is
another realm, and that's your moral. Unfortunately, as of writing, I
think his moral is very weak, and on some aspects simply don't
exist. It sounds pretty cliche, or normal, for a child. But I'm
struggling w/ this &lt;em&gt;view&lt;/em&gt;, because there are things that so
fundamental and core that there is a native recognition, inborn
understanding, that we don't them, like killing someone walking by,
stealing neighbor's whatever, or, lie.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I start to realize lying is a tendency that, in a way, is an original
sin, that everybody carries. We lie because we are caught in a
scenario that the truth will hurt yourself, thus we choose to lie so
to pretend things didn't happen that way, or that we could get away
unnoticed. The root is that we had an action we feel shameful to
admit, so we lie. But it's more than a matter of convenience. It's
poisonous, contagious, and even more humiliating than the mistake you
are trying to cover. Christian will bring up God as the police that
you have to face him eventually for your lies. Noah doesn't face God,
and I don't believe in Him yet. So what hold us not to lie? Apparently
nothing. So Noah chose to lie about his homework, over and over and
over, and punishment such as taking away his TV time, or grounded for
the day, or a lecture by me, none worked, none checked this habitual
instinctive reaction in such circumstance.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So are we then doomed? I think we are. But it makes it even more,
rewarding, if we face the impossibility, and fight to do the &lt;em&gt;right&lt;/em&gt;
thing &amp;mdash; be honest w/ my mistake, be apologetic to my wrong
dealing from time to time, be regretful w/ what I could have done
differently for a better outcome. It is difficult, and many times I
fell just like he did, because I didn't see so, or because I didn't
feel lying was an unbearable shame... many many times. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yet, I always picture myself one day lying on my death bed, looking
back at myself and my life, there are moments I feel proud of myself,
that I defeated this native tendency and chose the harder course
because it was the &lt;em&gt;right thing to do&lt;/em&gt;. It may have hurt me one way or
another, and probably made no difference at all. But I felt proud, of
myself, of the courage I had, of the person in that moment who made
that choice. Honestly, those moments were the only thing that made
you, and your life, worthwhile. Few of us leaves any legacy behind as
fortune and fame. Most of us will pass like a dust in the wind, left
no trace, and have been forgotten as soon as we are dead. But we
passed this world once, passed this life once, experience, had. In
those moments of honesty, you didn't just pass by, you were immortal.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I wish one day Noah will read this, and wish then that he would
understand, and agree w/ my argument. I wish.&lt;/p&gt;</content><category term="thoughts"></category><category term="thoughts"></category></entry><entry><title>Cart and Horse</title><link href="https://fengxia41103.github.io/myblog/cart%20and%20horse.html" rel="alternate"></link><published>2020-07-12T10:57:00-04:00</published><updated>2020-07-12T10:57:00-04:00</updated><author><name>Feng Xia</name></author><id>tag:fengxia41103.github.io,2020-07-12:/myblog/cart and horse.html</id><summary type="html">&lt;figure class="col l4 m6 s12"&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It's a turmoil time, in America. It's a huge confusing time, that the
Corvid-19 is being used as a case in point that China has done a
brilliant job controlling the virus, while US is failing the &lt;em&gt;test&lt;/em&gt;
miserably, systematically. On top of all these, there is the racial
fight, that all lives matter, or some lives matter, or B life matters
(only?), and the looking back for redemption of historical sin, be it
slavery, Columbus being a terrible person (and he was, based on what I
heard on YouTube, and Noah confirms that), and so were the other many
famous figures whose statues are now being questioned, toppled, hailed
at its destruction, at its disfiguring, at its humiliation, at its
deglorification.&lt;/p&gt;

status can still stand if viewing in such a hindsight judging w/

History&lt;/a&gt; how we can study history, or even view history, and ever
be &lt;em&gt;objective&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;em&gt;neutral&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;em&gt;factual&lt;/em&gt; &amp;larr; it is theoretically
impossible.cThen, what's on the other side of all these &lt;em&gt;good words&lt;/em&gt;!?
&amp;rarr; bias, prejudice, discrimination, and so on.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The logic seems to be in a loop, that cart and horse, chicken and egg,
which goes first? Many of the articles criticizing America's failure
of dealing w/ virus and other social issues are rooted in a premise,
in my opinion, that US has all the capacity to make a happy life for
its citizens (and the entire human race), but it failed to do so,
because it's so illy prepared that resulted in shortage of masks,
ventilators, hospitals, jobs, and on and on and on, and therefore, as
a consequence, people die, suffer, not having the American dream.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;However, who don't we question these, assumptions, first!? Who said
American should be granted with such a life? Why would hospital stock
enough ventilators while it doesn't know, and would never be able to
predict, how many it needs for the next, emergency? And even once we
know the wave is coming, how would we be so sure that we could have
just stock up and ramp up, and will be ready for the hit, if we had
chosen!? Honestly, even w/ good preparation and sincere effort as
hoped, a disaster strike will still be, disastrous. It's like wearing
thick clothes when removing a hornet nest from your porch &amp;mdash; yes
it will make the sting less painful, but no it's not a solution, thus
should not be the goal on its own. Rather, you should start asking why
hornet decides to put a nest there, and anywhere else he could live
peacefully with you &amp;mdash; after all, hornet didn't nest there just
to annoy you. Sorry, he puts there because he didn't know it's YOUR
HOME, and he sees it only a suitable place for his purpose, and likely
you probably have driven him there because he doesn't have any woods,
grasses, trees, shades, to build anymore since you wiped the
environment out to build your highways and houses!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Same here. Virus is not a phenomenon that God is punishing human. It
has been in the nature, somewhere, until it touches one out of
thousands of living things it touched already, human. We view them as
evils, and they are, to us. But it's only a relative thing. We human
are arrogant, just like we think American is arrogant, that we think
we deserve a certain type of treatment, that the world, or the
planent, or the universe, should bend to our will, cater to our
interest, and satisfy our desire. That, is the root of all these, ill
feelings. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I don't mean we should give up expectation, because that is not
humanly possible. But I do think we should reestablish a discussion of
social contract, that means two parties enter an agreement, and each
end holds right, but more importantly, responsibility. The fight, if
is a mean to bring the other person to the negotiation table, is
necessary, but is not a mean to claim a victory, because negotiation
is not a mark of either victory or defeat &amp;mdash; it should be the
starting point when two sides are now on the same footing, no more, no less.&lt;/p&gt;</content><category term="thoughts"></category></entry><entry><title>Racial</title><link href="https://fengxia41103.github.io/myblog/racial.html" rel="alternate"></link><published>2020-06-13T22:57:00-04:00</published><updated>2020-06-13T22:57:00-04:00</updated><author><name>Feng Xia</name></author><id>tag:fengxia41103.github.io,2020-06-13:/myblog/racial.html</id><summary type="html">&lt;figure class="col s12"&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There are many reflection articles these days after the George Floyd
event, and I found them quite interesting because I think there are
many problems in their implication and logic. The other day Noah and I
went to see a protest in downtown Chapel Hill, and a sign said
essentially "if you are not solution, you are part of the problem". I
knew this line at work, but now in this context, I found it misleading
also.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;right to be silent&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;First of all, the advocate to voice your stand. An article asking the
Chinese in America to take a stand and voice your opinion, because, if

same right as me observing a silence. They are the same right, equally
true, they are my decision. Period. The risk of being …&lt;/p&gt;</summary><content type="html">&lt;figure class="col s12"&gt;

&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There are many reflection articles these days after the George Floyd
event, and I found them quite interesting because I think there are
many problems in their implication and logic. The other day Noah and I
went to see a protest in downtown Chapel Hill, and a sign said
essentially "if you are not solution, you are part of the problem". I
knew this line at work, but now in this context, I found it misleading
also.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;right to be silent&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;First of all, the advocate to voice your stand. An article asking the
Chinese in America to take a stand and voice your opinion, because, if
you don't do so to support the ones in need, there would be nobody to
do for you when they come to you. That's the logic. But here is a
problem. In my view, the right of taking a stand of any kind, is the
same right as me observing a silence. They are the same right, equally
true, they are my decision. Period. The risk of being bulled because
I'm silent is real, but that's exactly the problem we are fighting
&amp;mdash; I shouldn't fear being silent, just as I shouldn't be shamed
being loud of my opinion, either.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;origin of sin&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Second, the origin of sin. This is a really flawed base for
argument. The often quoted &lt;em&gt;fact&lt;/em&gt; that slaves were dealt inhumanly and
involuntarily requires clarification, because on the surface they were
so, but there are more to it, according to my own common sense. No 1.,
you can't just claim you are 满族 just because you have a funny
surname, or a unique hair style. How do you prove the origin of your
ancestor? Wouldn't it be already a discrimination if the origin is a
default just because of the skin color? Further, slaves at the time
were purchased, like your refrig, with the sole purpose to be in
production and serve. I can't picture anyone at home constantly want
to give the refrig a kick or smash it to pieces entirely, and felt
happy about ut &amp;mdash; then what, buy a new one, or live w/o a
refrig!??? So were the &lt;em&gt;owners&lt;/em&gt; of these ancestors &amp;mdash; they must
be brutal and blunt, just like capitalist maximizing your workload,
but they don't have an inborn tendency to destroy you at will just for
the heck of it. It doesn't make sense. These types of origin of sin
statement is nothing but a 道德至高点, and is exactly the same fault as
saying that race  so and so is inferior &amp;mdash; because these things
can't be changed, you don't choose your parents, thus you don't choose
race, or color, or hair, or eye, or height.... and you don't choose
what happened 400 years ago either. It happened. We can't change
that. If we don't like it, let's not make it happen again is all we
can do.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;minority = victim?&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Third, minority vs. majority. Such categorization is itself, a BS. If
taking society as a whole and we slice it, I bet there are many slice
sample in which the minority in one sample group is the majority in
another. Then what, does it then make the minority in that sample a
bully target? can it derive that you, as the majority in this sample,
has a tendency to bully? Of course not. Neither. Being minority is
only measured by one dimension, population, and that doesn't lead to
whether it's bullied, or it need protection, or it's precious because
it is rare. Well, if population is the root cause, how about 6-7 kids
per couple encouraged by a fat check per kid at birth! then who will
be the &lt;em&gt;minority&lt;/em&gt; in 20 years? do you think that solves the problem?
Of course not. Thinking us as &lt;em&gt;minority&lt;/em&gt; is nothing but a victim
sentiment &amp;mdash; it's the same as the origin of sin, that we have
predefined ourselves to be a victim, and of course, then there will be
many &lt;em&gt;examples&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;cases&lt;/em&gt; to prove that we are &amp;larr; by the same
token, I bet there are also &lt;em&gt;examples&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;cases&lt;/em&gt; that prove &lt;strong&gt;we are
not&lt;/strong&gt;, then what?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;equal of what?&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Next, equal right. It's tempting to announce that the ultimate goal
for everybody is to have equal right. I believe this is a misread of
the "we are born equal" &amp;mdash; first of all, we are not born equal,
as anyone's body can testify, how come they have that beautiful face
and I don't!? There is a slogan of "equal access to opportunity",
which I totally agree. The sign of civilization is that we are
becoming specialist, each one of us, each one of our ancestors. This
itself has guaranteed that your skill/knowlege will be in fashion
today, and mine might be in trend tomorrow &amp;rarr; therefore, it's a
utopia to seek being equal in an abstract sense. It is even shaky to
say we have equal access to opportunity &amp;larr; if I know Python and
you don't, how can you have equal access to a Python job as I do!?
It's simply an argument for argument's sake. So drop it! What we can
strive is an equal treatment by &lt;strong&gt;providers&lt;/strong&gt;, not an equal
development by any measure! By treatment I mean the mean to &lt;strong&gt;navigate
in a society&lt;/strong&gt;, say, I want to switch a career by learning Python, I
should find teachers/videos/classes subject only to my Python skill,
which is cold, objective (well, it's another debate whether there is
anything objective at all). &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yeah yeah, if you insist that the test is crooked, and the one who
made up the test is already biased against you, then, honestly,
nothing can be fair, and nothing can help you, or anybody &amp;larr;
again, this is just another way to say, you have an origin of sin, so
shut up &amp;larr; isn't this the exact thing your fight is all abount!?
How ironic.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;I benefit from&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It's very interesting that many articles establish a logic that the
rights we, let's say, Asian America, is enjoying is thanked to MLK and
movements like those. I agree, and disagree.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I believe the life we have today is a result of all of the above, of
every single step/event ever happened to mankind, just like our
individual's morning coffee isn't existing out of thin air. Rather,
it's the accumulation of every single second you have so far lived
&amp;mdash; any change in the past would have resulted in you not sitting
here w/ this coffee.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So yes I agree the civil rights movement was truly a respectful
achievement. But to make it an advocate that we need there stand by my
color-ed brothers and sisters because &lt;em&gt;I owe them&lt;/em&gt; is flawed. If
following this logic, let's see whom I should be thankful to
first. The founding fathers, of course, without them, there isn't this
country. Well, what colors were they? and veterans, folks who died to
protect us in the two world wars, and the Civil War, what color was
the majority? &amp;larr; doesn't this now lead to that I should thank for
the light skin because they made the most sacrifice? This is the exact
opposite the logic was hoping to convince.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I think we should appreciate all went before us, regardless its color
or whatever. We appreciate them because they represented something I
like to have, today. They worked for it. Like I tell Noah these days,
if you care it enough, make it happen, don't wait for others to make
it happen for you. So same here, ask yourself what you want, not ask
yourself whom you owe to.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;freedom of speech&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The only reason for politician to exist is that they represent their
interest group and are wanting their gain. Like in business, the
inborn tendency is that a company wants to become monopoly, because
that's the definition of maximum of my gain. Therefore, the only
inborn tendency for politics is dictatorship. If we all agree monopoly
needs to be prevented, so is dictatorship, a single voice that says
anything it wants without a challenge. The sheer fact that America is
now in turmoil that all kinds of interests are shouting for fairness
or whatever, is a great sign that this country, though has come a long
way on the path to big government and dictatorship extreme, is not yet
losing its diversity, its check and balance, and that, is the
fundamental thing we should care about, nothing else.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I think those Chinese articles are completely missing this point,
because they take it for granted that freedom of speech is a cliche,
and isn't even arousing because it's too, bland. On the contrary, the
purpose of any shouting game or debate or argument or law suit is that
you want to &lt;em&gt;silence your opponent&lt;/em&gt;, and that is the exact inborn
tendency of a monopoly. It's not only in a government, in a police
department, in a society, but in each one of us, and that's the evil
inside ourselves we must, must, be aware, and fight, individually, and
together. We don't have an option here. Just like when I was jokingly
complain of getting old to my doctor, and he quibbled "think of the
alternative".. hahaha.... so seriously, shout, and have an equal
volume, that's my version of utopia.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;Conclusion&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It's a difficult time. It's a time we live in, thus can't see from
without, and can lose sight of things which were otherwise
obvious. I still think this country is the best experiment mankind has
come up so far. It's flawed, rigged, even broken, but it's a flag not
yet down, and think of the alternative ~~&lt;/p&gt;</content><category term="thoughts"></category><category term="thoughts"></category></entry><entry><title>Thoughtless</title><link href="https://fengxia41103.github.io/myblog/thoughtless.html" rel="alternate"></link><published>2020-05-23T10:24:00-04:00</published><updated>2020-05-23T10:24:00-04:00</updated><author><name>Feng Xia</name></author><id>tag:fengxia41103.github.io,2020-05-23:/myblog/thoughtless.html</id><summary type="html">&lt;figure class="col s12"&gt;

about it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Did another POC over the last two weeks, &lt;a href="https://github.com/fengxia41103/dev/tree/master/git-to-jira"&gt;an git+jira
analyzer&lt;/a&gt;. Maybe it's the tiredness after an intense
development. Could be. Caught up w/ Dr. Shen, Tong Jin, and Jessie
yesterday. Putting a will questionnaire together. Gradually, I'm
putting my life in order, and preparing my life to be closed
whenever. Not that I'm ready for death, but I want to leave w/o much
left-over regrets. Make me wonder whether everyone has an urge to
&lt;em&gt;leave something behind&lt;/em&gt;? But then, how many people's biography really
interests others? I haven't even read anyone's, including the famous
Jobb's. Yeah I do watch documentaries that describe a person's life,
and always finding them &lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8utBPHp88PY"&gt;inspiring and memorizing&lt;/a&gt;. But hardly I
would think anyone wants to read mine, nor would I read it as a
reader.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So, for a life, for a life like my Dad's, what would he have left
after he leaves? All his traits disappear without a trace. His family
will gradually die out if children becomes less and less, and even w/
children, how many of his traits will be passed on? Not many. Each
generation is a new crop. So in the end, it's very true that we came
fro dust, and end as dust.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So on the questionnaire, I put down:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I'd like to be cremated and have the ashes divided into two. 
One is to be scattered in an unknown farming place anywhere in Japan.
The other is to be scattered in HuiLi County, Sichuan Province,
P.R.China.
Pick a Spring sunny day with a lot of wild flowers in the field. 
No permanent memorial of any kind.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Be a nameless is not only a common fate. It's the ending I'd like to
have &amp;mdash; nameless, hopefully, also regretless, or less-regrets.&lt;/p&gt;</content><category term="thoughts"></category><category term="thoughts"></category></entry><entry><title>Fangfang-style diary</title><link href="https://fengxia41103.github.io/myblog/fangfang%20style%20diary.html" rel="alternate"></link><published>2020-05-13T13:23:00-04:00</published><updated>2020-05-13T13:23:00-04:00</updated><author><name>Feng Xia</name></author><id>tag:fengxia41103.github.io,2020-05-13:/myblog/fangfang style diary.html</id><summary type="html">&lt;figure class="col s12"&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It bears a style of smoothness and, calm, that, amid this Corvid-19

that's where I find it strange!&lt;/strong&gt; &amp;mdash; even though it wants to make
a feeling of the hidden turmoil, it feels artificially,
philosophical. This exact same effect can be witnessed in those Wechat 3x3
photo grids as well. Just how many times your friend(s) posted nothing
but a single photo, or a grid of them, without description? Did you
ever wonder what that means!? To me, it was rather, ridiculous,
because fundamentally it spells an air of superiority, that the author
is saying either "how come you can't grab what I mean (as if I'm
stupid)", or essentially whatever your interpretation can be, s/he can
easily brush it off at will that, "you don't understand", "you don't
get it", or if s/he pleases, "you are my soul mate"... well, both ways
are just the same, the same degree of BS and the same degree of
egoism. In the end, this is just another form of &lt;a href="https://fengxia41103.github.io/myblog/euphemism.html"&gt;euphemism&lt;/a&gt;, which
&lt;strong&gt;I have deemed the cancer of communication&lt;/strong&gt;. However, Chinese, as
far as I know, loves this, and that's why the Fangfang-style catches
on like a wild fire. Sad, honestly.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Another aspect of these diaries brushed me on the wrong side is their
title. Like this one, "DC Diary", makes me feel absurd. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I think these titles are simply a &lt;strong&gt;misnomer&lt;/strong&gt;, because this could
very well be viewed as the same fallacy when we make a comment like
"yeah Americans are arrogant", or "yeah all Chinese are good at math"
(see what is wrong w/ such &lt;a href="https://fengxia41103.github.io/myblog/generalization.html"&gt;generalization&lt;/a&gt;). Apparently, such
statement bears no value if you examine them &amp;mdash; for God sake
there are 300 million Americans, and 1.4 billion Chinese, of course
not all Americans are arrogant, nor all Chinese are good at math. I
think even Noah's age understands that much. So, how representative am
I that my experience is the DC experience!? Don't get wrong. I'm
always an advocate of individual versus some collective identity, that
I love documentaries that speaks of a person, a family, instead of an
era that had no face, no name. I believe this isn't unique to me
&amp;mdash; that's why memorials w/ rows of names, like the ones in the
&lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_England_Holocaust_Memorial"&gt;Holocaust Memorial&lt;/a&gt; in Boston, bears such a powerful message that
makes you shiver, cry, that's why &lt;a href="https://fengxia41103.github.io/myblog/funeral.html"&gt;one feels the tremendous sadness
seeing others suffer&lt;/a&gt;, at least for me. Therefore I truly applaud a
writing of an individual's story that documents the person's
journey. However, these individual stories, when being played out, had
no idea that it was typical or popular or unique or whatever. It was
100% for the person himself, but likely nothing for the statistics. I
believe they only became, iconic, after the fact, that, when looking
in hindsight, we found them &lt;strong&gt;summarized the spirit&lt;/strong&gt; so well that is
better than any playwriter could ever invent.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But now, making a title like such is, putting things in a reversed
order! &amp;rarr; we start w/ a thinking that mine is representative, and
that, is what I found it, wrong. This is, if politely, ambitious, if
bitterly, arrogant. I'm sorry. You may not represent the DC
experience. To be honest, you may not represent even your
neighbour. Period. If I were another one living in the same area and
wants to write my own diary for the experience, then what, "DC Diary
No. 2", or a revision? I think to the very least, make it "my DC
Diary", is better, so to limit the scope to your own, and leave some
space for others to share and grow.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Overall, I think these diaries have good intent, but no soul, because
there isn't an opinion, a standing point, that the author is proudly
taking.  I believe the point of writing of such isn't about
documenting a few personal events (a joke we all know is the &lt;a href="https://blog.catherinedelors.com/louis-xvi-the-royal-hunt-and-bastille-day/"&gt;Louis
XVI wrote "nothing"&lt;/a&gt; on the Bastille Day), but that you felt
something that is boiling inside you, that you would like to take
note, share or not, so that you could &lt;strong&gt;express yourself&lt;/strong&gt; in a
writing form (or if you use other means, photo, video, whatever), and
that boil, &lt;strong&gt;is emotion&lt;/strong&gt;. A &lt;em&gt;calm&lt;/em&gt; euphemism, appears to be deep, but
gives the burden of guessing to the reader, sounds smart, but, well,
you get my point (see, my version of an euphemism!!! hahaha).&lt;/p&gt;</content><category term="thoughts"></category><category term="thoughts"></category></entry><entry><title>Cart ahead of the horse</title><link href="https://fengxia41103.github.io/myblog/cart%20ahead%20of%20the%20horse.html" rel="alternate"></link><published>2020-05-01T14:16:00-04:00</published><updated>2020-05-01T14:16:00-04:00</updated><author><name>Feng Xia</name></author><id>tag:fengxia41103.github.io,2020-05-01:/myblog/cart ahead of the horse.html</id><summary type="html">&lt;figure class="col s12"&gt;

around, don't they!?) So &lt;em&gt;naturally&lt;/em&gt; I started my lecture that "you
could have said at the beginning that I couldn't finish them, and thus
cut out the portion you would finish, instead of touching food like
this towards the end. Now what are we gonna do w/ this left overs!?"
Well, whiling saying that, I was thinking loud to myself, how could
he, or anyone in that matter, know beforehand that he couldn't finish
the portion!? What about the saying that &lt;em&gt;never try, never know&lt;/em&gt;!?
Wouldn't it be reasonable, or inevitable, that he could only find out
that he can't finish this much once he is towards the end of it? The
definition that "I can't eat anymore" is that when I get to the point
when there is food left, isn't it? So, it's simply not fair of my
lecture.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But then, is this a mistake doing the lecture? If the statement "I
can't know before it happened" becomes stand, wouldn't he then get
away from anything? Seems so, doesn't it? Like his accidents, his
mischiefs, since they are all measured by their consequences, and
consequences are carts, that can only seen towards the end, thus he
legitimately can create such left overs again and again because, he
couldn't possibly know his capacity until he tries it. Doesn't sound
right either. So what am I missing?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Same for these two articles &amp;mdash; enough data and evidence will take
time to be accumulated, analyzed, and even then, there is not
guarantee that only one view (or _the view) will emerge, left alone
being agreed upon. So, can we have all waited till then to take an
action, such as this staying-at-home order, even though we don't know
either whether this is doing more harm than good? I don't know. I echo
the author's argument, but in the middle of this event, I also don't
see an alternative if I were the governor &amp;mdash; people (yeah, I'm
using this word which I dislike) demand an action, any action. This
leads me to believe the true question lies in human psych, and in this
case, the social psych &amp;mdash; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;why do people want an action asap?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Isn't it a soothing factor that is more important than its actual
   result?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Wouldn't this soothing effect itself be sufficient to justify the
   action?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Does it matter that we will &lt;em&gt;deal with the results&lt;/em&gt; later, but take
   the action now? Especially that no one can tell the result anyway,
   right (not enough evidence for or against!), so isn't taking an
   action better than being a sitting duck?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Even after some time we have evidences, wouldn't it be interpreted
   subjectively anyway, that some thinks it justifies the past action,
   while others disagree (but even so, so what!? We can't go back in
   time, and damage is done, right?)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Puzzling, isn't it? So it seems to me, one way or another is equally
valid, or equally baseless. &lt;strong&gt;In this sense the action guy will always
win, even by the fact that collecting evidence takes time, while the
power to ac is available, now!&lt;/strong&gt; Thus, I believe this pattern will
always be so, regardless what the even will be in the future. I
totally agree that letting these voices heard is critical for social
health. But I'm convinced that these voices will always not be in the
driver's seat, thus making no material difference for the ongoing
event &amp;larr; well, if so, it makes them heard even more appealing
since, they don't do any &lt;em&gt;harm&lt;/em&gt; :)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After initial contact, they modified it and sent me this. Notice that
spacing is changed to &lt;code&gt;33"&lt;/code&gt;, which makes one pole really close to the
drop down ceiling beam. This also presumes two ends will be shorter
&amp;mdash; mine was &lt;code&gt;16"&lt;/code&gt; while theirs assumes &lt;code&gt;6"&lt;/code&gt; on both ends. I think
theirs will look prettier. Since the poles are not bolted to wall
anyway, I can always arrange them differently at installation. So we
will see.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Don't like wall cabinets &amp;mdash; they are boxes on wall and so high
that they look, chunky! I don't like them a bit. Besides, top shelf
will be so high that it's not functional at all. So the entire idea of
having these cabinets so you have &lt;em&gt;plenty storage&lt;/em&gt; is just bogus to
me &amp;larr; I want something that is functional, useful to my daily
routine, and leave the space if I can't fill them up! Yes, I may put a
few picture frames there to make my eyes happy, why staring at those
boring boxes!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Today, Noah walked out the door, left, as a big fxxk you right to my
face. I'm really hurt.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The whole thing started that I prepared breakfast in the morning,
calling him coming downstairs to have breakfast. He came down in
T-shirt, walked to the screen door, "oh it's cold" (it's about 61
degrees outside), then went upstairs. I supposed he wen to grab a
sweater. Waited for a few more minutes, called him again, and from the
sound of it, I thought he went back to reading his book.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Then I got really turned off by him saying one thing and doing another
(yes we have had many conversations regarding this, but so far, no
improvement). So I went upstairs, and said that he could just dress
and go outside and play all day, and I didn't want to see him
during... and then I went back downstairs, put my food on the table,
and started eating. &lt;/p&gt;

and started eating. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After maybe 2 minutes, I went into to look for him, and he was,
gone. Mom got up, got panicked, screamed, slammed doors, rushed to her
car, and the kid was nowhere to be found. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I tried to stop her from driving in that condition because it won't be
safe. But of course, all the blame was on me. Then I searched the
neighbourhood, searched the house again, he was just nowhere to be
found.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Then came back, found a text message from his mom, that he is
found. And then she came back grabbing her wallet. I asked where he
was, and she said he walked "according to my instruction, and to
become &lt;em&gt;self-disciplined&lt;/em&gt; as I have asked him to do", without his
shoes on... so again, it's all my fault.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What a fxxxking joke!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After a few hours both came back. The kid has been hiding upstairs
without saying a word to me, without an apology, without nothing. How
typical of him, that he never had apologized for his doing! and the
mom always criticized me that I'm using the prospective of an adult to
"push him", therefore, the message is that I'm giving him too much
pressure, and I'm the problem that caused all these troubles, and his
miseries.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I'm marking this day as the official day I decided to walk away from
this kid and this family. No more. I'm hurting them as much as they
are hurting me. No more. I'll work on my place, and soon, when I move

&lt;p&gt;Through my work with the Gates Foundation, I’ve spoken with experts
and leaders in Washington and across the country. It’s become clear
to me that we must take three steps.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;First, we need a consistent nationwide approach to shutting
down. Despite urging from public health experts, some states and
counties haven’t shut down completely. In some states, beaches are
still open; in others, restaurants still serve sit-down meals.&lt;/p&gt;

down. Despite urging from public health experts, some states and
counties haven’t shut down completely. In some states, beaches are
still open; in others, restaurants still serve sit-down meals.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Even so, demand for tests will probably exceed the supply for some
time, and right now, there’s little rhyme or reason to who gets the
few that are available. As a result, we don’t have a good handle on
how many cases there are or where the virus is likely headed next,
and it will be hard to know if it rebounds later. And because of the
backlog of samples, it can take seven days for results to arrive
when we need them within 24 hours.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is why the country needs clear priorities for who is
tested. First on the list should be people in essential roles such
as health-care workers and first responders, followed by highly
symptomatic people who are most at risk of becoming seriously ill
and those who are likely to have been exposed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The same goes for masks and ventilators. Forcing 50 governors to
compete for lifesaving equipment — and hospitals to pay exorbitant
prices for it — only makes matters worse.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Finally, we need a data-based approach to developing treatments and
a vaccine. Scientists are working full speed on both; in the
meantime, leaders can help by not stoking rumors or panic
buying. Long before the drug hydroxychloroquine was approved as an
emergency treatment for covid-19, people started hoarding it, making
it hard to find for lupus patients who need it to survive.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We should stick with the process that works: Run rapid trials
involving various candidates and inform the public when the results
are in. Once we have a safe and effective treatment, we’ll need to
ensure that the first doses go to the people who need them most.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To bring the disease to an end, we’ll need a safe and effective
vaccine. If we do everything right, we could have one in less than
18 months — about the fastest a vaccine has ever been developed. But
creating a vaccine is only half the battle. To protect Americans and
people around the world, we’ll need to manufacture billions of
doses. (Without a vaccine, developing countries are at even greater
risk than wealthy ones, because it’s even harder for them to do
physical distancing and shutdowns.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We can start now by building the facilities where these vaccines
will be made. Because many of the top candidates are made using
unique equipment, we’ll have to build facilities for each of them,
knowing that some won’t get used. Private companies can’t take that
kind of risk, but the federal government can. It’s a great sign that
the administration made deals this week with at least two companies
to prepare for vaccine manufacturing. I hope more deals will follow.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In 2015, I urged world leaders in &lt;a href="https://www.ted.com/talks/bill_gates_the_next_outbreak_we_re_not_ready"&gt;a TED talk&lt;/a&gt; to prepare for a
pandemic the same way they prepare for war — by running simulations
to find the cracks in the system. As we’ve seen this year, we have a
long way to go. But I still believe that if we make the right
decisions now, informed by science, data and the experience of
medical professionals, we can save lives and get the country back to
work.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;With growing age, I guess one does become more experienced and
opinionated because you have been there, have done that, have been
pondering the topic at hand, maybe without a satisfying answer, but
must have witnessed how the debates went, how other opinions aroused
the crowd, how BS has hit the fans, and how time has proven some
right, while others, wrong &amp;larr; so that you learn along the course,
if you had kept your mind open and sensitive, even a bit agitated,
sometimes angry, sometimes applauding.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I remember back then working in Taiyuan, I started watching TED and
started speaking to junior staffs on works by the Gates Foundation,
hoping that one day they will become a member of these initiatives and
contribute their brains to them, because these are hard, much harder,
problems than what we are solving everyday at work &amp;mdash; imagine a
toilet without running water? I challenged them that if they thought
they are smart, try tackle this &amp;mdash; it was a real project posted
on the Foundation's front page, maybe quite unsexy to test (how to
test it!?), but fundamentally more valuable than yet another ERP
system w/ million dollar price tag. Case in point, my friend's
volunteer site has no indoor plumbing, no indoor toilet, well, I
should say no our idea of a toilet at atll! It's a hole in the ground
in the corner of court yard with a couple planks on top where you
squat and let the gravity takes care of the rest. Fun!? Try it in
bitter winter night, or imagine your 4-year old using that without you
holding onto his body or clothes &amp;mdash; what a fear! what a drag!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yea, so for all the smart folks out there, if you consider yourself a
good engineer, making a living w/ corporate cliche is ok, but don't
let your talent only be occupied by those. Instead, keep the brain
running w/ these types of real life challenges. We living in the US
has been to spoiled to realize that all these life convenience has
been quite recent, quite uncommon, and quite engineering savvy. For
many others, it's not the cost of appliance that kept them in a stone
age mode. It's the lack of basic infrastructure such as a running
water, or electricity, or even a paved road, that make everyday
&lt;em&gt;business&lt;/em&gt; a super hard, harder than you think, but once solved, it
benefits many, you don't need to market, no need to brag about its
benefits on pretty PPT, a changing life for the better, is the best
evidence and the best reward. &lt;/p&gt;</content><category term="thoughts"></category></entry><entry><title>Corvid-19 Summit</title><link href="https://fengxia41103.github.io/myblog/summit.html" rel="alternate"></link><published>2020-03-31T07:24:00-04:00</published><updated>2020-03-31T07:24:00-04:00</updated><author><name>Feng Xia</name></author><id>tag:fengxia41103.github.io,2020-03-31:/myblog/summit.html</id><summary type="html">&lt;p&gt;Spot a Chinese forum on Corvid-19 in WeChat, which says

&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Saw something in WeChat which truly shocked me &amp;mdash; "The 2nd Main Forum
of Corvid-19" hosted in Shanghai on March 29, 2020. Its agenda says:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;table&gt;
&lt;thead&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;th&gt;Time&lt;/th&gt;
&lt;th&gt;Description&lt;/th&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;/thead&gt;
&lt;tbody&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td&gt;15:00 - 15:03&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;Openning video&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td&gt;15:03 - 15:06&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;Openning note by the organizer&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td&gt;15:06 - 16:05&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;Forum&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td&gt;16:05 - 16:15&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;Ending note by the organizer&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;/tbody&gt;
&lt;/table&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What's in the forum:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Analysis of European Corvid-19 situation and its fatality rate&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Corvid-19 ICU patient treatment&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Analysis of challenges facing by the US&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Analysis of challenges in Asia and solutions
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;With the updated news rolled out everyday with climbing number of
patients all over the US, and the 3rd week staging at home in a
approximately lock-down of the entire country, it's rather laughable
for anyone to stand out on a forum like this as if s/he has all
figured it out &amp;mdash; far from it, I'm afraid. The entire world is in
the mist of this pandemic, and we, yes, the capital &lt;strong&gt;WE&lt;/strong&gt;, have not
yet figured it out, have not had much experience to announce a victory
in any fashion besides comforting ourselves that only that many people
have died, small number, don't worry. If any, the benefit of such
forum, or should I call it what it really is, a showoff, a brag, is to
counter a mass panic. However, I hardly read such intention from the
wording they have chosen on the poster. Even more annoyingly, it takes
time and effort to make such a poster and to organize such an event,
not to mention to first incubate such an idea when everyone else is
scraping the bottom of pants for necessities &amp;mdash; it's a sign of
leisure, and most of all, of arrogance.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What's wrong with this country, and with these people? Even the
Corvid-19 is becoming nothing but a popular topic that creates 流量，
so all the internet celebrities are attaching to it so to share the
pot before it goes cold!? Indeed Max had it right that by given 200%
profit, capitalist dares to stomp any conscience under their feet,
including their own.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is quite disturbing, and disappointing. China has evolved much
over the last 40 years in term of material wealth. However, the people
and its elites have fallen behind &amp;mdash; they have been too busy
scooping up gold in sand, and had no time to reflect, and cowardly
avoiding comparing themselves to their western peers in scope and in
depth. This, is like a shower signer enjoying himself &amp;mdash; hmmm, I
sound really good, don't I? and that's what the true spirit of this
forum.&lt;/p&gt;</content><category term="thoughts"></category></entry><entry><title>Cowardice</title><link href="https://fengxia41103.github.io/myblog/cowardice.html" rel="alternate"></link><published>2020-03-14T08:59:00-04:00</published><updated>2020-03-14T08:59:00-04:00</updated><author><name>Feng Xia</name></author><id>tag:fengxia41103.github.io,2020-03-14:/myblog/cowardice.html</id><summary type="html">&lt;figure class="col l8 m8 s12"&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So the country is entering an emergent mode. Wanted to buy paper
towels on Amazon. Wtf, out of stock. And the infamous TP
rush. Seriously. Seriously? Went to Publix for some foods. Guess what
was gone the most!? Raw meat. No kidding. The items w/ the shortest
shelf life, gone. Are you guys planning for a siege, or a weekend
party? To my biggest surprise, cereal boxes are almost all there
&amp;mdash; so much for caring for children at home, or to survive a tough
time. And there were plenty breads of all kinds, and bakery had all
kinds of cakes &amp;larr; so it will be true then, "let them eat cake" ~~~
This is a joke, a grand joke on this society, and a joke on
mankind... I guess virus has always looked at us as jokes, a group of
self-centered, self-important, ignorant organs, fooled themselves to
think that they are dominating this earth. How pathetic!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There is a true cowardice inside us, not because we are coward, but a
strong tendency of lacking courage in face …&lt;/p&gt;</summary><content type="html">&lt;figure class="col l8 m8 s12"&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There is a true cowardice inside us, not because we are coward, but a
strong tendency of lacking courage in face of aggression, or news of
others being hurt. We used to criticize German in the WWII that
neighbours watching the Jews evicted or even killed w/o doing much, we
used to criticize the Western countries not coming to help the China's
suffering from the Japanese evasion, we used to criticize anyone who
was not donating to people in Wuhan.... however, how could they not
feel that way!? when in today's event, I couldn't feel sadness
imagining families who will now run out of income, or food, or TP!
Honestly, I don't feel them at all. All we are all doing, is to be a
sitting duck in front of an even which we think we have no control
over, nothing you can do about, thus only waiting for the &lt;strong&gt;(un)lucky
draw&lt;/strong&gt; when it's your turn, my turn, or someone else's turn. That's
all we are doing, and that's all we think we can do. Is it? or there
is more?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I constantly find it annoying that I start to sense more and more of
things in ourselves, built-ins, that are the dark side of myself which
are violating every single creed on the book, yet, I'm only coming to
realize their existence, while watching others I fail to tell they
even have that epiphany &amp;mdash; and like homework, you could not
progress if you never tell your answer was wrong! Yea, mighty God, or
Buddha, or whoever, please save me, for I'm so important, see how many
TPs I have got!?..... this whole thing, is disgusting! I don't know
what to make of it. You can see what it will be like in a war time,
and truly, how ugly those time were!? Could kindness really survive,
like a flame in a gushing wind, to spread, or to be blown out? We
shall see.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At the meantime, I have some TPs left, one more paper towel rolls,
plenty of everything, books to read, Bunny by my lap, Spring flowers
blooming.... and am thinking to take a ride of the &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/U.S._Route_66"&gt;Route

&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Haven't been much a fan of Sherlock Holmes, but watched a &lt;a href="https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0988045/"&gt;movie&lt;/a&gt;,
which in the days of &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/index.html"&gt;COVID19&lt;/a&gt; all over the news and thoughts after
writing &lt;a href="https://fengxia41103.github.io/myblog/virus is coming.html"&gt;virus is coming&lt;/a&gt;, what Sherlock said made me think more on
what marks a modern man &amp;mdash; "There is no magic."&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I have ranted many times that there is no magic in engineering, in
coding, in anything that is concrete, material, real. Life itself has
no magic, it's messy, lots of loose gears fitting together, with a lot
of trial and error, and a lot of luck. So, there isn't magic in
becoming a modern man.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What is a modern man? What makes one qualified as one? I don't have
answer, nor there is any better than what I will be laying out
below. Living in the 21st century gives a perception that everyone is
now a modern man, because we are all living in a &lt;em&gt;modern&lt;/em&gt; society,
most of us at least, and cold war is over, we haven't slaughtered in a
global sense since the WWII, and more …&lt;/p&gt;</summary><content type="html">&lt;figure class="col l6 m6 s12"&gt;

most of us at least, and cold war is over, we haven't slaughtered in a
global sense since the WWII, and more people are educated w/ science,
w/ literature, w/ thinkings and philosophies and instant news and
instant gratification, from food to sex &amp;rarr; hardly one can imagine
how much faster the pace of this modern life can become &amp;larr; this,
is as efficient, as it can get. What's the next? A pill that replaces
food and drink? or one that makes you immortal? Sure. But eating a
burger is hardly much time wasting than swallowing a pill, not to
mention we eat burgers while doing other things, such as smart phone
or work or drive. So really, the trademark of a modern life, is
already here.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But, do all these make us a modern man? We all agree that a kid
growing to an age of 18 doesn't automatically makes him/her an adult
in the eyes of their parents, teachers, friends, or even
themselves. The law marks them so, but life disagrees. So the quality
of a modern man is not acquired by age either. Living in today's
world, watching TV, typing smart phones, say nothing about the state
of the mind that make the person a modern man. On the contrary, if you
watch their doings, many, I would say, fail to make the bar, and in my
mind, the bar says this:"&lt;strong&gt;Be able to step outside yourself and look
from without, so to observe what yourself just said and did, and can
still agree with them.&lt;/strong&gt;" This, isn't easy.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The reality show of this CORVID19 is a case in point. China's patients
are ramping down, and the rest of the world (this is exactly how the
company divides the markets &amp;mdash; China vs. the rest of the world,
how strange!) is ramping up. Chinese are now hailing their success,
while taking seats as if waiting for a thriller movie to start,
together with their pop corns in hand. But truly, regardless of
whether the episode has passed (which I think not). I believe all so
called 拐点 are bogus, and virus has nothing to do w/ wishful thinking
&amp;mdash; we either understand their mechanics and know how to defend,
or not. There is nothing in between, and there is no luck in
between. This is much like physics &amp;mdash; the rules have always been
there. It was human who were slow to grasp them. So we tried sun god,
Appolo, whoever driving the sun up and down, whoever makes the stars
go around in such a way. But it doesn't change them a bit, they go
around, based on the rules they have always been based on, however
human wish to explain. So will be the viruses. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So what do we do? Keep calm, don't panic, be honest, and be
kind. However, did we? did they? Didn't they have the first reaction
that the people from Wuhan were so super selfish by escaping the city,
thus spreading the virus all over my neighbourhood? Didn't they wish
to quarantine the entire city, the state, while cheering for the
government's efficiency, so called 体制的优势, and even look down
others whose authorities don't have that power!? Didn't they
themselves become victim of a peace-time war zone, so lucky for those
fans of the 抗日神剧， that they got to experience them first-hand
what it was like 90 years ago, the dreamed about 民国， or end of the
Qing, that every of them wished to go back to!? But the sad thing is,
they went around w/ heroic stories of human sacrifices, while failed
to realize what they have been cheering for, what they have been
acting against, is the exact copy of the days when 麻风（Leprosy）
patients were treated like evils, HIV patients were shunned as moral
corrupted Satan agents, and Jews were sent to ghettos then the
concentration camps because they were the &lt;em&gt;tumor of modern society&lt;/em&gt;
.... &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/Tolerance-Hendrik-Willem-Van-Loon/dp/B00085NWH0"&gt;Tolerance&lt;/a&gt;, is only possible when one is alarmed by the similarity
of these samples, by had a gut feeling of uneasiness when your own
thoughts echo these truly dark deeds that had happened in the past,
but didn't go away, and keep emerging over and over in different
disguises and slogans. If one fails to be sensitive to these signals,
one has already failed the bar to be a modern man &amp;mdash; there is no
progress, no enlightenment, when one carries all the fancy handbags,
shoes, clothes, electronics, cars, what have you, while have no feel
of the wrongs advocated by oneself.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So, as long as the hope is still about a wishful thinking such as
those bogus predictions of 拐点， of herb medicine winning the day, of
how virus has moved on to other countries as if my turn of suffering
is now over, they are not modern man. They are ancient man living in
the past.&lt;/p&gt;</content><category term="thoughts"></category><category term="thoughts"></category></entry><entry><title>Virus is coming</title><link href="https://fengxia41103.github.io/myblog/virus%20is%20coming.html" rel="alternate"></link><published>2020-03-01T12:12:00-05:00</published><updated>2020-03-01T12:12:00-05:00</updated><author><name>Feng Xia</name></author><id>tag:fengxia41103.github.io,2020-03-01:/myblog/virus is coming.html</id><summary type="html">&lt;figure class="col s12"&gt;

&lt;p&gt;News of the new virus coming to the States is all over the place now,
and the stock market has been dropping like a stone. Panic?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I haven't heard many people talking about it, life is rather running
as usual, but I think this is hanging on everyone's mind now, that we
are just waiting for a phone call from school that school is shutting
down, or an email from company that you are all required to work from
home for the next two weeks.. then what? what about food? drink?
necessities in life, gas, internet? &amp;mdash; there are so much
supports to make a modern life possible, that it's difficult to image
what it will be like when everyone, shuts down &amp;larr; even though I
felt quite annoyed by China's shutting down Wuhan city and locked down
its ten million residents on the issue of a government order, I don't

&lt;p&gt;Watched a movie made in the 1990, &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hiroshima:_Out_of_the_Ashes"&gt;Hiroshima: Out of the
Ashes&lt;/a&gt;. Sadly realistic, though I'm sure the reality back then was
ten times, a thousand times, worse. This also reminded me the book I
read which described life after the atomic bomb &amp;mdash; we outsiders
and people were not on site during those catastrophes thought of the
tragedy lasting for only the duration of the hit. But for those
survivors, it was only the beginning of their miseries. This same
theme was echoed in &lt;a href="https://www.imdb.com/title/tt6969550/"&gt;Chernobyl's café&lt;/a&gt;, that people living in that
area had no idea in that Sunday morning even when the military had
been deployed on the street measuring radiation level rising to lethal
grade. Then all of sudden, they were asked to pack and leave, in 4
hours! And? They were told the evacuation was for a few days, but they
never, ever, returned, till today, till the end of their life even,
cause the pollution of the disaster will not fade for another 250,000
years &amp;mdash; can you imagine being uprooted like that? What about my
books? my cats? my favourate so and so? Nothing was allowed to leave
except yourself and one suitcase &amp;mdash; cruel? necessary? victim of a
bureaucracy? bad luck? fate?.... I don't know how those 46,000 people
reconcile for the rest of their lives. I'm curious to learn what type
of support they were received after the uproot. But then, I'm not sure
I have the heart to hear their stories, to witness their tears, to
stand shoulder to shoulder w/ them at vigil, missing their loved ones
lost to the tragedy, harmed by it, and forever changed by it. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Saw a joke about the virus, that North Korea, being an odd ball in
today's world, announced that they had one infection, shot to death,
now their infection count, 0, hahahaha... that's a style, one way to
deal w/ this. This brings me back to my argument of the &lt;a href="https://fengxia41103.github.io/myblog/sars.html"&gt;拐点&lt;/a&gt;,
that there are endless possibilities of a virus going forward. Until
we have an understanding of its course, and this can only be done
through science, all others are nothing but wishful thinkings &amp;mdash;
I understand human must summarize, especially in such situation when
there are overwhelmingly amount of information, some truer than others
(but difficult to tell), in order to make sense so to guide his daily
action. Therefore, we need to be more sensitive of the downfall of
this tendency than usual, that by making summary out of ocean of info,
we are also risking to lose sight of the picture, and to lean more on
some than others, while these info are just random encounters to us
&amp;mdash; we are fed by some authorities and channels, while whoever has
the loudest voice gets the attention, thus the preference.&lt;/p&gt;

SARS"&lt;/a&gt; section listing its trackings in reverse chronicle order, and
interesting enough, the last line, &lt;a href="https://www.who.int/csr/don/2004_05_18a/en/"&gt;May 18, 2004&lt;/a&gt; &amp;larr; ah, talking
about going back in time, history, let's see.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now, this news, is just, disturbing! WTF!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;China’s latest SARS outbreak has been contained, but biosafety concerns remain – Update 7
18 May 2004&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It has been more than three weeks since the last case was placed in
isolation in China’s latest SARS outbreak, prompting the World
Health Organization to declare that the chain of human-to-human
transmission appears to have been broken.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;However, WHO experts and the Chinese authorities are still trying to
determine the exact cause of the outbreak. The investigation has
centred primarily on the National Institute of Virology in Beijing
where experiments using live and inactivated SARS coronavirus have
been carried out. Two researchers at the Institute developed SARS in
late March and mid-April. The outbreak was reported on April 22 and
the Institute was closed a day later.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Preliminary findings in the investigation have yet to identify a
single infectious source or single procedural error at the Institute
– and it is conceivable that an exact answer may never be
determined. Neither of the researchers is known to have directly
conducted experiments using live SARS coronavirus. However,
investigators have serious concerns about biosafety procedures at
the Institute – including how and where procedures using SARS
coronavirus were carried out, and how and where SARS coronavirus
samples were stored.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;WHO and Chinese authorities view with concern the occurrence of
laboratory-associated SARS cases. WHO urges all Member States to
view this latest outbreak as an opportunity to review the biosafety
practices of institutions and laboratories working with SARS
coronavirus.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;During and after the SARS outbreak of 2003, a large number of
specimens were collected from possible human cases, animals and the
environment. These specimens, which may contain live SARS
coronavirus, are still kept in various laboratories around the
world. Some of them are stored in laboratories at an inappropriate
containment level. SARS coronavirus has also been propagated in
reference and research laboratories, and distributed to other
laboratories for research purposes. Research using live and
inactivated SARS coronavirus – and other pathogens capable of
causing serious illness -- is being conducted in many laboratories.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;WHO has issued the following laboratory safety guidelines and
recommendations:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;• WHO biosafety guidelines for handling of SARS specimens (25 April
2003)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;• Summary of the discussion and recommendations of the SARS
laboratory workshop of 22 October 2003&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;• WHO post-outbreak biosafety guidelines for handling of SARS
coronavirus specimens and cultures (18 December 2003)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In these guidelines, WHO strongly recommends Biosafety Level 3 (BSL
3) as the minimum containment level to work with live SARS
coronavirus. WHO also urges Member States to maintain a thorough
inventory of laboratories working with and/or storing live SARS
coronavirus and to ensure that necessary biosafety standards are in
place.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;WHO commends the Chinese authorities for taking swift action to
contain the latest outbreak once it was recognized and reported, by
way of extensive contact tracing and the quarantine and medical
observation of such individuals. Once again, it has been
demonstrated that SARS is a containable disease.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So SARS was, &lt;strong&gt;speculated&lt;/strong&gt; to have come from the &lt;em&gt;National Institute
of Virology in Beijing&lt;/em&gt;, and now we all know Wuhan happened to have a
Lvl 4 Bio lab, now the whole city is locked down, and the whole world
is, worked up... coincidence!?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I think, yes? no? yes? no?... &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Btw, I'm entirely not sure about the idea of &lt;strong&gt;turning point (拐点)&lt;/strong&gt;
&amp;mdash; I mean, is this even a legitimate concept in describing a
viral outbreak!? I seriously doubt it, because it's very easy to
perceive such a thing in a simple curve. But hey, let's look at a Sine
wave, and you tell me which is the turning point!? The whole
assumption of this term lies in that once it passes the peak, it will
start to steadily decrease and approximating zero in the long run
&amp;mdash; but, isn't that a wishful thinking!? I don't think virus agree
w/ this at all, otherwise, by mathematics all viruses will be,
containable, because it is just a matter of how long this curve is
&amp;mdash; HIV takes like years, flu, 7 days (so I'm operating when Noah
gets sick), and so on... But this is just pure naive. &lt;strong&gt;Why not a curve
ever going up!? Why not a cyclical pattern like a Sine wave!? Why not
a flat line for ever and ever!?&lt;/strong&gt; What is the assumption to rule out
these patterns? and how these assumptions are proved!?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Again, this outbreak is a like an awesome reality show that everybody
is now involved, everybody has to act and react, and it's like how
human will show their true ingredients in front of a dire situation,
here we are, standing naked in front of virus, and each one acting in
a way to justify the situation and make peace w/ him/her-self. A
majority of the Chinese, from what I read and heard, are going through
a pretty clear struggle of "yes they should be shut in their houses,
otherwise they will be acting selfishly", to "I'm sacrificing my own
little convenience for a greater good", thus feeling elevated
self-pride, to "enough is enough, I'm done w/ my duty, and now let me
out and play, and if you stop me, eat my ass"... Fascinating, isn't
it?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I think shutting down the city was a sound decision. Creating panic by
not being transparent was a bad decision. Acting patriotically is
great on individual basis, but a terrible deed to be broadcasted and
even promoted on government's end. I'm glad that modern infrastructure
is able to support these many people being locked in a cage (actually,
to think about it, it's not much difference living in the city on a
common day vs. in lock down days &amp;mdash; your radius of movement is
just those few blocks, and entertainments are all at your finger tips
as long as virus doesn't attack your router or your ISP). So the
perception of anxiety is really from self-pity, sympathy, and boredom
once it lasts for too long &amp;mdash; the same logic when you wait in
line at bank for over 10 min, you grow impatience, and even angry, but
the reality is, that 10 min doesn't make a dime of difference for
99.99999% of the people (especially if you still need to go bank line
for their service ~~ if your time is that precious, trust me, bank
waits for you, not the other way around). It's just a psychological
thing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Anyway. I feel sorry for people who are going through this. I
constantly think this is a man made, disaster, not that its origin is
man made (that is going to be a conspiracy theory for many years to
come), but the way we handle it, and the way we live through it
&amp;mdash; like war, not that all die and no one lives through it &amp;mdash;
millions did survive.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But, who wants to go back and relive those days, again!?&lt;/p&gt;</content><category term="thoughts"></category><category term="thoughts"></category></entry><entry><title>Burden of proof</title><link href="https://fengxia41103.github.io/myblog/burden%20of%20proof.html" rel="alternate"></link><published>2020-02-18T08:29:00-05:00</published><updated>2020-02-18T08:29:00-05:00</updated><author><name>Feng Xia</name></author><id>tag:fengxia41103.github.io,2020-02-18:/myblog/burden of proof.html</id><summary type="html">&lt;figure class="col s12"&gt;
  &lt;img src="images/burden%20of%20proof.jpg"/&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Had a chat w/ a friend yesterday after he showed a snippet of his chat
history, rather more accurately, of his argument history, w/ someone
in his circle about the ongoing corona virus outbreak. The argument
goes something like this:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yao: The traditional Chinese medicine is useless.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;B: What is your job? (Implying, are you a doc?)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yao: I'm a nobody, certainly not a medical personnel.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;B: Then you have no qualification to make such a claim.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yao: This is absurd. Why can't I have an opinion even if I had no
medical training?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;B: Cause you don't know what you are talking about.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So it goes on and on and on....&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is interesting, and actually quite common pattern that I have
witnessed over and over in chats, especially among Chinese. I sense
there is a logic flaw in this pattern, but haven't given it much
thought what this flaw is. But a word suddenly came to me &amp;mdash; 举证
倒置 (&lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reverse_onus"&gt;reverse onus&lt;/a&gt;), meaning to shift the burden of proof to the
party …&lt;/p&gt;</summary><content type="html">&lt;figure class="col s12"&gt;

there is a logic flaw in this pattern, but haven't given it much
thought what this flaw is. But a word suddenly came to me &amp;mdash; 举证
倒置 (&lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reverse_onus"&gt;reverse onus&lt;/a&gt;), meaning to shift the burden of proof to the
party who is being challenged &amp;rarr; but, in a common sense, I would
expect the challenger to provide the evidence to support the
challenge. After all, I thought I was right, it's you, the challenger,
who is disagreeing w/ me. So why should I bother to prove myself
correct, again!? Wouldn't it even be super biased even if I &lt;em&gt;do&lt;/em&gt;!?
&amp;larr; that's where it smells funny, isn't it! &amp;mdash; I was told at
some point that this is the foundation of Chinese law, which
essentially assumes you guilty, and it is up to the defendant to prove
him/herself innocent; on the contrary, the US law assumes you
innocent, and it is up to the challenger (the plaintiff) to provide
evidence that you are guilty (that is his/her position, isn't it!?).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A reverse onus clause is a provision within a statute that shifts the
burden of proof onto the individual specified to disprove an element
of the information. Typically, this provision concerns a shift in
burden onto a defendant in either a criminal offence or tort claim. 
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Can't find much of this term beyond the legal application. So googled
a bit more, and found that in philosophy, this is called &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Burden_of_proof_(philosophy)"&gt;burden of
proof&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When two parties are in a discussion and one makes a claim that the
other disputes, the one who makes the claim typically has a burden of
proof to justify or substantiate that claim especially when it
challenges a perceived status quo.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So in both terms, applying to such debate pattern, it means the
challenger, the B in this case, is making a challenge to Y's claim
that the "traditional Chinese medicine is useless", thus it's him/her
obligation to provide evidence/proof for the challenge.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;However, apparently something didn't go right, when B immediately
questioned whether Y has medical training, thus if Y fails to &lt;strong&gt;prove
his credibility w/ proper domain knowledge&lt;/strong&gt; (and this is a very shaky
ask since, first of all, there is no agreement of definition of this
qualification, second, approval of satisfaction of meeting the
qualification lies now in the hand of the challenger! This is the most
questionable aspect of this pattern!) leading down the path that you
claim itself is questionable if you don't have adequate training. What
went wrong!? .... hmmm.. what's going on here? Two things are mixing
up in this debate now, both, well, by my evaluation, are fallacies on
B's part  &amp;mdash; the &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Argument_from_ignorance"&gt;argument from ignorance&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ad_hominem"&gt;Ad
hominem&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;argument from ignorance&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;First, the &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Argument_from_ignorance"&gt;argument from ignorance&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Argument from ignorance (from Latin: argumentum ad ignorantiam), also
known as appeal to ignorance (in which ignorance represents "a lack of
contrary evidence"), is a fallacy in informal logic. It asserts that a
proposition is true because it has not yet been proven false or a
proposition is false because it has not yet been proven true. This
represents a type of false dichotomy in that it excludes the
possibility that there may have been an insufficient investigation to
prove that the proposition is either true or false. It also does not
allow for the possibility that the answer is unknowable, only knowable
in the future, or neither completely true nor completely false. In
debates, appeals to ignorance are sometimes used in an attempt to
shift the burden of proof.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A bit hard to read and digest. So let me use a couple common patterns
you would hear from a Chinese medicine lover:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;false positive&lt;/strong&gt;: I took a Chinese medicine and now my symptoms are completely gone. The medicine cured my symptoms.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;absence of evidence&lt;/strong&gt;: There is no evidence of Chinese medicine
   causing harm, and therefore, it must be unharmful (or even
   helpful).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I bet these sound familiar to your ears. But then, wouldn't these also
apply to Y's claim that the medicine is useless!? I mean, he can't
conclude it's useless because it &lt;em&gt;didn't work in one case&lt;/em&gt; (the false
positive), or that &lt;em&gt;didn't work because I can't iterate an example
when it worked&lt;/em&gt; (absence of evidence &amp;rarr; he may not be knowledge
enough of cases when it worked! thus bringing the question of his
professional training as a challenge)!?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Sounds so, doesn't it! Meaning both parties are offenders of this
fallacy by shifting the burden of proof to the other party. But, is it
so? If this is the case, then whoever speaks first (thus stating
his/her opinion) is liable to provide evidence (I think they should),
but will be automatically in a position of playing defense, and since
this is an opinion vs. opinion, no sufficient proof can be provided if
the other party has taken the position to reject this first claim!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On top of this, there is the difficulty of &lt;strong&gt;proving a negative&lt;/strong&gt;. As
in this case Y's claiming that the medicine is useless (a negative)
requires him to proof it never worked, which apparently, is not true
(as before the modern medicine, these traditional ones had to play a
part in healing people, whether it worked by chance or by practice,
thus must have successful cases to support its being useful).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A negative claim is a colloquialism for an affirmative claim that
asserts the non-existence or exclusion of something.[10] The
difference with a positive claim is that it takes only a single
example to demonstrate such a positive assertion ("there is a chair
in this room," requires pointing to a single chair), while the
inability to give examples demonstrates that the speaker has not yet
found or noticed examples rather than demonstrates that no examples
exist (the negative claim that a species is extinct may be disproved
by a single surviving example or proven with omniscience).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;Ad hominem&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Doesn't a Latin just add, weight, to the credibility of what I'm going
to say!?... hahaha... don't be fooled by it, just that don't be fooled
by anything just because it is printed in a capital letter or on
paper. Keep up your curiosity and hope you can still follow my lines
so far. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ad_hominem"&gt;Ad hominem&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;refers to a fallacious argumentative strategy whereby genuine
discussion of the topic at hand is avoided by instead attacking the
character, motive, or other attribute of the person making the
argument, or persons associated with the argument, rather than
attacking the substance of the argument itself.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here we see the exact strategy (a fallacy) that B has deployed in this
argument, by questioning Y's &lt;em&gt;medical training&lt;/em&gt; &amp;mdash; this is the
most prevalent pattern you will observe in Chinese, both the online
&lt;em&gt;verbal assaults&lt;/em&gt; between a fan club and their foes, or historically
how they tarnish someone during the Cultural Revolution era &amp;mdash;
once they prove you are a bad person (only in a moral sense, and the
moral standard, of course, if held by the winner, usually the one who
has the biggest fist or the loudest voice), they conclude that
everything of you is now nonworthy!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;summary&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So now by examining the debate, there are two problems:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On Y's part, he has to seek a different route to prove the
   negative. I don't know how and what it is, but there must be a way
   to do so. Otherwise, the negatives will be un-defeatible!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On B's part, he attacked Y's credential instead of his claim, which
   is &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ad_hominem"&gt;Ad hominem&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now, I'm interested in know, why there are so many argument fallacies
in these common daily exchange of opinions? and how could people, who
are not a student of philosophy, be able to guard themselves against
them? Is there really a pattern that we can express the opinions
freely, while not falling into these traps? And further, don't be an
offender myself?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I have stated a thought on heroes in a &lt;a href="https://fengxia41103.github.io/myblog/coronavirus.html"&gt;previous article&lt;/a&gt;. However,
after browsing the Wechat and saw all the posts of videos and articles
on cities sending medical teams to Hubei or Wuhan on a heroic trip as
if sending troops to the frontline, I have been thinking twice about
this word &amp;mdash; heroes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What are they? Are they commoners, who just got unlucky, caught by a
moment of history, that his/her saying turned out to be a reality,
thus they are now hailed as a prophet &amp;rarr; a smaller figure of God,
but a greater figure of human? Saw the news of Dr. Li's death
yesterday was heartbreaking. I felt I wanted to say something,
something nice about this person, something, showing off the bright
side of me, that I care, that I'm angry at the reality, that I have a
tender heart towards his tragedy .... but you see, everything I'm
laying out here, starts with an "I". &lt;strong&gt;The news was all over the
platform for exactly one day. One day!&lt;/strong&gt; &amp;rarr; Wechat is indeed …&lt;/p&gt;</summary><content type="html">&lt;figure class="col s12"&gt;

platform for exactly one day. One day!&lt;/strong&gt; &amp;rarr; Wechat is indeed a
mirror of the modern Chinese mentality: short memory, short attention
span, even for heroes &amp;larr; Li never dreamed of his fate ending like
this, not even when he sounded &lt;em&gt;alarm&lt;/em&gt;, which at the time was nothing
more than a personal opinion that was a fable voice among million of
other loud shouts online &amp;mdash; honestly, who cares!?  who cared!? He
was not a hero, and I truly wish he isn't one now, either, because
being one is not fun &amp;mdash; you don't choose to become one, you are
made to become one.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Why do people hail a hero? Do they really respect them? Admire them?
Want to become them? So many would say, of course. But not
really. Let's be honest w/ ourselves. Do you want to be a hero? Like
Dr. Li? If given the opportunity of rolling back in time and swap him
out w/ you, will you!? I won't, not if I know it's death waiting for
me at the other end, in what, 20 days!? By setting up a statue of him,
width:100%;all of us can now hide in the shadow of his figure, as if we are in
line with his thinking and his doing, but is only to avoid facing our
own cowardice, facing the reality of his actually not-so-inevitable
fate, and facing to challenge the status quo, that, if perpetuated,
will one day make one of us, another hero, in this same fashion &amp;larr;
we all know it is going to happen, just don't know who is going to win
that lottery. We hail hero as if a tribe is chanting a song to their
sacrifice, and lavishly slapping a crown of honor in their name only
to justify our own guilt. What a shame! We need that shadow to cover
us all, the larger, the better.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;To think of it, I don't want to be hero; I don't want anyone I know to
become a hero; I don't want to run into a hero in my daily routine as
they were becoming so many by being mass produced by a systematic
method. No!&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I want to live in a place and time that commoners live their selfish
lives and bicker over their daily nuances as their most agonizing
experience, feel a broken heart from a breakup, struggle with daily
chores or a terrible boss/job, live unhappily as these tiny little
things annoy the hell out of them... but not any historical moment in
book, whether from the past or from the future, that is said to
witness the grandness of time, of achievement, of progress, of turning
point, of achieving the unachievable, of proving us once more
overcoming a surmount peril... no, none of these! Because grand era
calls for great sacrifices, the one who actually moved the needle
never knew s/he was making the history &amp;mash; they were caught by it,
thus is a tragedy; the one who were the sacrifices, had been proven
over and over and over again, would never bring rain, or peace, or
God's favor, as planned. They are less than a tragedy; they are wasted
by ignorance, by arrogance, by bureaucracy, by propaganda, by anything
except your own will.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What would I do if I were to send a group of people going to war, or
to Wuhan? No camera. No flower. No crowd. Family and friends only, if
they want to say farewell. I will watch them go by, if can be, one by
one, as slow as it permits, and try to print down in my brain as much
as I can, their faces, their voices, who they shaked hands, whom they
hugged the longest time... Yes, bring a camera for that matter, so to
remember all these &amp;mdash; it is not a witness of glory, but a witness
of incompetence and of shame, and I will watch over and over and over
again, in private, only alone, so I could now cry, as hard as I can,
as I owe them not only tears, but so much that I will never be able to
compensate, to reconcile. &lt;/p&gt;</content><category term="thoughts"></category><category term="thoughts"></category></entry><entry><title>Coronavirus</title><link href="https://fengxia41103.github.io/myblog/coronavirus.html" rel="alternate"></link><published>2020-02-09T07:20:00-05:00</published><updated>2020-02-09T07:20:00-05:00</updated><author><name>Feng Xia</name></author><id>tag:fengxia41103.github.io,2020-02-09:/myblog/coronavirus.html</id><summary type="html">&lt;figure class="col s12"&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The entire episode of 2020 Coronavirus is an ugly reality show. The
poor Dr. Li died, and it's really sad, and ugly, an ugly truth that a
hero was not born to be one; rather, they were becoming one by pure
accident because they stepped forward, unknowingly,  becoming &lt;em&gt;out of
line&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;em&gt;standing out&lt;/em&gt; among the crowd, at the &lt;em&gt;wrong&lt;/em&gt; time when a wave
of collapse was to sweep through.... Li didn't foresee the scale of
this epidemic; he is not a God. I don't believe anyone did, including
the scolded Wuhan mayor who "should have taken this more seriously"
&amp;mdash; nonsense!! Li, practically speaking, is a hero not because of
his prediction, but because of a mass sentiments brewing in the
background who are so fed up by the official bureaucracy and its
&lt;strong&gt;child-like reaction&lt;/strong&gt;, that they need one spokeman, an icon, an
image, to shout their minds in a safe distance &amp;mdash; and when this
&lt;em&gt;hero&lt;/em&gt; is in past tense, so the more convenient.&lt;/p&gt;

back for too long?"&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We, myself, and billion others, are only hiding behind hero's
back. Not only so. To justify our feeble attempt, we, on the one hand,
make an altar for our hero, putting their photos up high, as a sign of
respect; on the other, we turn to the cause of the misery, not to
scold its maker and feel disgusted by it, but instead, searching a
justification in the pile of debris &amp;mdash; that's when a glass bead
is said to be as shining as a diamond, and is as worthy as one, too.&lt;/p&gt;</content><category term="thoughts"></category><category term="thoughts"></category></entry><entry><title>Bucharest</title><link href="https://fengxia41103.github.io/myblog/bucharest.html" rel="alternate"></link><published>2020-01-26T11:55:00-05:00</published><updated>2020-01-26T11:55:00-05:00</updated><author><name>Feng Xia</name></author><id>tag:fengxia41103.github.io,2020-01-26:/myblog/bucharest.html</id><summary type="html">&lt;figure class="col s12"&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Luck to have this business trip and jumped on it at the last
minute. Even luckier that I switched seat on the way here at the last
moment, literally, when I found out I were going to seat next to
someone I didn't want to entertain, and it worked out quite nicely ~~&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Didn't know what to expect, except that I'm very much curious of the
country and wanted to check it out. And the most impressive thing I
found, people!! The people are just simply, beautiful, I mean,
cosmetically, by their looks!! It's rather stunning that so many guys
have grown big mustache, young and old, and boy, don't they have a
style!! So many of them walking in that fancy mall next our office
look like Beckham!! No kidding.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And don't even get me started on girls &amp;mdash; they are simply,
gorgeous! Every one of them is like 6ft tall, long straight legs,
beautiful beautiful hair, and the face! Oh, my, God! I took a random
bus from Downtown yesterday after walking for so long …&lt;/p&gt;</summary><content type="html">&lt;figure class="col s12"&gt;

gorgeous! Every one of them is like 6ft tall, long straight legs,
beautiful beautiful hair, and the face! Oh, my, God! I took a random
bus from Downtown yesterday after walking for so long and got really
tired. So hopped on Route 335 which took me all the way to this giant
mega mall, which is the perfect spot for people watching. And let me
tell you, you walk around in the mall, and once a while, I mean, like
every 30 seconds, you get a girl walking towards you or one you see in
a distance, and honestly, my heart just &lt;strong&gt;skipped a beat&lt;/strong&gt;!!! No
kidding!! They are incredibly, goddess like!! And many many many of
them have a really cool way to dress. Talking about 文艺青年， I
bumped into a random street yesterday, and everyone I ran into, had
this cool style, guys and girls, and the type of style looked, so
natural on them, that I started to realize that this isn't really a
style, per se, for them, but just their ordinary way of dressing
&amp;mdash; not fancy, because the whole country in general, is pretty
poor, but because they possess such a tall body and cute face, that
this style simply works.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And buildings. I have never been other part of Europe, so have no
reference. I have to say, the big block buildings, whether it's a
Roman style, or Communist concrete squares, are just magnificent! The
scale, the way it conveys its message, and the facades!!! I can't
imagine how they can produce, and be willing to decorate all
buildings, whether it's a palace, or a church, or just a residential
place, w/ soooooo many facades!!!! So many!!! It's simply incredible
how much extra work doing this must have added, all for, appealing the
eyes!!! Bravo!! Really. I always say that you need to live a in
beautiful place and surrounded by beautiful people and things, because
it's like a training to your eyes and your mind &amp;mdash; the look, the
way, all become a part of yourself, even when you write code, not to
mention, when you dress, when you buy clothes, when you look for a
wife ~~ and this city has plenty beauty to offer, overwhelmingly so. I
love it!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Then, regardless so many nice looking buildings around, many many many
of them, I'm talking about like streets and streets and streets of
them, are in such a poor condition, that I didn't see a single soul
living there! Most of the street level units are definitely not
occupied at all &amp;mdash; broken windows, boarded doors, graffeti
everywhere!! I don't know how to describe this feeling when you were
talking in them &amp;mdash; it's like the entire city was in foreclosure,
in a massive massive scale! It's simply mind boggling to witness how
such a beautiful country/city are like this, when their beautiful
women probably live in this, when they have such a potential, and if
given a chance, they deserve so much more than what they have!!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I don't know why so, I don't know whether a change is coming, or
possible? I suppose everything is about politics, and there must be a
reason these places are so not maintained. Nonetheless, I wish this
country, and their people, a bright future, a wealthy economy, a
comfortable life, so to match their good looking citizens. Really,
sincerely.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Went to check out the train station yesterday. It got me curious after
the young guys in the team said that they would receive packages from
home when they were in college, &lt;strong&gt;and every week&lt;/strong&gt; !!!! According to
them, there is no cafeteria, no place to cook, and the dorms are sooo
darn cheap that they had to live off their mom's cooking sent by the
train or bus via the conductors, &lt;strong&gt;every single week&lt;/strong&gt;!! This felt
literally, like a long military supply line, in peace time, for
college kids!! How fascinating!! I wanted to check it out, and was
genuinely expecting a large group of young looking college kids being
there to pick up their stuff. But well, not exactly a large busy train
terminals, more like the same size and look of Boston's commuter
rails, almost the same size as the South Station, I would say. And get
this, the only few trains I saw either departing or were waiting, had
only 4 carriages!! It's really really short! and the platform? Was
long!! Like designed for 30+ carriages, but the only thing
running? 4. Hahaha.... interesting!? I don't know why, and I didn't
really see any mass move of picking up packages kind of deal. Maybe
it's Sunday? I don't know. I just found it rather unsustainable,
right, that you, as a young hungry college person, would have to live
off a long supply line from home, every week, or what? Starve to
death? Man, that's something, isn't it!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Then walking around from the train station, bumped right into a local
grocery farmer's market, and picked up the best meal I had in
Bucharest from an open BBQ stall &amp;mdash; no one there speaks a word of
english! Luckily a guy waiting in line was able to speak some, and he
helped me to get my order in. It took me a bit hand wavings to order
my wine (and Romanian word for it sounds like &lt;code&gt;win&lt;/code&gt;!! Pretty
close.). Sitting in this, plastic tents across to the BBQ grills,
among a few tables of old local guys, the food felt incredibly
delicious, and excellent!! For 25 Lei (the local currency of about 4:1
to USD), this is a treat ~~~ Later, two old guys walked in the tent,
and couldn't find a seat to sit. So I waved them to join my
table. There I was, sitting w/ two guys, whom I felt like walking off
a Romanian movies &amp;mdash; I don't know why, every single old man I saw
here make me to think that he is a train conductor!!! hahaha... I
guess that's the most frequent appeared roles in those Romanian WWII
movies, you know, a white haired train conductor who is also an
underground fighter.... it's just a very interesting feeling sitting
there, watching them talking, they ignored me, and I didn't understand
a word what they said.... actually, the guy sitting across me looked
like a college professor in US, very cool looking I would say, for his
age... sigh, if only I could get old looking like that... let's wish
for it ~~ &lt;/p&gt;</content><category term="thoughts"></category><category term="thoughts"></category></entry><entry><title>Beautiful voice</title><link href="https://fengxia41103.github.io/myblog/beautiful%20voice.html" rel="alternate"></link><published>2020-01-06T12:23:00-05:00</published><updated>2020-01-06T12:23:00-05:00</updated><author><name>Feng Xia</name></author><id>tag:fengxia41103.github.io,2020-01-06:/myblog/beautiful voice.html</id><summary type="html">&lt;p&gt;你是, 夜空中最亮的星&lt;/p&gt;</summary><content type="html">&lt;p&gt;What a beautiful song, and beautiful voices! &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yes, we have all been there &amp;mdash; pure, pure thoughts, pure mind,
pure voices, pure emotion, pure love and hate, pure like and dislike,
honest, sincere, having integrity. When did we lose them? when? Like
pearls along the way, we let them lose and couldn't now find them
anymore, not only that we could not back track the same path we came,
but they, like those magic gems, once dropped, will disappear into the
ground, gone, forever.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It is a strange feeling. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Waiting for the shuttle bus, and bumped into a new group of interns on
their first day &amp;mdash; young, fresh, lively, full of curiosity,
expectation, and maybe hope. The sun shined through a girls hair,
looking like threads w/ waving in the wind, bright, color of life.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Woke up suddenly this morning. Last day of 2019, last day of staying
w/ Dad, going home again. I missed you, very very much. Waking w/ a
mind of you, don't remember now what you were doing in my dream, but
it was you, and only you, could wake me like that. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Wrote you a letter, maybe I will paste it here later. Sitting on the
taxi coming over, music played a tune that, together with the car
zipping through this city and the morning traffic, with the sun, the
cold air, the strange silence in my heart, fit, like a movie scene. I
almost cried, but it's ok, I felt you, felt myself leaving you, and
that feeling ah, took all myself, away.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I wished I could make my thoughts, all these thoughts of you, into a
movie, someday, that I will play this music at this moment, that I'm
letting it go, finally, letting it go, I can't hold on to you any
longer, if indeed you were a kite, now I am cutting the string... fly,
fly, my love, fly, but remember, I'm here, and when you are tired,
when you are hurt, come back, I'm here, I'll make you laugh, will heal
your wound, and you can fly out again. That's all I want to be, that's
all I can do, that's all I can do, for you.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I love you, with all my heart, with all my soul.&lt;/p&gt;

又惊醒了……嗯嗯，不了不了，不打扰了，最后一次了，你说过要相望于江湖，我

也得这样。若你哪天玩累了，或是又会想起我这个糟大叔，那就来找我吧，你若
有伤，我养，你若有娃，我养，你若容颜不在，我养。我的生活充满荆棘，我不
要拉着你和我闯关。但我有十二分的勇气，如果是为了你，和这个世界开战。不
打扰了不打扰了，无论你在哪儿，只要你唤我，刀山火海，我必来。我爱你，也
非常想你，但不能这样再这样了。小孟昨天告诉我，她联系了你，这孩子也是傻，
这次去太原看看她和那会儿做项目的同事，还有甲方，聊到电视剧东京女子图鉴，
我说我写了个观后感发给你看，结果，她看了我的网站，说失眠了一夜，都当妈
的人了，吓了我一跳，她最终猜到了是你，是想帮我解这个心吧，但其实，你这
么聪明，又哪会不知道怎么解呢？原谅她的莽撞吧，她好心，都是我给你带了这
些困扰，记在我的账上吧，如果我还有机会还。走了走了……记得，纵海角天涯，
我虽未能陪在你身边，我把心分了四份，一份在上海，一份在成都，一份在会理，
再一份我留给娃娃，你在的地方，我的心都在，我的念都在，我怕没了你的消息，
也请答应我，你难过了，悲伤了，不开心了，记得找我，我哄你开心，让你再飞。
美丽的人那，记得要美丽，记得不害怕，记得有我～～&lt;/p&gt;

嗯嗯，在去机场的路上了，他刚睡下…傻瓜，别说傻话，你没有影响我的生活，
你让我看见了这世界最美丽的一个姑娘，那，世界剩下的一切，都只会是暗淡失

&lt;p&gt;It must be how a king feels like, by sitting at airport, maybe sipping
a cup of Starbucks, and just watching people walking by &amp;mdash; isn't
it exactly the emperor's dream, that to have all the women in the city
walking right in front his eyes, so to pick/judge the one he likes!?
That's exactly how I felt when I was doing that ~~ But then, it isn't
a privilege a king has, right, I mean, you could just get a stool, and
sit by a curb in a city, and watch people going by like that
also.. But there is sth about airport, you can see how much effort a
woman puts in &amp;mdash; the dress, the shoes, the accessories, the air
she puts on, essentially, the image she is trying to leave to all
these strangers around her, interesting!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This makes me wonder, that being a super model must be extremely,
&lt;strong&gt;uncomfortable&lt;/strong&gt; &amp;mdash; after all, I think nobody in his/her common
sense will/should comfortable walking in front of some eyes whose sole
purpose is …&lt;/p&gt;</summary><content type="html">&lt;figure class="col s12"&gt;

&lt;strong&gt;uncomfortable&lt;/strong&gt; &amp;mdash; after all, I think nobody in his/her common
sense will/should comfortable walking in front of some eyes whose sole
purpose is to watch him/her walking by, and on top of all these, the
models have to wear, well, nearly nothing, sometimes, and that must
take quite some guts to do so, and don't feel bad about him/her-self!
I don't know, maybe that's why super models all have low self-esteem,
and little self-confidence? So, no one is like to be watched, or
judged, even though, everyone knows, we are being judged, being
scrutinized, being compared, being watched, being always a person in
others' eyes, isn't this an irony!?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I like the ones who have nothing to pretend, but wearing the same
stuff that you can tell belongs to him/her, and sometimes even a bit
out of scene that they drag on a few things which don't belong to the
glass windows, granite floors, attendants in uniforms, but then, they
were just minding their own business, trying to figure out their ways,
in this confusing place &amp;mdash; it is indeed a confusing place,
everytime I travel, I have to feel, anxious, feel uneasy, feel,
uncertain. Maybe it's just the crowd that makes me, nervous. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Or, maybe, it's just the feeling of leaving, leaving a place, again,
that makes me, a bit, sentimental. I finally figured out, about
travels &amp;mdash; I don't think I will like it at all, not when it lasts
over, say, a month &amp;larr; there are a lot to take care of if you are
hopping from city to city &amp;mdash; transportation, lodging, food, maybe
a few places you overhear and want to visit now, or a thing you saw
in a store that you want to carry w/ you, but then, thinking about how
many stops you still have, and the luggage you have to drag along,
that you let it go in the end &amp;mdash; I think only when travels are
all arranged, that you will find it, enjoyable, maybe. But then,
doesn't it defeat the purpose of travel altogether!? I think so. It is
the uncertainty, the get away, that makes a travel, interesting, not a
fixed schedule, a known agenda, a sure plan.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But hopping on the road at a random will is a bit, demanding. I liked
it, not because it was fun, but I had a place in mind, which I have to
go, and see. To me, it's not a travel, a trip, but rather, is the only
way, to settle, with myself. &lt;/p&gt;</content><category term="thoughts"></category><category term="thoughts"></category></entry><entry><title>Late night, city</title><link href="https://fengxia41103.github.io/myblog/late%20night%20city.html" rel="alternate"></link><published>2019-12-22T23:51:00-05:00</published><updated>2019-12-22T23:51:00-05:00</updated><author><name>Feng Xia</name></author><id>tag:fengxia41103.github.io,2019-12-22:/myblog/late night city.html</id><summary type="html">&lt;figure class="col s12"&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When was the last time I was sitting by a window watching a city going
to sleep? Was it 2012 when I took Noah to Japan for the first time,
that I was sitting there, watching the city sleep, watching the city
wake up? Then, I was writing emails to Noah's mom, hoping the words
will get to her. But then, they never get responses, so the story
ended, w/ a sad ending, as expected.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now, I'm sitting at a window again, watching the city lights going out
here and there, less noise on the street, less cars going by, and
families of the building next become dark as ppl are also turning off
lights at home to go to sleep &amp;mdash; so here I am, ready to fly again
tomorrow, but sitting here, watching, writing, thinking. I tried to
feel you these days, but honestly, after spending time in your city, I
started to feel, less now of the memories &amp;mdash; I still wish you
could be next to me, someday, but I can't feel what …&lt;/p&gt;</summary><content type="html">&lt;figure class="col s12"&gt;

started to feel, less now of the memories &amp;mdash; I still wish you
could be next to me, someday, but I can't feel what is like anymore,
just a thought, less emotional now, at least for now, it is so.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Sitting at a square nearby in the evening and watched people square
dance. Fascinating. Especially there was this woman, can't see her
face, all dressed up, in a really elegant way, just standing there,
still, and her (I guess) boyfriend who has a beer belly, was leading a
group of enthusiasts, dance to a loud tune. Can't really say he dances
well; but she looks quite striking from behind, especially in the
middle of these loudness, dim lights, and happy hours.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There was a large circle, probably 50 people or even more, some
dressed in what I would guess 彝族 costumes, moving in one direction
w/ rhythmic kicks, beats, and some singings. Watching them going by as
if they were gathering around a bonfire at their village, I couldn't
help feeling touched by the rough spirits they possessed, however
unpolished it may be, it was down to earth, plain, and
touching. Looking at their faces and attires, I can't tell what they
do during day, or whether they are really  彝族, or they were just
having a good time. Was it a dating theme, that they were checking
each other out? Or just a chance to grab a stranger's hands, or being
nudged to each other w/o feeling embarrassed or annoyed? was it, their
form of a, hug? Maybe so, maybe so. Whatever it is, it is a human
need, that everyone wants to feel close to someone, wants to jump and
kick and sweat, wants to sing and dance, wants to beat to a beat,
wants to feel, real, alive &amp;mdash; there it goes, a middle age guy was
just invited by his friend to join the dance circle, immediately he
was mixing into the same move like everybody else! How interesting!
Apparently he is not new to this, but then, when he was just standing
next to me, I would never tell!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So I watched, watched, not that the music was pleasing, but there were
people in it, and like a place, people, give it, a soul.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Went back to the boutique coffee shop tonight after a full dinner,
feeling I wanted to pay it another visit before leaving town
tomorrow. However, it's was rather a disappointing experience &amp;mdash;
so there were these two women ahead of me, who got their fancy coffee
also, and they started doing some kind of astrology-kind show while I
was waiting for mine &amp;mdash; one apparently was a main speaker, whose
topic of the night was number 7, and she just started talking talking,
"people whose number 7 is detail oriented, curious, and lucky....." I
turned around to check her out, since she was quite fluent, I thought
she might be reading something, but no, she was just talking to her
phone! So it got me quite annoyed, that her head actually has this
kind of stuff coming out naturally.... and the worst part, is the
other woman smoked while I was served my coffee, so not only I dont
like smoke, but that it masked my coffee taste.. sigh. I wanted to say
something to them, but then, well, I'd better be a stranger, and let
them do what they do, cause I really don't want to ask further their
topic, or their interests in coming to this shop &amp;mdash; if you were
here for coffee, I'm sure you didn't appreciate the air that used to
be mixed w/ coffee bean smell and chocolate, but now, there was
nothing but a cigarette smell. What a bad idea!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Walked to the bookstore I found. Quite a nice place. Yes there were
also young girls and guys taking photos (girls are taking poses, while
one guy is shining lights using his phone, and another w/ a big ass
lens and camera). Pretty bogus, isn't it!? It's ok. They need this
setting, so to prove how cool they are, how cultural they are &amp;mdash;
however one doesn't like read books at all, books printed on paper,
sitting on shelves, still spell out a status no other shining goodies
can compete &amp;mdash; same as the rudimentary music the square dances
had, books, as plain as they are, touches a person, a mysterious
power, isn't it?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I don't know you will ever be here, in this store, or taking that
coffee. I'm sure you have seen much better ones. But it's ok. These
are just places, moments, thoughts, that make me think of you, even
though you were not here &amp;mdash; when I felt sad, felt moved, felt
happy, felt forgotten, felt alone, I always wished, you would know.&lt;/p&gt;</content><category term="thoughts"></category><category term="love"></category></entry><entry><title>Mask, and random clips</title><link href="https://fengxia41103.github.io/myblog/mask.html" rel="alternate"></link><published>2019-12-21T20:25:00-05:00</published><updated>2019-12-21T20:25:00-05:00</updated><author><name>Feng Xia</name></author><id>tag:fengxia41103.github.io,2019-12-21:/myblog/mask.html</id><summary type="html">&lt;figure class="col s12"&gt;

&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I wonder, whether human feels deep inside an urge, to hide behind a
mask, some sort of &lt;em&gt;shield&lt;/em&gt;, so to feel, safe, feel privileged among
peers, feel self-confident?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you notice, the premium spot of any coffee shop, is always the big
glass window facing outside, while you can sip your coffee, or just
sit there idling, while people watching, and while, maybe, be watched
by people going by. Why so? Why do we want to hide behind a glass
shield? From the inside, it feels that you are outside this world
looking in; but standing outside, don't you also become a fish in a
tank, quite pathetic in a box feeling good about yourself? I don't
know, but I find it to be very much true, to myself, as well as to
many many others &amp;larr; we like to sit by the window, to watch people,
and to be watched, and the drink, the price tag, the environment, all
become something standing behind me, so to make me feel, above the
ones outside &amp;mdash; and even …&lt;/p&gt;</summary><content type="html">&lt;figure class="col s12"&gt;

become something standing behind me, so to make me feel, above the
ones outside &amp;mdash; and even so, that me having the luxury to sit
down, to relax, to kill time, while people walking by, well, are,
walking, are &lt;em&gt;occupied&lt;/em&gt; physically, so that adds another layer of
icing on the peer victory, doesn't it!?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;How interesting! Then, along this line, all of sudden you start to
find a lot of masks. Another common one besides glass window:
&lt;strong&gt;sunglass&lt;/strong&gt; &amp;mdash; wearing sunglass is always more than functional
&amp;mdash; you feel, somehow, safe, behind these shades, even though they
hide nothing but some eyes, while 99% of your body is exposed, but you
think you are different, invisible &amp;mdash; in a sense, the eyes don't
have direct contact, thus others can't just peek into your soul, but
well, how many people really read others' eyes? or even pay attention
to!? &lt;strong&gt;Then, if you wear sunglass inside a Starbucks, that's like double
shields, isn't it? Bonus!&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Walked quite a bit after dinner along a, river? creek?, which led me
all the way to this fancy shopping mall called Kunming Square. I got
tired walking after a few stores, then just leaning aginst rail on the
2nd floor, and watching people for a while. To my disppointement,
girls in this city aren't really stylish, nor attractive &amp;mdash; they
do have a style, sort of Japanese, pretty cute, but they lack, the
move, which I can't describe what it is &amp;mdash; they wear a cute
clothes, but don't feel comfortable in it, just a feeling. You, on the
other hand, has a style, that is very, cool... well, everything about
you is cool anyway ~~&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Sitting in MUJI to take a breath, I started to look at people
wondering the store &amp;mdash; have you done that before? If not, I
strongly encourage you try it next time, just watch, watch them scan
shelves, as if deep in thoughts. What is it, I wonder!? I think
everyone, myself included, is just looking for something in the store
that is, affordable, catching the eyes (secondary, really), so s/he
is convincing him/her-self that "Yes we can buy this one, It's cute,
and reasonably priced.... " But honestly, I don't feel anything there
is reasonably priced, not even the Uniqlo across the isle! &amp;larr;
sadly, I can't even affort Uniqlo these days anymore.. but then, why
do people shop so to convince themselves in this way!? Just about 90%
of the stuff in the store I have no clue what they should be &amp;mdash; I
mean, I know what they do, but why are they priced as such? Style
itself doesn't justify, in most cases &amp;rarr; it justifies a shirt or a
dress, but it doesn't, simply doesn't, justify a dust pan, or a
storage box!! I'm sorry, I'm not getting it... but then, apparently
this is shopping all about &amp;mdash; we seldomly have a particularly
thing in mind to buy, we just wonder around, scan and scan and scan
(and I find processing that much information quite tiring actually!),
and trying to convine yourself "that one is not bad.. this one is
good", and so on. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So while sitting there and watching these, I wonder, the only reason
we do so, is to make yourself &lt;strong&gt;fit in, to be seen&lt;/strong&gt; as someone who
knows these stuff, whose life is filled w/, or associated w/, this
type of stuff. It isn't just a status symbol, but rather, is a
psychological treatment, to make ourselves believe, our lives are
somehow overlapping w/ the lives these stores are projecting. Watching
these people in the store actually reminds me a video clip I saw once,
that the first scene is a disco night club where all sort of people
were dancing to the loud music, body moves, heads shake, spirits high;
then, the 2nd scene, th exact same clip, but no music anymore, just
people &amp;mdash; they moved, then became, rather awkward, so stopped at
the end, dispersed.... Watching these people in Muji, or in Mall in
general, reminds me this scene &amp;mdash; they actually look quite,
strange, each w/ a sort of serious look on their faces, deep in
thoughts, appearing to be focused, but to me, deep inside, all I said
to myself was, "fxxxk it, this is fxxxking expansive, ridiculous, who
the hell buys this stuff, what a rip off...."&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Sigh, am I just an old fxxxk now? I start to lose interest and the fun
of window shopping, which I used to LOVE! Sad sad sad. But honestly,
try it yourself next time, stand outside yourself, or just watch other
people doing that, you will see what I mean &amp;mdash; so shopping, in
these fancy places, is just another mask we put on &amp;mdash; we try to
transform ourselves into this pretty setting, grabbing something sort
of expansive, but not quite killing ourselves, and that, feels good ~~&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You know what is real life, and when you see all the girls in the
neighbourhood in the open, almost in herds!? That's when I walked into
this filthy, smelly, back alley open grocery market this evening, and
saw quite a few young women buying groceries &amp;mdash; they shouldn't be
doing this, really, by the look and by the dress &amp;mdash; they should
have been living a princess life, loved and treasured by someone, kept
away from these chores, shielded from the unsightful side of life. But
then, this is real, this is a cruel side of life... cruel. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Bumped into a small book store in the middle of this artificial
pedestrian biz district. I usually don't like such settings at
all. This one is, ok, because they sell some old books, which I found
interesting, and the best part of it is, there was nearly no people
there! and no sound, no music, just open windows, golden leaves
falling once a while caught by a gush of breeze, shelves of books, B&amp;amp;W
photos of authors &amp;amp; thinkers on the wall along the top of shelves,
whom I hardly know any except Bernard Russel, but I liked looking at
them &amp;mdash; well, it isn't that much different from many other
boutique bookstores I have been. But I liked this one, not because it
was cool or unique, just a feeling, a mood, perhaps, that I'm tired
now, I want to sit on that little stool, just sit there, half squat,
and breathe.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Can we be nice? Can we be nice to, strangers? Can we be nice
strangers?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Coming downstairs to grab a bottom water from a nearby convenient
store. There was a little girl w/ her mom, probably 8 years old,
walking in front of me, and she went out the build door first, then
held it open for two other girls behind them, then me. I thanks her
for being so kind.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But, they walked behind me in the same direction to the store, and the
mom just wasn't happy at all, "Aren't u stupid!? Why did you do that!?
They got hands, too, you know!? Why did you do that!?.... " So it went
on and on and on... what's wrong w/ these people!? I couldn't take it
anymore. I turned around, thanks the girl again, and said to the mom
"She did a good thing, you know? You should give her a compliment." I
also wanted to refute her of her idea of "they also get hands" line

&lt;p&gt;I don't get it, really. I actually thought China has improved quite a
bit this time from what I witnessed. For one, cars are now forced to
yield to pedestrians! That is really nice! But then, once a while, I
can still feel the strange look when I'm being nice to a stranger, or
myself being a nice stranger. Why? If the girl is to grow up under her
mom's ideas, well well, I'm pretty sure she won't be a nice person as
she is right now, and, I would even speculate that her mom, by her
comments on this event, isn't nice at all, and is not deserved to
receive a kind gesture either... well, this is a bit too harsh. Let me
take this back. I disagree her comments on her daughter's kind
gesture, that's all.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Went to a mall today. Oh My God, do u know how big it is!? It's
enormous!! I guess it's like 10 football fields combined, isles and
isles of stuff, a lot of stuff, and a lot of the same stuff... it's
just massive, and super tiring! People literally ride bikes in it, or
on the segway! Walking from end to end is like 2 miles long at least,
and each floor has like 16 of them!! Then there are 5 floors, nearly
all filled!! Oh mine, I have never seen such scale before, simply mind
boggling! Searched for the canvas bags I want, but didn't find any,
too bad. It's not in fashion, I suppose. Got a old looking oil paper
umbrella that I have always dreamed about!!! Awesome!! Though it has
some drawings on it (two styles, one w/ a dragon and a phoenix, one w/
a white crane), it's ok. I joked the one dragon-phoenix one is either
for a king or a 太监, and the crane, though means long life, makes me
feel like a wish to die, haha. So I got a dragon-phoenix one. Now,
let's pray for some rain ~~&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Got super frustrated over work tonight. Shifting branches is creating
a nightmare, but that's technical and I can handle that. But what
pisses me off is that no one is giving me a straight answer &amp;mdash; I
emailed my opinion and raised concerns, and sometimes just a straight
yes/no question. Guess what!? They continued on what they were doing,
as if my concern had no effect, and for an email to question a merged
request "Did I miss some information on this?" I got is "we will
discuss". Fxxx that. I want a straight answer, not "we will discuss",
so I can have info to do my job properly. This is very screwy. I won't
bother till all shits hit the fans, and I'm back in the office again,
that I think I will have some serious, unpleasant conversation w/ some
folks regarding this project, and probably to ask them to remove me
from this project entirely &amp;larr; I'm getting really fed up now.&lt;/p&gt;</content><category term="thoughts"></category><category term="thoughts"></category></entry><entry><title>To Be Discovered</title><link href="https://fengxia41103.github.io/myblog/to%20be%20discovered.html" rel="alternate"></link><published>2019-12-19T10:54:00-05:00</published><updated>2019-12-19T10:54:00-05:00</updated><author><name>Feng Xia</name></author><id>tag:fengxia41103.github.io,2019-12-19:/myblog/to be discovered.html</id><summary type="html">&lt;figure class="col s12"&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Does everyone has talent? With popularity of the smart phone, all of
sudden, everyone is now a photographer, generating tons of photos, and
some of them are actually quite pleasing. Why do they post them in
wechat? To get attention? compliment? or, just that, they think they
have a &lt;em&gt;hidden&lt;/em&gt; talent, thus waiting to be discovered?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We have heard the cliche that 千里马常有，而伯乐不常有. Once upon a
time I was thinking the same thing of myself. But now, I wonder,
whether it's truly so? Thinking of you this morning, while reading the
blogs I wrote over this year. I wish I could share them w/ you
somehow, and wonder how you would feel reading them. But then, I had
to remind myself that girls are usually a lot more practical than guys
at the same moment, that the decisions they make are actually quite
advanced, just that guys didn't understand. If looking at them as a
bystander, I have to agree w/ the girls &amp;mdash; and also …&lt;/p&gt;</summary><content type="html">&lt;figure class="col s12"&gt;

guys in the same scene were usually so immature and clueless that it
is rather pathetic.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But, does it also apply to myself? Is it why I felt so stuck at the
emotion in those blogs, while the reality has been that I was just
clueless and immature, thus making it even more right for you to 断舍
离? (but honestly, I dislike this word at all! not only because it
hurt me, but that it felt rather bogus and like an execuse &amp;mdash; if
one were to 断，it doesn't mean s/he would have to leave离, or give
in. 断is not to continue on the same path as it were, but this person
could still be in your life). Anyway.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ran into a teeny tiny coffee shop yesterday. What an interesting
setup! It can seat, 3 ppl? Dim lights, not because they wanted the
mood, but the space is so small and caved in, that it simply has
little natural lights. The space was jammed w/ all kinds of
handwritten notes mixed w/ English, mostly about the business itself,
introduction of coffee beans, and a cool stereo setup that played some
rather &lt;em&gt;strange&lt;/em&gt; music after I asked them to play some music. The
music made the space a bit, time traveling, I would say. It was soo
dim that hardly any of my photos came out well. But it's ok. The owner
is a really cool guy &amp;mdash; just about everything he has, from a
handmade apron to his tiny water kettle, measure cups, brew gears,
grinders, some small arts here and there on his home made shelf and
walls, a stack of old books half the height of the only window in the
room, piles of beans in its linen bags on a pallet, two canvas bags on
top &amp;mdash; one has his diving gears, and another is a travel duffle
bag, a tennis bag, a guitar, and music and chocolate and coffee bean
smells in the air, and a woman who claimed herself to be his wife (but
she looks &lt;em&gt;unfamiliar&lt;/em&gt; with this setting, rather like a visitor, like
myself).... impressive. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This makes me wonder, whether the purpose of travel, or the fruit of
travel, is to discover these places, these people? But I don't
know. Rather, I would agree w/ 陈涤's comment, though it felt a bit
like a universal truth, that travel to a place is to reconcile
&amp;mdash; to reconcile w/ yourself, w/ this world, w/ this
life, w/ the person you love/hate, w/ the matter you
care/want-to-ignore, w/ your own past and your inevitable next
day. If you happen to be in a place like this coffee shop, maybe it is
fateful, also, that such things make you stay, to take a break, to
relax, to enjoy, and to discover beauty again.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I liked the coffee, not because it was charming, but it left a taste
lingering for a while &amp;mdash; it was bitter, but settling, makes me
think of you &amp;mdash; you may make me sad, but you make me, real.&lt;/p&gt;</content><category term="thoughts"></category><category term="love"></category></entry><entry><title>What is love</title><link href="https://fengxia41103.github.io/myblog/what%20is%20love.html" rel="alternate"></link><published>2019-12-18T20:21:00-05:00</published><updated>2019-12-18T20:21:00-05:00</updated><author><name>Feng Xia</name></author><id>tag:fengxia41103.github.io,2019-12-18:/myblog/what is love.html</id><summary type="html">&lt;figure class="col s12"&gt;

&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;What is it? I have written so much about this word, and have been
thinking so hard about what it is, but not until a few days ago, in
the evening, by the sunset, watching geese and ducks going home, w/ a
mountains far far away, no sound but the sound of ordinary country
life, when the old guy next door walking to his old lady, pulled out
his hand w/ some sunflower seeds, she reached out, w/ a big smile,
took them, and they stood side by side, just like, w/ all the wrinkles
testifying their identity and their tough life. Yet, they smiled, they
chatted, they were next to each other, in an arm's length, everyday,
every evening &amp;mdash; to them, this is not love, it's life itself
&amp;mdash; you don't label it w/ such exotic word, you simply live it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I asked the lady what she calls her Mr., "阿哥（gu er）", she smiled,
a bigger smile, on her face, when she was saying the words, 阿哥, so
sweet, so, sweet. "What …&lt;/p&gt;</summary><content type="html">&lt;figure class="col s12"&gt;

smiled again, a shy smile, at age 72, can't you be sweeter than,
this!? "He doesn't call me anything. He calls me by name... we call
each other by names", so she said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But here he was, pulling out a small gift he probably just picked up
from somewhere, or just found from his pocket, he gives them to her,
as if it were a given, and that, is what love is &amp;mdash; it's plain,
warm, and touching.&lt;/p&gt;</content><category term="thoughts"></category><category term="love"></category></entry><entry><title>Musicians</title><link href="https://fengxia41103.github.io/myblog/musicians.html" rel="alternate"></link><published>2019-12-17T09:31:00-05:00</published><updated>2019-12-18T21:19:00-05:00</updated><author><name>Feng Xia</name></author><id>tag:fengxia41103.github.io,2019-12-17:/myblog/musicians.html</id><summary type="html">&lt;figure class="col s12"&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Never thought there are so many musicians in this tiny little
city. But honestly, the first couple tunes got me &amp;mdash; so genuine,
touching, original. I like music, but I don't think music means the
same to me as to this person &amp;mdash; the music came from his inside,
he felt it when he played, he was the music, and the music gave peace
to him.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Met your uncle again tonight. He is a really cool guy. I was very much
surprised that he gave his diary (this is my understanding) to this
young guy whom he was taking in as hist very first student. That's
quite, bold, I would say. I'm curious what he has written in it. But
on the other hand, he showed quite well himself in this move and in
the little poem he wrote &amp;mdash; I felt he is in some kind of mood,
don't know what it is, that he decided to take in a student, but also

don't know what it is, that he decided to take in a student, but also
felt a bit awkwardness, I guess, thus saying that hoping he would be
able to be a good teacher for three days &amp;mdash; is this because he is
not confident of himself, that he is subject to a change constantly?
or that he is always doing and saying such things in such occasion in
order to be a well rounded person? I don't know him enough to
tell. Nonetheless, it was nice to have a chat w/ him, a legend I only
learned from you, and while chatting, I constantly looked for a trace
to feel, &lt;em&gt;fearful&lt;/em&gt;, as you have told me once, that you feel afraid of
him sometimes. But I can't see much of it, maybe some, not much
&amp;mdash; he is ok, he has seen much things, done much things, I feel
maybe the age is catching up w/ him also, that he is not as confident
as he was before anymore, and he started to reflect him life, seeking
what is really important, what is just vain. This is just my guess,
but a feeling I had while looking at him &amp;mdash; unlike your grandpa,
whose eyes sparked w/ a youth, wit, and fearlessness, your uncle's had
something uncertain in it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Watching him playing guitar is quite nice. However, I can't help
wondering whether he is still feeling, happy, by playing. Is he? He
appeared to be high, to be happy, to be in the mood, but only in a few
moments I felt he was in it. In other times, I felt he was trying, but
the word &lt;em&gt;trying&lt;/em&gt; exactly made me wonder that deep inside, he is not
as happy and excited as he shows. I really don't know him much at all,
so this is just rootless speculation. Anyway, I find him a fine person
to be with, maybe having some habits and lingos picked up from his
life in Beijing, so to be viewed as a sign of coolness. Behind all
these, he is a thoughtful person, maybe even an angry person &amp;mdash; I
don't feel a mind of peace in his play, nor a sense of losing-yourself
in the moment, but an endeavor, an effort, and that, makes me feel a bit
sad about him, actually.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Mr. Zhuang, &lt;strong&gt;the musician&lt;/strong&gt;, on the other hand, is just incredibly,
musical &amp;mdash; his play is just, incredible! I can't say how it
touches it, but it will, trust me, it will. Like human sadness, a
genuine feeling is contiguous, is universal, and when you see it, you
feel it, like a dagger piercing your heart &amp;mdash; pain, sharp,
real. That's his music, that's his person, that's his songs &amp;mdash;
pain, sharp, real. I can imagine his limitation which probably
hindered his success. But like everyone else, the weakness is also his
strength &amp;mdash; exactly because such, personality/traits, that his
music has the power to get into you &amp;mdash; is it echoing the same
feelings inside me, that I'm relating myself to him, thus making his
music powerful? Likely, though I don't want to admit.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Had a &lt;em&gt;early morning&lt;/em&gt; chat w/ her after all the guests had left last
night. I almost had the moment to tell her why I'm here, but I held
back. I need a person to speak to, but telling her will inevitably
complicate things, maybe even shocking to her, I'm afraid. I only
planned a trip to be here, so that I could see a place you were at, a
little place you might be someday. Yet, fate, truly, fate, surprised
me to a million degrees this time. The moment I stepped into the
courtyard that night, I didn't even know who she is. But in the last
few days I met all the people you had mentioned to me before,
especially grandpa &amp;mdash; I never know, never expected I would ever
meet him in person (same is true to your uncle also), but what an
odds! Not only I saw him, but I sat next to him, listened to him, saw
the place/room you were probably putting up the 窗花 before, and
probably will soon for the new year, (and his photo, the moment he
showed me that, I felt I have seen it before, and I probably have,
can't recall it for sure, but you may have showed me this at some
point, oh mine mine mine, memory, memory, I felt I was losing my mind,
I didn't know what to think anymore) &amp;mdash; yes, I'm here, as close
to you as I never dreamed; yet, you are like a dream to me now, once
waking up, there is only a slim sense of memory, however sweet it was,
it's no where to be found anymore.....&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;汤 took some photos of me, and posted them. I don't know whether you
see them, whether you would resent me being here, or thinking that I
had planned all these just to jam myself again into your life. My
dear, please trust me, I didn't, I would never &amp;mdash; I came here,
because I wanted to send your Birthday bless from here, from a place
that meant something to you, that's all. I wanted to see this place,
wanted to be a place that one day, it will see your footsteps again,
that you might hear people talking there was a guy from America who
traveled far far away to find this place, and he was a nice person
&amp;mdash; I wished that you will raise your head from the wechat,
listened to the conversation, and wondered who this person might
be. That's all I wished for, though I got too much more this time, way
too much more.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But my dear, I am here, I was here, for, I miss you, so much.&lt;/p&gt;</content><category term="thoughts"></category><category term="thoughts"></category></entry><entry><title>Funeral</title><link href="https://fengxia41103.github.io/myblog/funeral.html" rel="alternate"></link><published>2019-12-13T12:26:00-05:00</published><updated>2019-12-13T12:26:00-05:00</updated><author><name>Feng Xia</name></author><id>tag:fengxia41103.github.io,2019-12-13:/myblog/funeral.html</id><summary type="html">&lt;figure class="col s12 center"&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Human emotion, are the same.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Regardless gender, race, poverty, wealth, where you are from, what you
have been, what you are, emotions, are the same &amp;mdash; when you are
happy, you laugh; when you are sad, you cry.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I can't help crying over this picture. Picked it up off the book shelf
in 楠院, out of nowhere, here it is, a picture I truely feel the
emotion, that when you loved ones are leaving, how can't you not
feeling sad!? how can't you not feeling loneliness!? how can't you,
not cry!?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I have always felt that there is something about human's sadness, that
it's such a powerful, contiguous feeling, that if you are truly a
person that has not yet died inside, you will feel it, you will, as if
the event is happening to yourself, that it is really not something
external, strange to you, but part of you, part of your life.&lt;/p&gt;

think it makes one person a true person &amp;mdash; only w/ the emotion,
however it is, it tells myself that, yes, I can still feel, I can
still love. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I can't be w/ you anymore. It's ok. Sitting in this court yard,
bathing in this winter warmth, I'm feeling the closest to you, to
where you have been, to where you might be, someday. Yet, I know I'm
leaving this place, and leaving all the good days behind. I don't know
I will ever step into this town, into this city, into this area. But
my dear, believe me, I left a lot here, left them in the air, in the
sun ray, in the echos of the geeses, in the profile of the mountains,
in the breeze that brushes over the leaves, in the pond w/ the little
fish, in the fire and smoke at night, in the pebbles I stepped on, in
the dust I cleaned and wishing, that someday, when you are here, they
might tell you, that one day, there was a person, who travelled far
far far away to here, cleaned up this place as if he were expecting a
guest.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yes, it was me, and I did all these, because, I so wished, you would

&lt;p&gt;What an interesting trip so far! The host wants to take me to the old
town, which I initially thought would be a rather boring trip since I
don't really have much interest in the tourist stuff this time. Yet,
guess whom we ran into!?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Your uncle. What an odds!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;She is a famous person, apparently, in this little town, that just
about everywhere we went, there was someone who was nodding to her,
coming to her to chat, and smiled at her. And she had to stop often to
catch up w/ her &lt;em&gt;old&lt;/em&gt; friends and so on. Yet, completly unexpected, we
ran into him by the foot of the old city gate. Now watching the tiny
entrance to this new what I would call a private club, I suddenly
realized who he is, because the name of it rings a bell &amp;mdash; I
think you mentioned to me before.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Yes, so here he is, sitting across to me, quite an interesting, and
different person, than I pictured &amp;mdash; he is very, real. I don't
think he is intimidating at all. Maybe he is. Maybe it's just because
we had such a short overlap, that all the politeness was enough to get
by for such a short time, and by touring us the little space he is
making, there was also enough topics to talk about, and enough
opportunity to make it pleasant.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The space is quite, nice, small, cozy, full of, his thoughts. I like
it. Not because it is quite an exquisite place, but that he appears to
be a very thoughtful person. Unlike the &lt;em&gt;successful&lt;/em&gt; ego-centric
people I have come to know and disgusted in China, he is quite, real
&amp;mdash; he is full of his own thoughts, and I have to say I agree w/
most of them, not because they are in sync with mine, but that I
respect the process behind getting these thoughts &amp;mdash; unlike a
superficial millionaire, his mind is actively seeking to think over
these thoughts, to come to a term w/ himself. So it doesn't really
matter what it is, as long as it is original, genuine, and sincere,
which I think his words, are.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I tried hard to find a trace on his face of arrogance, of superiority,
some, not much. Then, his look reminds me very much of, you &amp;mdash;
maybe it is the family look you have inherited, the good looking
profile, and sharpness behind bright eyes, the eloquence of expression
which only comes from the self, not another common cliche copied from
pop talks and books. Yes, that is also, you. You may not yet think
this way, but I bet you will, someday, maybe sitting here in this same
court yard, sipping coffee (I think you will take coffee over tea
&amp;larr; my prediction ~~), bathing the sun, reflecting the days you
have had.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Maybe then, you may recall a person, who has passed your life. Will
you then feel that I have been here? I have also taken the coffee, had
the chat, the wall, the tiles, the white washed rooms, the large
windows inviting abundant sunshine into the room, the one lonely soul
who has come all these way to breathe this air, to see this town (but
honestly, never expected I would meet any of the people I have met so
far), just to be close, to you.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I don't know you ever will. Maybe it's better that way. Just like a
passing star, I ran across the sky, not to disturb or bother, but only
to leave a trace in the sky, in life, far far far away, don't know
ever it will pass again, don't know ever you have ever caught the
light, don't know ever you will ever know I have been here... &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But yes, my dearest sunshine, I came, I'm here, I want to see you,
even only there is a wall brick you have touched, I put my hands on
it, I tell myself, here, there is you, as beautiful as a creator can
ever make, as wonderful as a being can ever become, as delicate as the
三角梅 that was growing there, as real, as close, as warm.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I tried million times, to move on, to forget, to let go. The evening
breeze, the village noise in the background, the faint smell of smoke
and food, the mountains w/ its gray outlines in the distance, the
black tiles and white walls that looks both serene and old, none of
these, makes it easier &amp;mdash; I dreamed you sitting on the small
stool next to me, listenning to my tune, or reading this one day, if
only.... I'll leave this fate now. I tried, I did.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Happy birthday again. Be happy, sweet dreams.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;By pure odds, I stepped into this tea alley &amp;mdash; just the kind I
was hoping to do in Chengdu. Yet, sitting there among all the old men
who were playing Mahjiong or pokers, I felt, old, felt, irrelevant,
felt, sad. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I wanted to write something, I did, but the words didn't carry how I
felt. I smiled, chatted w/ the old woman who was attending the tables,
had a good time listening to her life and her stories, and yet, I
felt, void, inside. Was it because of the shade that there was no sun
but only a clear day? was it because the lights were getting dim
towards the end of day when I sat down? was it because I waited too
long for my noodle to come, thus getting frustrated? or, was it
because, this is a city of you, and yet, I couldn't imagine how it
would ever be like sitting here, w/ you aside?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Will you like this setting? this type of life? Will you join me, if I
get this …&lt;/p&gt;</summary><content type="html">&lt;figure class="col s12"&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Will you like this setting? this type of life? Will you join me, if I
get this old and do what these people do? or, will you just let me sit
here, alone, as I was doing then? Will you feel anything if I told you
I'm here, just to be close to you? I don't know where this place, I
liked it, liked the wall arts (which is quite amazing!), like the
people who spent their entire day strolling up and down the street, or
just sitting here sipping their tea and watching a game others play
&amp;mdash; I don't know what they get out of it by watching, but they
enjoy, they don't even mind standing there for a long time, just
standing there, watching, how interesting! Will you like this? I think
you will, when you are tired of walking, of pursuing the things that
are vain and empty, of running your brain 24 hours a day on some
difficult problems, of being stressed by ignorant or arrogant people
and their illogical decision, of being anyone but yourself, as if you
are drifting, alone, among thousands of other fall leaves, falling,
and beautiful.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Maybe. Maybe, one day, you will be sitting here, in this alley, at
this table, on this chair. Maybe, you will be chatting w/ this woman
who is still here, and she mentions years back there was a guy from
Beijing, sitting here, chatting w/ her, saying goodbye when he left,
wishing to see her again, and, that would put a smile on her face
&amp;mdash; though, she doesn't know, I was there, only to feel, this
city, this life, this place, that in my imagination, is what you used
to be &amp;mdash; hearing kids shouting and laughing behind the their
campus walls just by the alley, mixed w/ a few bare light bulbs on
each table for the light, so, it is night, so, I am here, in this mega
city, in this corner of the city, in this grayness of a winter
evening, missing you.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Tomorrow, I'll be on the road again, a long long bus ride which is
almost the same length from the States to China. I don't know how well
I will fare. But no matter. This is a place I want to see, a place I
want to be, on this day, no matter how far it is, how hard the trip
will be, I'll be there. It's funny that twice in my life I made a trip
to this part of the country &amp;mdash; unexpected, fateful. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So it is. &lt;/p&gt;</content><category term="thoughts"></category><category term="love"></category></entry><entry><title>Revisit</title><link href="https://fengxia41103.github.io/myblog/revisit.html" rel="alternate"></link><published>2019-12-06T18:37:00-05:00</published><updated>2019-12-06T18:37:00-05:00</updated><author><name>Feng Xia</name></author><id>tag:fengxia41103.github.io,2019-12-06:/myblog/revisit.html</id><summary type="html">&lt;figure class="col s12"&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For the first time in this trip that I can feel the time is finally,
all mine, that I can now plan for things I wanted to do, and see
people I wanted to see. Revisiting seems to be the theme of this trip
&amp;mdash; seeing old friends whom I haven't talked to face to face for
years, some I have been thinking to say something to but don't know
when or ever. Finally, I saw them all, talked to them all, visited
places I always felt I should in case I'm gone the next day. Less
regrets, more peace of mind, like paying back a debt, though the debt
is only on one's emotion, nonetheless it is there, often emerges into
my mind, calling me to settle it, someday, and that someday has
finally, realized.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The feeling after seeing all of them is rather, mixed. To some I can
feel the closeness, that our paths though have come apart, our minds
are still close; to some I feel the distance &amp;mdash; our lives have
all moved …&lt;/p&gt;</summary><content type="html">&lt;figure class="col s12"&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The feeling after seeing all of them is rather, mixed. To some I can
feel the closeness, that our paths though have come apart, our minds
are still close; to some I feel the distance &amp;mdash; our lives have
all moved on, and the context we are living in are so different now
that there is hardly anything to talk except relating the good old
days, but not much we can all see laying ahead of us. It will only be
fewer and fewer overlaps from now on, sad, isn't it?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Walking in the hotel room at Wanda suddenly reminds me the times Noah
was w/ me. I don't even remember now how many days we stayed here, nor
he went downstairs to the swimming pool or not. Just the settings in
the room is identical as what I remembered, making even think that
this is the same room number we had. How old was he? 3? 4? He was
little! I watched kids on the street who are about that age, how cute
are they! and how small are they!! I can't recall such conclusion when
he was that old, I'm sure he could only have been more cute, more
adorable than all the ones I saw, and yet, I only recall how stressful
the days were &amp;mdash; I don't know whether I'm still depressed, maybe,
I'm pessimistic these days for sure, not because I'm angry at my own
life, but that I'm  too annoyed by the BS floating around, the lies,
the say-one-thing-but-do-another people. Too many of them, too many.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Taiyuan is indeed a homey city. It looks pretty bad, but it feels full
of ordinary people, ordinary life. Walking by a small street grocery
market last night, really sad looking stalls and materials. Yet,
customers don't seem to mind, they bargain, they purchase, they sell,
they live their lives. You know, one thing I start to find different
in this trip is that I become understanding of many things in China
which I used to view as annoyance &amp;mdash; not only I see, but I feel,
that lives here are quite different, that people live differently, and
many live, poorly, but they don't have a choice, they have to get by
24 hours a day just like me, so &lt;strong&gt;when I see them on the street, by such
small market, I used to see disgust, poverty, misery, now I see
courage, bravery, spirit&lt;/strong&gt;! &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Life is hard. The one who can still hold his head high deserves
respect, don't you think?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Flying out today to Chengdu, the city that will get me closer to, your
home town. Like a petty thief who walks on a street w/ a stolen
treasure in his pocket, I'm moving closer and closer to the place you
lived once with growing anxiety and excitement. I don't know where you
are about anymore, nor knowing whether you are even willing to be
bothered by all these writings. I don't dare now to reach for a word
or a sound from you, and I don't wish to let you see me again since
I'm becoming old and ugly. But my dear, I can't yet cut the link in my
heart, so I have to find another way to make the tie, w/ you, if not a
future, then the past, a past I will go as far as I could, to find
you.&lt;/p&gt;</content><category term="thoughts"></category><category term="love"></category></entry><entry><title>Indirection</title><link href="https://fengxia41103.github.io/myblog/indirection.html" rel="alternate"></link><published>2019-12-01T12:25:00-05:00</published><updated>2019-12-01T12:25:00-05:00</updated><author><name>Feng Xia</name></author><id>tag:fengxia41103.github.io,2019-12-01:/myblog/indirection.html</id><summary type="html">&lt;figure class="col l6 m6 s12"&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I wonder whether the Chinese people have been used to reading,
indirectly &amp;mdash; so I was sitting on a cab going to the train
station this morning, and the driver had a music playing w/ a title
"30% of love and 70% of lie" (what a title, btw!) It's rather
unexpected and I asked him to play the song for me, nothing special,
just another those pop song that drivers and ppl who do labor works
like to hear, but the title caught my interest. So for a long time
since last time I took a picture of it and posted in my wechat, w/
some comments of love that whatever you do or think about love, just
don't lie, really, love is such a pure and beautiful thing, is such a
rare occasion in life, to put a lie into it is just, wrong.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But guess what!? Overwhelmingly the responses I received is all about
that inquiry whether I'm now back in China &amp;mdash; at the beginning I
felt rather annoyed by these, that it wasn't …&lt;/p&gt;</summary><content type="html">&lt;figure class="col l6 m6 s12"&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But guess what!? Overwhelmingly the responses I received is all about
that inquiry whether I'm now back in China &amp;mdash; at the beginning I
felt rather annoyed by these, that it wasn't my intention to use such
a way to announce my arrival/departure (as a matter of fact, I have
been in Shanghai w/ mom for over 10 days now, caught a terrible cold
and cough all these time, finally feeling better, thus having such a
thought when seeing the song title), and we are about to leave
Shanghai for Beijing as her annual migration route (and to think of
this, this is rather, reversed, don't u think &amp;mdash; that birds
migrate from cold areas to somewhere warm, and hers is the other way
around, well, so her!), so this so called a moment is certainly not an
arrival for me.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But then, it got me thinking &amp;mdash; why? why so? why do they all
catch the meaning as if I'm using this picture and comment to make
such an impression that I'm subtly telling everybody that here I am,
I'm back again!? I think they are just so used to &lt;strong&gt;interpret&lt;/strong&gt; a
meaning out of anything, as if every word heard carries a hidden
message, and they do and say and act in the same fashion also &amp;mdash;
words don't carry a face value, and they bury their true intention
deep hoping that they will be discovered/understood!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But why!? Isn't this the root cause of misunderstanding? When I was
writing it I had no intention of any sort of what they thought it was,
and yet, the response was uniform. So even for someone like me who
doesn't share their train of thought, their logic or reasoning,
inevitably, they could only react using the way they know &amp;larr; isn't
this because the society they live in is full of such things!?  I have
discussed this much in &lt;a href="https://fengxia41103.github.io/myblog/euphemism.html"&gt;euphemism&lt;/a&gt;, but my conclusion is the same
after two years, that such communication pattern is not only
pointless, but is outwright harmful &amp;mdash; we are already having too
much trouble making oneself understood, understanding others, being
able to reach an agreement w/ both parties knowing exactly what the
deal is, and here, everyone, out of their life habit, is only able to
read a line and respond by finding the &lt;strong&gt;indirect meaning&lt;/strong&gt; of a line
&amp;larr; I do give them credit by associating this w/ me being now in
China and giving me a warm greeting.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But honestly, my dear friends, that is not my point. I'm nobody,
unimportant, needing no attention, but wanting to share something I
found funny, some thoughts that gave me an urge to write, and that's
all it is &amp;mdash; life is hard, don't make it more complex than it
needs to be. Let's all try to be frank, straightforward, simple,
direct, speaking things you truly feel, preaching things you truly
believe, giving things you truly wish to, and appreciating things you
truly love.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yes, love, the one thing that is full of lies in life, can at least be
kept in purity in our mind, in our heart. No matter how messy the life
has made mine or yours, try, not to lie. Shall we?&lt;/p&gt;</content><category term="thoughts"></category><category term="thoughts"></category></entry><entry><title>Square dance</title><link href="https://fengxia41103.github.io/myblog/square%20dance.html" rel="alternate"></link><published>2019-11-28T20:37:00-05:00</published><updated>2019-11-28T20:37:00-05:00</updated><author><name>Feng Xia</name></author><id>tag:fengxia41103.github.io,2019-11-28:/myblog/square dance.html</id><summary type="html">&lt;figure class="col s12"&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You wouldn't believe where I am writing this right now! I'm sitting at
this square by the subway station on my way back to my place after yet
another full day visiting my Dad and another relative, and here are
like hundreds of people square dancing, with the loud, rythmatic music
and cold air, and subway train running by the high rise bridge with
its own sound, fascinating experience!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I used to look down on these square dancers, thinking that they are
pretty loser by being entertained by such poor taste in public
space. However, I was having a different feeling this time. As a
matter of fact, I'm having a different feeling about a lot of things
this time in Shanghai &amp;mdash; at the beginning I contributed it to the
terrible cold I caught which made me really dizzy together w/ jet
lag. But I think there is another reason &amp;mdash; not that I'm getting
older, but that after watching my Dad and others slipping into the
valley of their life, I start to accept uncertainty …&lt;/p&gt;</summary><content type="html">&lt;figure class="col s12"&gt;

terrible cold I caught which made me really dizzy together w/ jet
lag. But I think there is another reason &amp;mdash; not that I'm getting
older, but that after watching my Dad and others slipping into the
valley of their life, I start to accept uncertainty of life, the poor
reward it gives you, and respect whoever could still hold his/her head
high after a touch life, like these square dancers who are enjoying
themselves without much bothered by bystanders and their opinions
&amp;mdash; they just turn on the loud speakers, inventing a step that
matches the music, twist the body, arms, legs, jumping up and down,
sometimes lost a beat or two, but nonetheless, they are quite, happy.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Also, I think there is another thing about them which just occurred to
me &amp;mdash; why this activity makes them, happy?  I wonder whether
Chinese, of these groups of Chinese, only feel safe when they find
themselves belong to a group? Like a herd of lamb, they have to have a
social role that is part of a group so that they feel, even though
they may not admit, settled. I wonder that. I don't know, but that's a
strong feeling when watching these people over there. Does this
explain why there are such a strong tendency for Chinese people to be
fooled in a mass scale, by politicians, by lairs, or by
technologists who sell their pills dressed in buzz words? I feel
so. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But then, human are social animals. I'm probably an odd ball in term
that I do play well w/ social norms, when I choose so, just that I'm
always feeling like an outsiders peeking into a glass tank of
reptiles.... you know, this is really weird, that an airplane just
passed above, but its engine sound is almost drowned by the loud
speakers nearby, so that, what used to be annoyance for any American
residents whose house is below the air trail, has no effect here
whatsoever, because you simply can't hear! &amp;rarr; isn't this a
positive side effect or what!... here comes another airplane, again,
I'm watching the green lights approaching, actually not slowly, but
rather quickly, and yet, you can barely notices its existence because
you can't hear it. Fascinating, isn't it!?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Visited 大妈妈 this afternoon. Haven't seen her for, 10 years!?... has
been a long long time. She is 97, and what a woman! She is still young
at heart &amp;mdash; she was making jokes, smiling, and even made a face
to the camera! She is just, funny! I can't help wondering how she was
like when she was young &amp;mdash; was she pretty? was she cute? No doubt
she must be really smart and sharp. What a lively and funny girl she
must have been! Can't imagine it has been 24 years since my college,
and I still remember sitting at her table having meal together, and
she was then, as she is now, an old, tiny lady who was always smiling
and talking this and that.. Yet, she hasn't changed a bit, though she
has lost as much as everyone else over these years, and I only over
heard from 大姐姐 that her life has been a rough one &amp;mdash; but she
was smiling, smiling, making fun w/ you, making fun w/ life, what a
spirit! What a human being! I admire that, cause I won't ever be as
strong as she is; I doubt many can be.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Finally after these many days I started to feel my brain again &amp;larr;
the past few days have been a real daydream for me that I was walking,
talking, doing things, but my brain was just, dead &amp;mdash; I was so
tired, tired from travel, from jet lag, from the cold and
coughs... though the cough is still here, but has been much better
today, and for the first time since landing in Shanghai, I start to
feel that my brain is working, so that I'm now writing this, because
thoughts start to flow again, and my heart starts to feel things
again, something happy, something sad, someone forgotten, someone
recalled, someone I wish I could see again, someone I wish I could
love again, someone I could forever, be aside...

&lt;p&gt;He was neither a messiah nor a prophet, and he did not act as a
  medium between God and Man. His ideas were arrived at through
  reasoning not divine revelation, and it is this that marks Buddhism
  out as a philosophy as much as a religion. His quest was
  philosophical &amp;mdash; to discover truths &amp;mdash; and he maintained
  that these truths are available to all of us through the power of

fascinating. Starting w/ simple reading of different thinkers, I'm
hoping I will be able to develop a connection between popular
propaganda to its philosophical origin &amp;larr; not that these
propaganda were rooted in philosophy, but they have been dressing
themselves up to sound &lt;em&gt;philosophical&lt;/em&gt; by echoing thinkers' thoughts,
thus making people &lt;em&gt;believe&lt;/em&gt; they are deep &amp;mdash; the propaganda is
still BS, the thinker's thoughts are indeed, deep. So it is an act of
camouflage.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;Siddhartha Gautama (Buddha)&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;He was neither a messiah nor a prophet, and he did not act as a
  medium between God and Man. His ideas were arrived at through
  reasoning not divine revelation, and it is this that marks Buddhism
  out as a philosophy as much as a religion. His quest was
  philosophical &amp;mdash; to discover truths &amp;mdash; and he maintained
  that these truths are available to all of us through the power of
  reason.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The four noble truths&lt;sup id="fnref:5"&gt;&lt;a class="footnote-ref" href="#fn:5"&gt;5&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Suffering is an &lt;strong&gt;inherent part of existence&lt;/strong&gt; from birth,
   through sickness and old age, to death &amp;rarr; the truth of
   suffering (Dukkha).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The cause of suffering is &lt;strong&gt;desire&lt;/strong&gt;: craving for sensual
   pleasures and attachment to worldly possessions and
   power &amp;rarr; the truth of the origin of suffering (Samudaya).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Suffering an be ended by &lt;strong&gt;detaching oneself&lt;/strong&gt; from craving and
   attachment &amp;rarr; the truth of the ending of suffering
   (Nirodha).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Eightfold Path (right action right intention, right
   livelihood, right effort, right concentration, right speech,
   right understanding, and right mindfullness) is the means to
   eliminate desire and overcome the ego &amp;rarr; the truth of the
   path to the ending of suffering (Magga).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Sensual pleasures and luxury we indulge in to relieve suffering is
  rarely satisfying, and that when it is, the effects are
  transitory... the experience of extreme asceticism (austerity and
  abstinence) equally dissatisfying &amp;rarr; there must be a &lt;strong&gt;middle
  way&lt;/strong&gt; between self-indulgence and self-mortification.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Nothing in the universe is self-caused, for everything is the result
  of some previous action, and each of us is only a transitory part of
  this eternal process &amp;mdash; ultimately impermanent and without
  substance. So in reality, there is no "self" that is not part of the
  greater whole &amp;mdash; or the "not-self" &amp;mdash; and suffering
  results from our failure to recognize this. This does not mean that
  we should deny our existence or personal identity, rather that we
  should understand them for what they are &amp;mdash; transient and
  insubstantial. Grasping the concept of being a constituent part of
  an eternal "not-self", rather than clinging to the notion of being a
  unique "self", is the key to losing that attachments, and finding a
  release from suffering.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Nirvana, the ultimate goal of life on Earth is to be the ending of
  the cycle of suffering (birth, death, and rebirth) into which we are
  born.&lt;sup id="fnref:6"&gt;&lt;a class="footnote-ref" href="#fn:6"&gt;6&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;Confucius&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The superior man does what is proper to the station in which he is;
he does not desire to go beyond this.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;He seeks constants in a world of changing, and for his this meant as
  search for moral values that could enable rulers to govern
  justly.&lt;sup id="fnref:3"&gt;&lt;a class="footnote-ref" href="#fn:3"&gt;3&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Faithfulness and &lt;/strong&gt;sincerity&lt;strong&gt; are shown in traditional &lt;/strong&gt;rituals
  and ceremonies &amp;rarr; these qualities in these settings allow
  &lt;strong&gt;virtue&lt;/strong&gt; to become &lt;strong&gt;visible&lt;/strong&gt; &amp;rarr; virtue is then made
  &lt;strong&gt;manifest&lt;/strong&gt; in the world &amp;rarr; virtue can then &lt;strong&gt;be seen&lt;/strong&gt; by
  others &amp;rarr; others are &lt;strong&gt;transformed&lt;/strong&gt; by virtue &amp;rarr;
  faithfulness and sincerity hold the power of &lt;strong&gt;transformation&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Before him, the world had been explained by mythology and religion,
  and power and moral authority were generally accepted to be
  god-given. According to &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Analects"&gt;Analects&lt;/a&gt;, we humans are the agents
  that Heaven has chosen to embody its will and to unite the world w/
  moral order &amp;larr; this part is the same as traditional view.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;However, 德(virtue) is not something Heaven-sent for the ruling
classes, but something that can be cultivated &amp;mdash; and
cultivated by anyone. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To reconcile the fact that society is a rigid class system w/ this
  德 that all men can receive, he argues that virtuous man is not
  simply one who stands at the top of the social hierarchy, but one
  who understands his place within that hierarchy and embraces it to
  the full.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;How to act virtuously: 忠孝礼术 &amp;larr; who sincerely observes
these values are 君子. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;忠 (faithfulness) is the guiding principle, 5 relationships, in order:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;sovereign &amp;mdash; subject: rulers should be benevolent, and subjects
   loyal.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;father &amp;mdash; son: parent is to be loving, and a child
   obedient.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;husband &amp;mdash; wife: husbands are to be good and fair, and
   wives understanding.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;elder brother &amp;mdash; younger brother: an elder sibling is to be
   gentle, and younger siblings respectful.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;friend &amp;mdash; friend: older friends are to be considerate, and
   younger friends reverential.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Such hierarchy reflects is significant because it reflects the
fact that each person should know his station in society as a
whole, as well his place in the family and the clan.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;How to manifest that one knows his place in society? &amp;rarr; 孝
(filial piety) &amp;rarr; it's more than just respect one's parents or
elders. It reinforces the relationship of inferior to superior,
which was the central to his thinking.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;礼 (ritual propriety) is the outward signs of an inner 德,
  eg. ceremonies of marriage, funerals, and sacrifices to the
  etiquette of receiving guests. **It is only a sign of 德 when
  performed with sincerity. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Sincerity becomes apparent. From being apparent, it becomes
manifest. From being manifest, it becomes brilliant. Brilliant, it
affects others. Affecting others, they are changed by it. Changed by
it, they are transformed. Only he who is possessed of the most
complete sincerity that can exist under Heaven, can transform.&lt;sup id="fnref:4"&gt;&lt;a class="footnote-ref" href="#fn:4"&gt;4&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One can learn to become a superior man by first recognizing what one
  does not know (echoing Socrates that his wisdom la in accepting that
  he knew nothing!), and then by watching other people &amp;larr; if they
  show virtue, try to become their equal; if they are inferior, be
  their guide.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Golden Rule of "do as you would be done by" appears as a
  negative in Confucius &amp;mdash; "what you do not desire for yourself,
  do not do to others" &amp;mdash; &lt;strong&gt;Confucius does not prescribe what to
  do, only what not to do&lt;/strong&gt;, emphasizing restraints rather than
  action.  This implies modesty and humility &amp;mdash; values
  traditionally held in high regard in Chinese society. Fostering
  these values is a form of loyalty ot oneself and another kind of
  sincerity.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;Heraclitus&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You can never step into the same river twice&lt;sup id="fnref:2"&gt;&lt;a class="footnote-ref" href="#fn:2"&gt;2&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The road up and the road down are the one and the same.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Everything is flux.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It is the balance of opposites, such as day and night and hot and
  cold that leads to the unity of the universe, or the idea everything
  is part of a single fundamental process or substance &amp;mdash; the
  central tenet of &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Monism"&gt;monism&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Tension is generated between these pairs of opposites &amp;rarr;
  everything must be in a permanent state of flux, or change &amp;mdash;
  day changes into night, which in turn changes back again to day.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;Parmenides&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;All is one.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;He employs &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Deductive_reasoning"&gt;deductive reasoning&lt;/a&gt; in an attempt to uncover the
  true physical nature of the world.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;From the premise that something exists ("It is"), Parmenides deduces
  that it cannot also not exist ("It is not"), as this would involve a
  logical contradiction &amp;rarr; a state of nothing existing is
  impossible &amp;mdash; there can be no void.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Everything that is real must be eternal and unchanging, and must
  have an indivisible unity &amp;mdash; "all is one".&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;He shows by his process reasoning that our perception of the world
  if faulty and full of contradictions &amp;rarr; we can never rely on the
  experience that is delivered to us by our senses.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;Protagoras (a Sophist &lt;sup id="fnref:1"&gt;&lt;a class="footnote-ref" href="#fn:1"&gt;1&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;)&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Many things prevent knowledge, including the obscurity of the
subject and the brevity of human life.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Man is the measure of all things.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It is spring day in Athens &amp;rarr; A visitor from Sweden says &lt;strong&gt;the
  weather is warm&lt;/strong&gt;; a visitor from Egypt says &lt;strong&gt;the weather is cold&lt;/strong&gt;
  &amp;rarr; Both people are speaking the &lt;strong&gt;truth&lt;/strong&gt;. &amp;rarr; The truth
  depends on &lt;strong&gt;prospective&lt;/strong&gt; and is therefore relative. &amp;rarr; Man is
  the measure of all things.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Belief is subjective, and it is the man holding the view or opinion
  that is the measure of its worth... This relativism also applies to
  moral values, such as what is right and what is wrong. To
  Protagoras, nothing is inherently good in itself. Something is
  ethical, or right, only because a person or society judges it to be
  so.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Also, it shifted focus of philosophy away from an understanding of
  the nature of the universe to an examination of human behavior.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;div class="footnote"&gt;
&lt;hr&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li id="fn:1"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Greek &lt;em&gt;sophia&lt;/em&gt;: widsom&amp;#160;&lt;a class="footnote-backref" href="#fnref:1" title="Jump back to footnote 1 in the text"&gt;&amp;#8617;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="fn:2"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;However, the river itself is always described as one fixed and
  unchanging thing.&amp;#160;&lt;a class="footnote-backref" href="#fnref:2" title="Jump back to footnote 2 in the text"&gt;&amp;#8617;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="fn:3"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Confucius's teachings make a lot of sense when viewed in its
  historical background that it was the period of the Warring
  States &amp;mdash; thus how to rule properly and how to bring peace
  back to life is an urge issue to solve.&amp;#160;&lt;a class="footnote-backref" href="#fnref:3" title="Jump back to footnote 3 in the text"&gt;&amp;#8617;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="fn:4"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;However, I think this reasoning is inherently flawed. By stating
"the most", it implies that there could only be &lt;strong&gt;one man&lt;/strong&gt; fits
such role, thus automatically ruling out all could become 君子.
Only one.&amp;#160;&lt;a class="footnote-backref" href="#fnref:4" title="Jump back to footnote 4 in the text"&gt;&amp;#8617;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="fn:5"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I like this, a clean layout of reasoning &amp;mdash; definition of
problem (suffering), analysis (cause of suffering), solution (how
to end suffering), roadmap of execution of solution (eightfold
path). Brilliant!&amp;#160;&lt;a class="footnote-backref" href="#fnref:5" title="Jump back to footnote 5 in the text"&gt;&amp;#8617;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="fn:6"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Wow, so the idea of rebirth is actually a sign that you are
going to suffer, again! How this is the opposite of popular beliefs!&amp;#160;&lt;a class="footnote-backref" href="#fnref:6" title="Jump back to footnote 6 in the text"&gt;&amp;#8617;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I start to like coming to this YMCA lobby for work in the
afternoon. Coming here a bit earlier than Noah's pickup time, and I
can sit here just breathe the atmosphere, watching people coming in
and out in their gym clothes, listenning to a light music in the
background, tempted by the White Oak coffee right across to my table,
putting feet up on the bench, with a high ceiling of, I don't know, 20
fee or more, and knowing that at any minute I can go to see Noah, or
the kids will just come out to get their snacks here w/ their
counselor... all these thoughts, make me, happy, relaxed happy.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It was cloudy in the morning. But the temperature has been rising over
the day, and now there is sun, though it's getting close to be a
sunset now, so the Sun feels rather, relaxed also, that it beams its
heat here and there, but also dancing w/ this music, here and there,
no agenda, no purpose. Then, I thought of …&lt;/p&gt;</summary><content type="html">&lt;figure class="col l8 m8 s12"&gt;

heat here and there, but also dancing w/ this music, here and there,
no agenda, no purpose. Then, I thought of you.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You know, you have always been giving me this feeling that you should
have a life just this &amp;mdash; happy, warm, relaxed, surrounded by
things and people you love/care, just wondering here and there, no
agenda. I think you will like this place. I can almost hear what you
will say if you were here. Well, maybe not. I used to knowing you so
well that I could tell what you would say. But not anymore. I don't
know what you would say, but still, I think you will like it &amp;mdash;
the high ceiling, the concrete floor, the coffee shop w/ no customer,
the people walking by, the kids in the lobby, xmas decorations, wood
frames that brings warmth, the bench I'm sitting on, and the life,
filled w/ holiday airs, maybe the music could be better, like playing
the list I have collected over the years since you introduced me this
app since we first met, but still, it's nice, and I wish you were
here, to experience all these.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I don't know. Will there be a day that someday, you will be sitting
here, and thinking of me, thinking what I would have said or written?
You probably never would, nor guess that I have written all these to
you. It's ok. Everytime I went to the Reader's Corner for books, I was
always wondering how the owner of those books would feel that now they
are lying in this shop, picked up by strangers like me &amp;mdash; so many
books had handwritings on the front page saying "Dear who and who, I
hope you will like this book... Love, who and who". Will the giver be
disappointed if s/he knew that the person this book was given to has
not dumped it to a second hand book shop for almost nothing (and too
often I heard "I'm moving" "I'm cleaning the closet")? But when it was
still a gift, maybe even in a wrap, it carried so much thoughts, so
much expectations, so much, likes, loves... it's sad to think this
way, isn't it?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But still, I'm writing down these because they came to me, the moment
I was closing the car door, feeling the sun's warmth on the head, you,
came to my mind &amp;mdash; always, always, when there is a breeze, when
there is a blue sky, when there is clouds floating like a group of
cottons, when there is a tune, when there is clinkings of cups and
utensils from a coffee shop... always, always, always, I wish all
these that make me happy, belong to you.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I miss you very much.&lt;/p&gt;</content><category term="thoughts"></category><category term="love"></category></entry><entry><title>Is it fate?</title><link href="https://fengxia41103.github.io/myblog/is%20it%20fate.html" rel="alternate"></link><published>2019-11-16T08:25:00-05:00</published><updated>2019-11-16T08:25:00-05:00</updated><author><name>Feng Xia</name></author><id>tag:fengxia41103.github.io,2019-11-16:/myblog/is it fate.html</id><summary type="html">&lt;figure class="col l8 m8 s12"&gt;

&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Upcoming trip in six days now. For some reason I'm feeling anxious of
this trip since a few weeks ago &amp;mdash; a feeling of both excitement
and worry. Unlike the 2016 trip to 深圳, before which I had a
feeling before the trip that "something is going to happen", and I
meant something that is &lt;em&gt;big&lt;/em&gt;, and it did, I met her. This time the
feeling is more of an uncertainty because I don't know what is going
to happen, not much of self-confidence that "yes I will be ok", but
that if something happens, I don't know how I will come through, maybe
good, maybe bad.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Had a talk w/ Li Jian over Friday's lunch, about fate. Of course we
were just joking about whether there is such that we meant to see each
other at lunch time to have lunch, then I joked that I must not the
one in his pre-life to put a cover over his body when he was lying on

were just joking about whether there is such that we meant to see each
other at lunch time to have lunch, then I joked that I must not the
one in his pre-life to put a cover over his body when he was lying on
a beach &amp;mdash; a derivative of the 鸡汤 story that a girl was found
on the beach, naked, the first man walked by and didn't do anything,
the second man did something, don't remember what it is now, then came
along the third guy who went over and put his coat over her body
&amp;mdash; then after cycles of rebirth, the girl became the third guy's
wife in this life, to repay his kindness on the beach.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Familiar story line. Always this gets to the moral of the story that
it is fate/destiny for the two people to be together in marriage
&amp;mdash; inevitable, meant to be, w/ a noble reason behind it, always.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But then, it just occurred to me, this logic plays in this direction,
but what about the &lt;strong&gt;other point of view&lt;/strong&gt; &amp;mdash; the guy in this
case, is he ready to receive such arrangement!? We all know too well
that in love there isn't a promise that if I love you, you will
definitely love me back. Well well, then in this cycle of repayment of
love/kindness/whatever, who says the guy is ready, or even happy, to
receive the girl's give-back!? Nobody! &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As a matter of fact, I can even argue that the not-to-receive is more
likely to occur than the expected fateful arrangement. Think about
it. If the guy is such a kind person, he must have done quite a few
good deeds in that life cycle, which then means that all of them will
seek a route to repay his kindness, do they spread out in such a way
so that only one occurs in his life cycles afterwards? but even so,
what if he continues to be a good person so to generate more good
deeds? This certainly will become a compound math, which after a few
cycles/generations, will become a quite large number!!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So when the girl shows up in his life, ready to be his wife, there is
likely a queue lining up w/ similar cases, thus she has to wait for
her turn, which God knows how long the queue is, what if her life runs
out before her turn is up? does she lose her spot in the line if she
dies and tries again in the next life cycle? That sounds pretty,
depressing. Let's assume that she saves her spot, there still isn't
any guarantee that the guy will &lt;em&gt;love&lt;/em&gt; her, or even &lt;em&gt;like&lt;/em&gt; her, well,
of course we can argue that this entire process is all about her
paying the deeds, not him giving her anything, thus it doesn't matter
how bumpy the road of her giving-back is, actually, the bumpier, the
better because, like the trip to the West, all challenges turn into
proof of her determination, thus a hallmark of the &lt;strong&gt;fateful&lt;/strong&gt;!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Fascinating, isn't it!? But now I can see a flaw in all these, and
feminist will love what I discovered &amp;mdash; the fateful story was
created to beautify love, making it a quite touching story because the
relationship you two forms extends way beyond this life. However, by
having the woman lying on the beach, it has put woman in the passive
position for the rest of her rebirth cycles &amp;rarr; she has to wait in
the guy's pay-me-back queue, take chance of him favouring her so to
give her a change, and jump through hoops and hurdles in between to
demonstrate her will and purity of intention &amp;mdash; all these, are
&lt;strong&gt;unfairly&lt;/strong&gt; put upon the woman, because she received an act of
kindness!! &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Further, the moral of such story implies that life becomes an
accounting book of good deeds and bad deeds, that you will have to
settle/balance somehow, in some generation, sooner or later. In the
western world, you settle w/ God at your death, say, donate all your
properties to church so to be saved (book is reset to 0). Here in this
oriental version, you setting w/ that &lt;em&gt;kind&lt;/em&gt; person by becoming his
wife or something, but this is shakier than setting w/ God because, in
theory, there is only one God, so the identity is clear, and logic
behind this God is quite clear, too, like written in a book which
people &lt;em&gt;study&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;teach&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;learn&lt;/em&gt;, but settling w/ some guy/girl
which you have no memory whatsoever, only a fuzzy feeling that maybe
you know him/her!? Man, that doesn't sound a sure thing at all!!! But,
&lt;strong&gt;isn't fate supposed to be, well, sure!?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So by making up a story like such to describe the effect of fate, it
completely miss the point by making the effect rather uncertain, thus
defeating its own preach. Maybe I'm overthinking again, but this
mental exercise is quite, amusing. I wonder whether many other so
called legends should be scrutinized in such a way as well, just to
see whether it has an inconsistent logic that breaks itself. That will
be fun actually.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Anyway. So much for the fate. At least, I think you shouldn't use that
lying-on-beach story anymore, because it is quite wrong. But me
meeting her back then, yes, it is fateful, because I can't ever
forget, however many lives I will be through, live, and die.&lt;/p&gt;</content><category term="thoughts"></category><category term="thoughts"></category></entry><entry><title>Misconception</title><link href="https://fengxia41103.github.io/myblog/misconception.html" rel="alternate"></link><published>2019-11-07T08:11:00-05:00</published><updated>2019-11-07T08:11:00-05:00</updated><author><name>Feng Xia</name></author><id>tag:fengxia41103.github.io,2019-11-07:/myblog/misconception.html</id><summary type="html">&lt;figure class="col l6 m6 s12"&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I'm in a constant amazement how misconcepted this world is, by me, and
by many many others. Not only of this world as it is now, but the so
called history, things that have happened, have passed, should have
been written in stone, crystal clear, no ambiguity. Yet, when reading
a book like &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/America_and_Americans"&gt;this one&lt;/a&gt;, it's truly an eye opener that what I
thought I have known, what everybody thinks they have known, were not
so, were, perhaps, forgotten, or, were not understood in the first
place.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Sometimes I feel the history is playing a funny game, that by a common
sense, the longer you wait, usually the more faded the memory becomes,
thus the more likely what was remember became less and less &lt;em&gt;accurate&lt;/em&gt;
or &lt;em&gt;reliable&lt;/em&gt;, like what I have argued against in &lt;a href="https://fengxia41103.github.io/myblog/china nationalism.html"&gt;this article&lt;/a&gt;
that many of the Chinese elites are propogating the &lt;em&gt;main stream&lt;/em&gt; idea
of China's history with much distortion, which are obviously
&lt;strong&gt;illogical&lt;/strong&gt; because they failed in cross checks. But they were
&lt;em&gt;invented&lt;/em&gt; anyway so to fit for the needs …&lt;/p&gt;</summary><content type="html">&lt;figure class="col l6 m6 s12"&gt;

&lt;strong&gt;illogical&lt;/strong&gt; because they failed in cross checks. But they were
&lt;em&gt;invented&lt;/em&gt; anyway so to fit for the needs of the uprising nationalism
sentiment and of course, the needs of the ruling authority at all
levels, whatever the level may be, and whatever the ruler's taste and
preference may be. As the proverb says, 上有所好, there must then be
providers to satisfy it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But on the other hand, there is another &lt;em&gt;convention&lt;/em&gt; that the longer
you wait before looking back, the clearer you will start to see what
was truly the case, because the effect of the even had been known, had
played out, and it's much easier (in theory) to formulate a causal
argument which is both convincing and closer to the truth, even though
I also constantly have the doubt that causal relationship is but
another human invention to assist our perception, and there are, have
been, and always will be, many many casual relationships that can be
formed out of any two events, historical events in particular, because
they can not be tested again, thus are nothing but interpretations,
your words against mine, that kind of deal. Nonetheless, the more
stepped back you are from the event, the more likely you are less
partial about one way or the other, thus giving you a better chance to
be neutral and objective, cool-headed, to cut through the mess and see
the core. But doing so also requires not only knowledge and judgement,
but practice, then, how would one gain practice without first making a
lot of such mistakes? This ask itself is illogical, isn't it? What a
catch 22!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I never read the &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Grapes_of_Wrath"&gt;The Grapes of Wrath&lt;/a&gt;, and didn't know &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Steinbeck"&gt;John
Steinbeck&lt;/a&gt;. But this &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/America_and_Americans"&gt;book&lt;/a&gt; is fascinating. I wish I could type
it down because there are so many points I couldn't agree more. More
importantly, the process that America has emerged, how people have
treated &lt;em&gt;newcomers&lt;/em&gt;, are the exact same pattern being played out in
China, in a new community, in a team in a company, over and over and
over, thus making me to believe that this pattern is not only common,
but is speaking loud how human groups behave, predictably,
unchanged. Actually everytime I came across a book like this, I can't
help having an urge to go back to school and take on social studies
&amp;mdash; though I am disgusted by human's behavior I witness everyday,
especially during the morning rush hours on the road, I think social
study as a way to research and observe human and human group, is the
much harder task to undertake than an engineering challenge &amp;larr; I
can learn many many of the hard science and math, but I can't get even
a slim grip on human's emotion, desire, reaction, thinking. It's
either that I'm just bad at it, or, they are just too damn hard!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Anyway. Let me type down the first misconception of America, that
people have come to this land to form a paradise on earth with
everybody being a sisterhood or brotherhood, such a friendly place,
friendly people, wonder idea &amp;mdash; wrong, wrong, wrong. And I'm
hoping that by reading this, you will start to question everything you
think you have come to see and hear, and wonder, whether they have
become a misconception:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It is customary (indeed, at high-school graduation it is a
requirement) for speakers to refer to America as a "precious
inheritance" &amp;mdash; our heritage, a gift proffered like a sandwich
wrapped in plastic on a plastic try. Our ancestors, so it is implied,
gatherd to the invitation of a golden land and accepted the sacrament
of milk and honey. This is not so.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the beginning, we crept, scuttled, escaped, were driven out of the
safe and settled corners of the earth to the fringes of a strange and
hostile wilderness, a nameless and hostile continent. Some rulers
granted large sections of unmapped territory, in places they did not
own or even know, as cheap gifts to favorites or to potential enemies
for the purpose of getting rid of them. Many others were sent here as
a punishment for penal offenses. Far from welcoming us, this continent
resisted us. The Indigenes fought to the best of their ability to hold
on to a land they thought was theirs. The rocky soils fought back, and
the bewildering forests, and the deserts. Diseases, unknown and
therefore incurable, decimated the early comers, and in their energy
of restlessness they fought one another. This land was no gift. The
firstlings worked for it, fought for it, and died for it. They stole
and cheated and double-crossed for it, and when they had taken a
little piece, they way a fierce-hearted man ropes a wild mustang, they
had then to gentle it and smooth it and make it habitable at all. Once
they had a foothold, they had to defend their holdings against new
waves of the restless and ferocious and hungry.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;America did not exist. Four centuries of word, of bloodshed, of
loneliness and fear created this land. We built America and the
process made us Americans &amp;mdash; a new breed, rooted in all races,
stained and tinted with all colors, a semming ethnic anarchy. Then in
a little, little time, we became more alike than we were different
&amp;mdash; a new society; not great, but fitted by our very faults for
greatness, &lt;em&gt;E Pluribus Unum&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The whole thing is crazy. Every single man in our emerging country was
out for himself against all others &amp;mdash; for his safety, his profit,
his future. He had little care for the land; he ripped it, raped it,
and in some cases destroyed it. He cut and burned the forests, fired
and plowed the plains, dredged the beautiful rivers for gold, leaving
a pebbled devastation. When his family grew up about him he set it
against all other families. When communities arose, each one defended
itself against other communities. The provinces which became states
were each one a suspicious unit, with jealously held borders and
duties, tolls, and penalities against strangers. The surges of the new
restless, needy, and strong &amp;mdash; grudgingly brouhg in for purposes
of hard labor and cheap wages &amp;mdash; were resisted, resented, and
accepted only when a new and different wave came in. Consider how the
Germans clotted for self-defense until the Irish took the resented
place; how the Irish became "Americans" against the Poles, the Slavs
against the Italians. On the West Coast the Chinese ceased to be
enemies only when the Japanese arrived, and they in the face of the
invasions of Hindus, Filipinos, and Mexicans. Nor were the dislikes
saved exclusively for foreigners. When dust and economics rooted up
the poor dirt farmers of Oklahoma and pushed them westward, they were
met with perhaps even more suspicion and resentment than the other waves.

&lt;p&gt;8:30 pm. Out of nowhere, after his Mom left for gym, he said to me,
   "爸，我决定了，等你有了517, 我和你住" "Why?" "Because I think it
   will be difficult living with her." "Why?" "So she bought snack
   without looking at the label, and it turned out to be wasabi
   flavored, and I was the first one eating it, and I didn't have
   water then..."  hahaha!! Poor little guy!! But I asked him whether
   he has other reasons for this decision, and he said, "第二， she
   gets up late, so there is increasing chance I'll be late for
   schoolbus."  "Anything else?" "Yes. I'm actually feeling scared by
   myself at home, though everytime I said I will be ok." "You mean
   when she goes to gym and leaves you at home?" "Yes" "Then tell her
   so next time." "ok" "I leave you for gym when you come with me in
   the office also." "But that's daytime."..... "Of course. You can
   come live with me anytime. I'll get you a key... wait, I'll
   introduce you to the concierge, so she will know you, and you can
   just come whenever you want."&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;10:00 pm. Math, struggling w/ the concept of "20% off", which he
   subtracted &lt;code&gt;$0.2&lt;/code&gt;. Why so? "So how much is 20%?" "It's 20 over 100"
   "So how much will that be?" "0.2, 20 cents". Speechless, isn't it!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"Noah, remember to think before you ask." Pretty common
   conversation between. I don't recall what the topic
   was. Anyway. Listen to this. "爸， 我在新加坡的时候就有think." Very
   firm tone. "Really!? How?" "你记得吗？那个时候我想要touch一个bird
   poop" "我不记得了...然后呢？" "然后你说了No" "Yeah, that sounds
   right!" "但是那个时候我就有think" "How!?" this is interesting "真的
   真的！那个时候我就在think, 那个bird poop看起来是dry, 所以我就很想要
   touch它"...... speechless, isn't it!? What an example he gave to
   testify that he actually, thinks ~~&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Noah figured out how to put his math answer back into the equation
   to verify, "哇塞，我做的这么对！！" He was genuinely surprised by
   himself, haha, what a fun to watch him grow in moment like this.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A beautiful early summer evening. After a long stressful day
   evacuating the contractor and his tools, having a barbecue w/ Noah
   outside the kitchen. He was talking w/ his mom about virus
   vs. bacteria. Mom was asking about "do you know which virus, and
   the only virus, cured by human so far?" (it was Hypatitis-C). Noah
   studied his science vigilantly in the week and the topic was about
   virus &amp;amp; bacteria, so he was confident in the discussion. However,
   he didn't have this piece. So instead he realized his gap, and said
   "Do you know what I cured?... Dad's loneliness." &amp;larr; because in
   that afternoon, he was my companion to 517 to clean up the mess
   left by the contractor, and on the way home I said thank you to him
   for being my companion. How funny!!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On our way home from 517, I was commenting on Noah's hair and asked
   him "what is his secret". Guess what he said? He was very serious
   and also in a good mood, responded that "I will give you one
   advice, is to use woman product." "Why woman product?" "因为她们总
   是想要look good, so you must use woman product" "所以你用她们的
   product, 你也会look good" "是啊，and I use 妈的shampoo" "是吧， 但
   是那都得等很久，像什么15分钟，我没那个耐心，那你怎么办的？" "I will
   meditate" "meditate?" "yeah" "what if it's still too long?" "那我就
   put on more shampoo"... hahahaha.... this is the very first time
   Noah seriously gives me his advice, and you can tell he is really
   believing in his own discovery in this one!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This one heard from his mom. She caught him taking a loooooong time
   in shower, and asked him what's taking him so long. "你的shower 有
   很多头发堵了，我在给你de堵".... what a, Chinglish?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On our way back from 517. There was a shower in some areas ahead
    of us. So by the time we were on the road, it was wet. All of
    sudden, Noah said "yi2" "what" "彩色，虹", you know, in a mumbling
    kinda of way, that he heard the word spoken by us, but doesn't
    really know how to say it properly. Very cute!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At dinner table, Noah started a thread, "爸，你知道，葡萄美酒夜光
    杯，是啥么？“”知道啊，这个叫唐诗。你咋知道的？“ So it turned out
    he saw it on mom's phone the other night, and he thought it's
    extremely funny, because, "美酒，no wine!" he claimed, and started
    laughing hard, by himself.... errr....pretty speechless ~~&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Had a wechat call w/ 陈思，I figure it would be good to connect
    him with some social friends at his age, and help him to establish
    some confidence. After an hour of talk, I asked "so 陈思家有只兔子
    是吧？”“对，她家有只兔子，还有很多鱼，她还有很多鸟....她还养了个姐
    ".. hahaha... well, so I was overhearing their conversation, that
    the girl introduced her older sister, and Noah brought up the&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Telling Noah we will have 豆腐骨头西红柿汤. He suddenly raised his
    head, looked at with an expression of awe, "等一下，你是说，今天的
    豆腐有骨头?"..... hahaha ~~ The kid is always super &lt;strong&gt;precise&lt;/strong&gt;!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Was at dinner at his mom's place over 2020 xmas. He was having
    something in the breakfast, and his mom commented that this is
    something he has been longing to have, thus he is now 如原以偿. He
    immediately countered, "No! 我没有常想(这个东西）I didn't always
    think of it".. oh well, what can I say?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At lunch chatting w/ Noah about the small room I'm thinking to
    decorate. "我觉得那个屋子可以用来打游戏“，”I agree! 它又小，又黑，
    还有门".. huh!? hahaha, and he bursted into a laugh himself
    also. Both of us realized what he meant &amp;rarr; so he could shut
    himself inside and play as much as he wants. Hahahaha.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After dinner, showing Noah the old album I brought back from
    Suzhou. There was picture of Dad when he was probably late 20s,
    and he didn't recognize him. Then on the next page, another of
    his, probably early 40s, and Noah pointed it out, "这是也爷爷!"
    "Not bad. How do u know?" "Because 他在 sporting 他现在的
    look"... hahaha!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Saturday morning, asked Noah to help w/ breakfast &amp;mdash; cutting
    an apple, and a grapefruit. I guessed I said "orange" when I
    handed the grapefruit to him. So he &lt;strong&gt;peeled&lt;/strong&gt; it, the way he
    always wanted to do.. I held my tongue this time, "let him do
    this, and it should be fine".. then, I put some on his plates,
    knowing grapefruit isn't his thing. But, behold! He took a bite,
    and gave me a looking of eating a poison! "爸！！！你为什么说这是
    orange! 这是grapefruit!" "我说了！""你没有!!""咋了吧!?" I asked. "
    如果这是grapefruit, 我刚才cut的时侯会更严肃点!!""what do mean by严
    肃点!?"... so it turned out, by peeling his way, he left some
    those soft skins, which, according to him, is bitter, and his 更严
    肃点 is to remove more, if not all of, those skins... hahaha!! 更
    严肃点~~~&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Trying to solicit him taking interest in Chinese. So I let him
    watch the romance of the three kingdom by 横山光辉, w/ English
    subtitle. So it calls "字“ as &lt;em&gt;style name&lt;/em&gt;. So I was trying to
    teach him what a 字 means in a name, then, he pointed at the
    screen, "萌的!!!" (the sound), and it is showing 曹操， "style
    name: Mengde".... hahahaha!!! Noah noah noah, what am I gonna do
    w/ your Chinese!?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;11/15/2022 Sitting in Starbuck and he just finished his math
    homeworks. Asking him to throw away a leftover box to trash. Guess
    what!? He turned around w/ a stack of triangometry problem sheets
    in hand, and immediately he started working on it!? ... is this
    the same guy I know!? Unbelievable! and he looked quite happy
    working on the sheets. What a surprise! I asked him why, and he
    said he just wants to do more.. and 2nd trip to the same trash can
    he picked up yet another stack! hahaha... we joked about some kid
    throwing away his/her math homeworks that way so to avoid working
    on it and had a good laugh out of this. Wonderful time!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;2/23/2023 On our way to his swimming. "Did you eat something?"
    "yeah I had salmon" "哦， 是吧，家里有salmon啊!!" "现在没了"
    ... hahaha... such an American way of understanding Chinese. No
    Chinese native would have interpreted the line on such a face
    value, but he did.. it was just halirious! I think this will be a
    great item for some foreigner's TOEFL test someday.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;5/29/2024 Sitting at a high table McDonald's after his swim
    training at night. I said, "I'm thinking to get a 大house, you
    know, with a big yard...你觉得这主意怎么样?" He shook his head. "

&lt;p&gt;Sad, this is really sad, that I find no time to write down my thoughts
these days. When I had them, usually on the way to work, or was busy
cooking, I thought I would have them down a moment later. But when I
get to the office, immediately I got sidetracked into audition of
Jira, emails, meetings, meetings, meeting of meetings... this pattern
is just becoming too much a bore to my taste. I wonder how those great
author had been able to write what they wrote, while they themselves
must have had all the ordinary worries of life, good days, bad days, a
moment of light, and a long period of darkness? how did they do that?
Is overcoming these nuances the true struggle to deliver those master
pieces? Did these nuances actually make the author, I mean, in the way
that it hardens his/her will, sharpens his/her observation and

that it hardens his/her will, sharpens his/her observation and
feeling, lets him to see through the superficial window dressing of
life, of the matter he was writing about, and forces him to experience
the things that hurts so badly, thus touching not only himself, but
his reader? &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I think so. The real tough thing of living is the life itself, and the
fact that when hardship hits, it doesn't guarantee to end your life,
but only guarantees to makes you unhappy. And while breathing, you
have to sustain and survive the unhappiness, trying to get up again in
the morning, doing whatever the job and the family is calling for,
feeding yourself 3 times a day, dealing w/ water bills, leaking
toilet, miss charged back account, broken down car, traffic, sitting
through meetings which you have little to say but was dragged in as a
head count and &lt;em&gt;relevant&lt;/em&gt; person (how ridiculous!), kids suspended by
school or the YMCA because he "laid his hand on another kid" even
though, according to his own account, he was fed up by a kid bullying
another kid, thus &lt;strong&gt;punched&lt;/strong&gt; the bullying one in the stomach &amp;larr;
and I gave him credit for doing so, because for the first time in our
relationship I start to see a silhouette of what he will be, and I
like him to be that way &amp;mdash; being a person who doesn't fear to
step forward for things he deems wrong (excellent job Noah!)... and if
you have lived through all these, are in the midst of all these, and
still have a mind and a thought watching out for the world around you
&amp;mdash; the autumn leaves turning color, the breeze w/ a slight
drizzle, the mellow sound of guitar when the air is moist, the night I
was thinking of you, wishing to speak to you of these things, of the
mind when I still have it, of your days, your dream, your wish, your
happiness and sadness, then you should write, write them down, write
them out, write them as they come, as they go, as they hide from you,
appears on one day, disappears on another, but still lingering around
&amp;mdash; yes, write them down, write them down. They are memories, they
are more than memories, they are the only material that makes you a
worth living life, not because you have achieved much, but because you
have endured much, but has not yet given it up, not yet lost the spark
you were born with, and still have a sense of, feeling, of love, of
tenderness, of agitation and anger, of a lot of sighs, and of some
smiles in between, of even laughs &amp;mdash; all these, like marks man
etches on a rock wall or a wood stick to track time, are the tracks
of, you.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So, I'll write, more, if I can, whenever I was thinking of you,
whenever I take a deep of breath of a fresh air, whenever I take
another picture I think it's nice, whenever I have something I want to
show you, to talk to you... whenever, I still know, you are there.&lt;/p&gt;</content><category term="thoughts"></category><category term="love"></category></entry><entry><title>Where</title><link href="https://fengxia41103.github.io/myblog/where.html" rel="alternate"></link><published>2019-10-30T08:24:00-04:00</published><updated>2019-10-30T08:24:00-04:00</updated><author><name>Feng Xia</name></author><id>tag:fengxia41103.github.io,2019-10-30:/myblog/where.html</id><summary type="html">&lt;figure class="col s12"&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I had a dream, so real, that I had you in my arms, and I buried my
head in your hair, kissed it, smelled it... oh how much I love you, my
dear, how much I miss you. You didn't say a word, but you smiled, so
beautiful, so real.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For the first time in my life, I hated to wake up, not just resent,
but hate. For the first time in my life, I couldn't tell what was real
and what is a dream. For quite  a moment I was sitting there on the
couch, not knowing what to believe, not knowing how to feel, because
it was so real, but it was only a dream.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Where are you? Are you safe? Are you having a good time? ... if only I
could know where you are now, and how you are doing. You know, I
looked up your &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Huili_County"&gt;hometown&lt;/a&gt; yesterday. It looks like a cute place,

not many people (400,000 by the wikipedia), far far away, to the south
near 云南, sounds exotic... and the most important thing is, it was,
you.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Isn't this fate, that I keep running into girls coming from that area,
who always left a mark on me, from the first one I met, to you? I
don't know. Maybe there is fate. I didn't believe it; I'm not sure
I'll believe it now. But yes, there is, and for us, I wish I could
have changed it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A rainy Wednesday, not cold at all, actually rather warm, reminding me
the weather of 昆明, maybe it's also like this in your hometown. I'm
planning to visit it this time. I don't know what I expect to
see. Just walking down the streets, or sitting in shops, dreaming that
you may have been here also, would have been good enough for me. For
how much I yearn to make another link w/ you, w/ your life. If fate is
like two threads, I wish ours will interwind again, tie a knot, and
never open. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So for the wish of this year, I wish, I could see your place, find
your footsteps, hear the sound you have heard, breathe the air you
have breathed, live the city you have lived, taking pictures as I go,
not for memory's sake, but to show you, someday, some way, or to show
God when I see him, that, I miss you very much, I love you so dearly
that I keep dreaming, a life, that you and I are nearby.&lt;/p&gt;</content><category term="thoughts"></category><category term="love"></category></entry><entry><title>Unpeaceful mind</title><link href="https://fengxia41103.github.io/myblog/unpeaceful%20mind.html" rel="alternate"></link><published>2019-10-25T10:02:00-04:00</published><updated>2019-10-25T10:02:00-04:00</updated><author><name>Feng Xia</name></author><id>tag:fengxia41103.github.io,2019-10-25:/myblog/unpeaceful mind.html</id><summary type="html">&lt;figure class="col l6 m6 s12"&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Though it is a Friday, actually just another Friday in life, in 2019,
weather is nice, went to the gym, didn't have much sleep last night
since Noah and I had a rough night, but my body felt fine, not
tired.. but for some strange reason, my mind, is very disturbed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I sense this strange timing this morning, that wherever I went, I ran
into some good looking girl or woman, and happened to be, that we will
across each other walking towards the same direction, but w/ them
always just a few steps behind me... to me, it is just a very strange
feeling that someone walk behind me like that, as if I were being
observed. I kept telling myself, don't be such a self-centered person,
who really cares about you anyway? Yet, it's just part of me since I
was little, that I constantly sense, or imagine, that their attention
was on me... well, what else to look at anyway, when there is just
someone walking in front of you, and not …&lt;/p&gt;</summary><content type="html">&lt;figure class="col l6 m6 s12"&gt;

was little, that I constantly sense, or imagine, that their attention
was on me... well, what else to look at anyway, when there is just
someone walking in front of you, and not like walking on the 5th
Avenue that you get a lot to check out. Here we are, walking towards
office from parking lot, or from bld 7 to bld 8 crossing the 奈何桥,
no one but the two of us... it was just, uneasy.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Very often, first thing in the morning, you will start to notice a
pattern for the day, keeps happening wherever you go, whatever you
do. On some days the pattern is good, so you would have a good day;
then on others, man, just embrace yourself, and survive.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Why so!? I'm not a fatalist at all. But why so, why this pattern, why
can I sense it while it seems that others simply don't notice them at
all? Are they really just a reflection of your mind on that day, that
when you were happy or in a good mood, the sky would be blue
regardless what the weather really was!? or, they are indeed external
to me, existing independently. Though my mood would influence my
perception of the blue sky, it can only tint it, not change it? or can
it change it altogether?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I don't know. But this morning I have this strange feeling that
something is off. Noah is really struggling w/ his homework &amp;mdash;
the kid spent 2 hours working on one single math problem out of a
lesson's practice, which has 7 problems on a double side A4! &amp;larr;
and he didn't even get that problem right! wt heck!.... then, he
didn't get to bed till 1 o'clock in the morning!!!!.... isn't this
crazy or what!... what's up w/ him? I tried all kinds of persuasion,
father-and-son chat, punishment, encouragement, even played checker
last night after dinner just to &lt;em&gt;relax the mood&lt;/em&gt; and give the kid a
break... none worked. Disappointing, indeed. I don't know what else I
could help this kid to understand that study is like his swim
training, is like the theme of the hare &amp;amp; tortoise story &amp;rarr;
perseverance. He might have been born w/ a brain of a hare. But his
race against his peers have just been another hare's race, also
&amp;mdash; he got distracted left and right, and he is not far behind all
the tortoises. I hate how Chinese parents use the analogy of a race to
describe how kids are competing each other even when they were first
born, so called 输在起跑线上, I thought that's completely BS, and I
had felt lucky for Noah that I could give him an environment in which
he would not be put in such a position to endure such nonsense. Oh
well, so I have failed miserably. Not only he didn't appreciate the
privilege, but he failed to take advantage of the head start, and
refuses to grow up. I can't say it is very disappointing, because I
have to remind myself that it is unfair to him to impose my
expectation upon him. But I have to say, he is letting me down, he is
letting himself down. I really don't care whether he wins the &lt;em&gt;race&lt;/em&gt;
at all, because I really don't care how all the other kids are doing
comparing to him. Yet, he is not doing well. Not at all. He is
becoming a worse person than before, and I don't know how to stop him
from becoming so.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Maybe the truth of my uneasy mind this morning, is that, I'm
disappointed of myself. Not only I have lost the battle of marriage,
of happiness, but now have lost the battle of parenthood, of making a
happy kid and a smart son. So that's what really is, a LOSER, written in
capital, indeed.&lt;/p&gt;</content><category term="thoughts"></category><category term="thoughts"></category></entry><entry><title>S.T.E.M</title><link href="https://fengxia41103.github.io/myblog/stem.html" rel="alternate"></link><published>2019-10-24T13:38:00-04:00</published><updated>2019-10-24T13:38:00-04:00</updated><author><name>Feng Xia</name></author><id>tag:fengxia41103.github.io,2019-10-24:/myblog/stem.html</id><summary type="html">&lt;figure class="col l6 m6 s12"&gt;

opinion on why we still need an English major.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I can't agree more.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I believe we are living in an era in which science, technology,
development, progress are being hailed as the new gospel. As if they
bring no burden but only solve the existing problem, we treat them as
a free lunch while each one of us are well versed that there is no
free lunch, of any kind, ever. Instead, they are wonderful but not
magical; they solve things while creating new issues &amp;mdash; it's the
natural course of progress, of course, but they shouldn't be set in an
altar. On the contrary, I think we need more debates on its
&lt;a href="https://fengxia41103.github.io/myblog/technology responsibility.html"&gt;responsibility&lt;/a&gt; and its role in the &lt;a href="https://fengxia41103.github.io/myblog/technology and society.html"&gt;society&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

regarding their children and their &lt;em&gt;awesome future&lt;/em&gt;, is becoming
another window dressing that can be used to promote and propogate
these trends (or, should I just call them, fads!?) so that they are
deemed holly, thus immune from attacks, criticism, or even doubt. But
if one takes one step back to look at what is occupying the mind of
the media, thus the crowds, one has to wonder that on the one hand why
the society is so diverse, thus becoming impossible to manage, and on
the other, so synchronized, that herd effect is seen everywhere, all
the time, in every country, some better, some worse, but just the
same. Why!?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When I first went to BU, the slogan of its "arts and science" seemed
rather strange to my ears &amp;mdash; grantedly I was all about STEM back
then, arts, huh, who needs arts? I was never able to understand much
of the arts, though honestly I tried. So to me back then the idea of
arts w/ science is like marrying arts up to a prince, or down marry of
a prince to Dianna, not from the same league, but w/ some love in the
scene, sure.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But more and more I start to appreciate the power, the beauty, the
necessity of arts. I forced myself to read Dr. Zhivago since I liked
that movie very much, just to have a starting point of reading
novel. I am still struggling w/ arts, though I have long been in love
with music, many kinds, really, almost like women &amp;mdash; there is
always someone you find appealing, interesting, tempting, even
beautiful, among any crowd &amp;mdash; so is music, on a given day, there
might be a tune on your mind, and can vibrate a chord in your heart,
and make you cry.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yes, we need arts, we need English major, we need writers, need poets,
need these people not only because their creation touches us, but they
often have such a deep perception of human, of the society, of the
era, that when captured in word, in painting, in movie, in tune,
becomes crystalized, preserved for ages, don't get old, don't become
obsolete, hardly even become irrelevant or weak, because it's the
human core they have penetrated, have the eyes and ears to see and
hear, have skill to describe, have the desire to share, have the
courage to face.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;STEM and English majors, are sense, and sensibility.&lt;/p&gt;</content><category term="thoughts"></category><category term="thoughts"></category></entry><entry><title>Smart phone</title><link href="https://fengxia41103.github.io/myblog/smart%20phone.html" rel="alternate"></link><published>2019-10-05T08:42:00-04:00</published><updated>2019-10-05T08:42:00-04:00</updated><author><name>Feng Xia</name></author><id>tag:fengxia41103.github.io,2019-10-05:/myblog/smart phone.html</id><summary type="html">&lt;figure class="col l8 m8 s12"&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I have long been wanting to discuss this topic &amp;mdash; smart
phone. This discussion/thought had started in 2014 when I was in 太原
and was chatting w/ 谢部 at a Starbucks downstairs near her
office. Out of my own experience w/ this type of devices &amp;mdash; a 红
米 given by my uncle, then later a new one I bought myself, w/o any
previous experience in the States before I went (I insisted using a
cheap flip phone back then), thus was forcing myself to use a smart
phone with nothing but practical purpose &amp;mdash; to communicate w/
family and colleague and customer, to navigate the places completely
strange to me, and so on &amp;rarr; thus, I consider this experience to be
quite fresh and genuine because it has no prefix, nor bias. Besides,
considering myself to be a tech person, I didn't expect there would
have been much a barrier to adopt the new trend, and enjoy it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But, my opinion was, and still is, that:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;It is not smart at all.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;As a matter of fact, the touch screen is quite annoying, and very
   un-user-friendly!&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;And it is a fad for the time being, but is not the future, because
   it has an assumption, which I believe is untrue.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;not smart&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It's called smart phone simply for marketing reason. In my eyes it is
nothing but a computer in disguise, even the first time I heard and
saw such thing. I don't understand why people are sooo hailing its
&lt;em&gt;invention&lt;/em&gt; as if this was a shocking discovery that no one but Jobs
had conceived and made it reality.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Quite to the contrary. Everything on this device has been invented,
implemented, marketed, and failed, on a personal laptop, before. I
recall back in probably 2000 or even earlier that Norman Lee was
saying he wanted to buy a $2000 laptop w/ touch screen because it
would help his Ph.D research presentation w/ colleagues. Myself had
also looked at a non-brand-name laptop before buying the Sony one
which offered touch screen &amp;mdash; which essentially is just a way to
tell the mouse where it should be instead of using a touchpad.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I was not aware of GPS inside a device. But it's not a far fetch to
think they must have existed in such small format in some portal
device already &amp;mdash; I bet REI must have carried such hiking gadget
if I had looked. Hell, I remember there were Casio watch boasting to
have compass built in! And for the communication modules &amp;mdash; wifi,
bluetooth, you name it, they have all been there as a card in desktop,
or a smaller card in laptop, or, in the smart phone's case, an even
smaller fashion. And there will always be SoC if one is willing to pay
the $$. So hardware wise, this is a commercial success instead of an
engineering achievement, in my view.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Once you realize this is a computer, well, then it is just as smart as
any software engineer can make it, no more, no less. As of today, all
the things a user does on this phone bears such a distinct mark of a
computer user &amp;mdash; click, tap, type in a command in some fancy
looking search box &amp;mdash; &lt;strong&gt;this is just as uninteresting as one can
be&lt;/strong&gt;! Not to mention how awkward software now has to adapt to an army
of different resolution, screen size, browser engine.... this is
ridiculous! Next time when you think it is smart, you should really
make it more accurate that this is a phone programmed by some poor
smart software engineer who had ironed out the quirks and put in a
gazzilions of &lt;code&gt;try.. except&lt;/code&gt; statements so that the code path your
usage will traverse is like a tiny proportion comparing to what s/he
has done, thus it appears to be super smart, super stable, super
thoughtful.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When people have been unwilling to adopt a laptop as an everyday toy,
they are eagerly embracing the same device only dressed in a different
costume. This, says a lot about human and human psyche.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;poor user interface&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I really don't like touch screen, at all.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The number one annoyance is that people seem not to realize in 99% of
the time, the one single control you want to click/tap is occupying
like 5% of the screen or less! &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;How many times you have tried to click on that &lt;code&gt;close&lt;/code&gt; window cross
   icon which is not nearly as large as your finger (yeah, finger tip,
   by its wording, can be just a tiny dot to the infinite smallness,
   isn't it! This is insane.) Then you have to take a deep breath,
   focus your mind momentarily, stead your hand, poke, and w/ a bit of
   luck, to get that icon.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;How many times you are on the phone, and it touches your cheek, and
   when you look down to either search for the keypad or mute button,
   man, it is a screen you don't expect! and you have to leave the
   phone off your ear &lt;strong&gt;so you can see&lt;/strong&gt;, and trying to fix it, while
   your mind is going into panic mode because now you might be missing
   whatever is on the phone the other end is saying! This is
   ridiculous to the Nth degree! And btw, holding a large square next
   to your ear looks really strange, especially on woman! I can't
   believe why women will tolerate such, and some even are proud of
   their devices. Honestly, this is the opposite of what I understand
   what a woman will like &amp;mdash; don't they like soft, airy, light
   things!? This device is nothing but the complete opposite of
   these. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;How many times half of your screen is taken by the keypad, so when
   you are typing a long message, especially in paragraph, it becomes
   very annoying if you want to look back what you just said. Even
   worse, the WeChat input box is, what, 2 lines of input space!? and
   people are still spending hours typing into that! This is just
   utterly disgusting! Really! Sometimes I think, maybe unfairly, but
   truthful to myself, that whoever designed such input style is
   just stupid, or is just giving all the users a GIANT MIDDLE
   FINGER. And for the users who still like it, man, they are just
   stupid. Period.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;More on typing. I just read a slashdot that &lt;a href="https://mobile.slashdot.org/story/19/10/03/221259/typing-speeds-on-mobiles-rival-keyboard-users-says-report"&gt;thumb typing is now
   achieving a good typing speed as if on a real keyboard&lt;/a&gt;. Yeah,
   you can call this a text book example of human adaption to
   environment. But in my mind, the speed isn't the issue; the error
   rate is. Just how many times you have been typing away when your
   mind is flowing, and you had to erase words, wrong letters, over
   and over again, because, well, that keypad is too small for your
   elegant finger(tip) that is &lt;strong&gt;fat and unprecise&lt;/strong&gt;! Typing on these
   phones always remind me that if I were so good at aiming at that
   little square which occupies like a tiny bit of the screen, I could
   have become a real pianist! This, again, is just, ridiculous!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;it will go away&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The smart phone won the battle against other &lt;em&gt;smart&lt;/em&gt; devices back in
2007 time frame not because it had superior technology &amp;larr; at the
time, two other competitors who also offered user network connections,
which is the foundation of everything we rave about a smart phone and
its apps, were GPS and regular wifi. GPS was very much applicable to
user who spends a lot of time in car; and regular wifi has been there
long before the smart phone, and places like MIT not only had an
incredible campus network, but students had hacked together the
concept of city wifi by volunteering their computers as router so to
connect from one hop to the next!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So, the only reason phone became the winner is that, people must have
a phone out of living necessity &amp;mdash; you have to have a phone to
call somebody to conduct business and life. That's all it is. If
internet calling could have been as cheap and quality as we have today
(it was limited both by the infrastructure bandwidth and compression
algorithm), regular laptop could have stood a real chance.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Anyway. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Then, there is an argument that even with the wearing smart devices,
it will still require a "brain" &amp;mdash; a command center that is to
coordinate them &amp;larr; however, to me this is just another sign of the
current thinking how computer and program work today. However, it is
more likely that individually these distributed computing unit,
borrowing the term &lt;strong&gt;service&lt;/strong&gt;, will expose a certain API that can be
utilized by whoever wants to use the service, and each handles its own
service within &amp;mdash; very much like the idea of central government
vs. decentralized governing, many of the things can be done by
decentralized fashion while there will be certain activities only
possible or cost-effective if centrally managed... as a matter of
fact, I believe the more computer evolves, the more its interaction
with each other will mirror the human society with its benefits and
challenges, and certainly the problems which the human society has yet
to find a solution. Like how society evolves also, it will naturally
start w/ a central command center (kings, lords, leaders), but will
inevitably driving towards a distributed governing model, then hit
some scenarios that can not be handled individually, thus inviting
swinging towards the opposite direction, and then back and forth with
endless debates, as what we see in politics, ideologies, today.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;conclusion&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There you have it. Smart phone is an interesting device. However, up
till today I have yet to find it essential, and far from being
impossible to live without. The strongest argument will be about
social media, but even on that I have stated a different opinion in
&lt;a href="https://fengxia41103.github.io/myblog/social media.html"&gt;this article&lt;/a&gt;. Therefore, I really consider myself to be an
opponent against all these &lt;em&gt;smart&lt;/em&gt; devices in general &amp;mdash; in the
same vein that I'm suspicious of the word "intelligent this or
that". There isn't anything magical about them; there are only hours
of frustration, abstract modeling, strong assumption of usage, more
test and code paths than any one user can possibly exceed, and
unbelievable peer pressure that when your friends are using this app,
that phone, you (think) you must have it, too.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Instead of viewing them as a technology achievement, it is more
interesting as a social experiment which reveals and manifest human's
inner desire, fear, anxiety, and like.&lt;/p&gt;</content><category term="thoughts"></category><category term="thoughts"></category></entry><entry><title>What we know is untrue</title><link href="https://fengxia41103.github.io/myblog/what%20we%20know%20is%20untrue.html" rel="alternate"></link><published>2019-09-28T11:25:00-04:00</published><updated>2019-09-28T11:25:00-04:00</updated><author><name>Feng Xia</name></author><id>tag:fengxia41103.github.io,2019-09-28:/myblog/what we know is untrue.html</id><summary type="html">&lt;figure class="col l8 m8 s12"&gt;

touched by a book because it spells so many points which I feel, I
think, and agree. This is a great book with great insights, and are
honest about the past and the present (as of 1966).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Indeed, so many things we have learned, thought to be the case, are
not so. America and Americans are full of paradox &amp;mdash; the early

&lt;p&gt;So here I'm going to document things of the untrue:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;woman lives longer than man, polygamy&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Women, by nature's choice, is to bear children, which put a tremendous
tax on her body. Also, rearing the young is not an easy task, which
women played a dominating role historically, which also didn't help to
stretch her life long. Thus, until recent medical advance, women have
had a shorter life span than men! Never thought of this.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Doesn't this also explain polygamy, that as a natural tendency of
balancing risk, just the same that the poorer a family is, the more
kids they have, because of a poor survival rate? Also, that can
explain why men was marrying women younger than he was &amp;mdash; again,
another measure against the commonality of her short life.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Well, I'm taking John's statement blindly. I'll be interested in
seeing some evidence/research on this topic whether this is
true. Nonetheless, this is quite an interesting possibility.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;how to raise a child&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I have been puzzled by the &lt;em&gt;unarguable recognition&lt;/em&gt; that we should
leave &lt;a href="https://fengxia41103.github.io/myblog/a better world.html"&gt;a better world&lt;/a&gt; for our children because they are born to
deserve it. I have even argued in &lt;a href="https://fengxia41103.github.io/myblog/sympathy.html"&gt;this article&lt;/a&gt; that this way of
putting children as the crown jewel of an adult's life and the
society's most important asset has created a strong incentive for the
mass shooters to choose school as his (well, so far I have only heard
men doing this) target so to maximize his damage. I know this is a
difficult challenge because, not only myself is a parent and I
have grown to accept this view, but the alternative will be natural
selection, in which case who can say me or Noah will be a survivor?
Then what?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;However, it's also a common knowledge that two generation ago,
children were born in batches, and they were viewed as, children
&amp;mdash; we recognize every pitfall his/her ignorance can cause, and
guard against them fiercely by parental punishment, peer pressure,
school discipline, social norm, and law. But now, they are revered as
semi-God, and they were given the task to realize our unfulfilled
dream as if they are magician &amp;larr; this is a great bet, indeed! We
cast a net broadly, and once a while we get a lucky hit, and it
doesn't have to be your kid. But we parents all bet, and hope for
being the power ball winner, because it does happen, all the time.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What do you call this, craziness? or, love? I never thought hope,
being also in Pandora's box, can actually just another evil, not a
savor God give to human out of sympathy of all others released from
that box.&lt;/p&gt;</content><category term="thoughts"></category><category term="thoughts"></category></entry><entry><title>Middleschool</title><link href="https://fengxia41103.github.io/myblog/middleschool.html" rel="alternate"></link><published>2019-09-26T09:47:00-04:00</published><updated>2019-09-26T09:47:00-04:00</updated><author><name>Feng Xia</name></author><id>tag:fengxia41103.github.io,2019-09-26:/myblog/middleschool.html</id><summary type="html">&lt;figure class="col l6 m6 s12"&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Watching Noah to do homework these days is like watching paint dry
&amp;mdash; a true challenge of patience, and the result is often very
disastrous. His mom decides to &lt;em&gt;work with him&lt;/em&gt;, but by my observation,
it's more or a less a shouting contest, and Noah showed a strong sign
of rebellion. It makes me both happy because I know he is going into
his teens and is on the track of his development, and mad because his
rebellious attitude, to his mom in particular, has been there since
young, and I worry whether he is also doing so at school, which then
will not abide well w/ others... and, is this why he is having
difficulty to make friends? I have been deliberately skipping to walk
him to bus last few days cause I wanted to give him his own room to
meet and chat w/ his bus friends. But I also know that before long I
won't be part of his routine and life anymore even if I want to join
&amp;mdash; the option window …&lt;/p&gt;</summary><content type="html">&lt;figure class="col l6 m6 s12"&gt;

won't be part of his routine and life anymore even if I want to join
&amp;mdash; the option window is closing, and it's a sure defeat whether I
like it or not.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Isn't the word &lt;em&gt;defeat&lt;/em&gt; the theme of my life these days? &amp;mdash;
everything is slipping away, youth, hair, energy, ambition, my son, my
belief in love, hope in life, passion in another human being... sad,
isn't it!? The only thing I'm still having is curiosity, but even that
is becoming an issue because the more I read and think and write here,
the oftener I'm finding myself to be annoyed by shallow thoughts,
superficial comments, BS views, single-minded opinions, groundless
preference and belief (if you can call that a belief, which I think
the word is being abused to describe something much weaker than a
real belief), pride, and prejudice.... indeed, even by sitting here
and watching office people now lining up in front of the Starbucks, I
can't help wondering whether this becomes an office ritual or an
excuse to step away from desk and chat... maybe both. At least here it
doesn't bear the overblown role of being a social status icon &amp;mdash;
drinking Starbucks is a necessity now in China to be viewed as a
youth, especially if you have an office life of some sort. But not to
ignore that it does have its practical function when your daily
commute involves hours of standing in a crowded subway, and waking up
in early hours and sleep in late either because you need time to
rewind, or just out of habit to be on social media till late at night
&amp;mdash; either way, the young age affords you the level of energy and
resillience to not feel the effect, for a while, until it all catch
up w/ you during a day of your low tide, or just like me, when you are
getting old.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I digged up the old photo of myself when I was also in 6th grade, just
as Noah's age and status. Surprisingly I thought I looked a lot older
and maturer than what the reality really was &amp;larr; here I was,
squatting in the front row as a 三好学生, yet I looked just like Noah
today, probably not even so &amp;mdash; honestly I think Noah possesses a
more mature feeling than I was. How interesting! So I guess Noah isn't
too, childish, after all, as I have imagined, and this may also mean
that he will be just fine, and will be better than I am.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The other night I told him I hated when my parents compared me to some
other kids, and then, Noah cried. I have never seen him so upset. Then
he said "if you don't like that, why are you comparing me to others?"
Hard question. I noticed it that there isn't an alternative if I want
to get a sense how he is doing, I mean, what is the reference here!?
At that moment, I told him that he can either tell me more himself so
I can get the information, which essentially is to use himself, him of
yesterday, as the reference, or it leaves me no choice but to find
an external reference, which is another kid.. but deep down I also
know this is a paradox, a logic that is self-contradicting, and is
unfair to him.... But, what should I do?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I don't know. Maybe I should just buckle up, ride w/ him, however he
is going to become, and pray.&lt;/p&gt;</content><category term="thoughts"></category><category term="thoughts"></category></entry><entry><title>Emotional AI</title><link href="https://fengxia41103.github.io/myblog/emotional%20ai.html" rel="alternate"></link><published>2019-09-13T09:23:00-04:00</published><updated>2019-09-13T09:23:00-04:00</updated><author><name>Feng Xia</name></author><id>tag:fengxia41103.github.io,2019-09-13:/myblog/emotional ai.html</id><summary type="html">&lt;figure class="col l7 m7 s12"&gt;

&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While at gym, the thought just came to me, that all the talks about AI
have been about how it will obsolete human and jobs, how much
acceleration it travels in term of cracking the challenges we throw at
it/them, therefore how much we will be behind once the AI train passes
us &amp;mdash; louder, louder, louder.. and it's, gone! and we will never
catch up again, ever. Then the world will be dominated by AI and its
creations (robots?), and human, likely will become slaves, or like in
the Matrix, some sort of utilitarian object, fertilizer, maybe.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Then, the talks inevitably lead to gaps that AI can not yet do, and
even argue that they will never able to. Two common threads &amp;mdash;
language, and emotion.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Language that there are too much subtlety in our conversation (and the
Chinese especially think they are the master of such, in their eyes,
arts, in my eyes, annoyance, see my elaboration on &lt;a href="https://fengxia41103.github.io/myblog/irresponsible response.html"&gt;irresponsible

arts, in my eyes, annoyance, see my elaboration on &lt;a href="https://fengxia41103.github.io/myblog/irresponsible response.html"&gt;irresponsible
response&lt;/a&gt;), that AI/computer is yet to understand that much depth
&amp;mdash; Siri and its siblings are essentially a converter with the
Google search engine standing behind as the backend &amp;larr; they
convert audio into a string, POST to the search engine, and read back
the results.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Then, the culprit of human dignity always ends on emotion &amp;mdash;
AI/computer is viewed as an autistic kid, the rain man, they are super
smart, good at math, but they have no emotion. Too bad, therefore,
they can't become human, they will never match human, because emotion
is the crown jewel of human activity such as music, art, reading a
book, falling in love, dream, hope, imagination (the book I was
reading in Ray's ICU was about how human can develop intelligence, and
the root argument is that emotion is the enabler for a human to
develop those cold-blood capabilities &amp;mdash; logic, critical
thinking, and so on.) Since human emotion are &lt;em&gt;too complex&lt;/em&gt; to be
modeled, therefore AI can't yet, and unlikely ever will, develop such,
what should we call it, skill? trait?... anyway, so they won't never
have emotion, thus human still wins (at least it will be a 1:1
replacement).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;But&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Not only in my &lt;a href="https://fengxia41103.github.io/myblog/ai.html"&gt;AI&lt;/a&gt;, I have described two ways to measure a duck:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;they quack in the same way a duck does &amp;rarr; open mouth, vibrate
   vocal chord in frequency ABC, inhale, and so on and on..., or&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;they make a sound, however they generate them, but it came out like
   a quack.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you can't tell the result, does the process to get there matter?
But also, I think there is another gap in this discussion that so far
no one has ever touched up &amp;mdash; if AI acquires human emotion (let's
just take to the extreme, not even human like, but human identical!),
what will they be!? This, becomes interesting.&lt;sup id="fnref:1"&gt;&lt;a class="footnote-ref" href="#fn:1"&gt;1&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;unreliable&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The No.1 advantage of computer isn't even its processing power &amp;mdash;
it's its predictability!&lt;/strong&gt; It can crunch the number as fast as it
will. It will still be competely useless if the same inputs generate
different results every single run! &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So, what will emotion do to it? I think everyone can answer this
pretty easily. Every one of us is a human, and we are emotional. By
being emotional, we have good days and bad days. Asking a colleague or
a manager to review your work is a hit or miss if this person is, say,
super emotional (well, the extreme case of an emotional person will be
some insanity, isn't it!?). That's exactly why we take the pain to
codify the thoughts into computer program, into some software
controlled mechanics, so that its move, its decision making, and its
results, are &lt;strong&gt;predictable&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Therefore, will an emotional AI still be, as powerful and almighty as
we are now imagining? It will be powerful in the sense of its sheer
processing power. But it can't be a good thing at all, because it's
like giving Trump the nuclear weapon launch code and he can send them
off anytime he wants &amp;mdash; on a bad morning he might just do it! So
it will like living  w/ a emotional God, or, to ask anyone who is
still hanging on  in an unhappy marriage, it's just, misery.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;philosophy&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now, when a group of these emotional AIs get together, do they form a
community just like we do? do they then also bump into each other like
neighbours living in a crowded compound? Even better, do they then
develop the same confusion and frustration, thus producing philosophy?
What about happiness? that's a kind of emotion, isn't it? and Love? Oh
mine, that must be a slipper slop that no one has the answer.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So this world of emotional AI can go on and on, and the more you think
of it, the more you will imagine that they will behave, live, co-live,
very much like what we are doing, in a different scales and different
styles, maybe, but the fundamental questions, the philosophical
questions, that human have been developing since Socrates and onwards,
will inevitably become the same challenge for them... hmmm, I will be
curious to see whether their super brain can create some super
philosophy or philosophers, what will that be like?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Anyway. I don't think emotion is the last line of defense of human
against these machines. On the contrary, following this train of
thought, it's more of a poison pill that you want the AI to actively
swallow, so you blunt their No.1 value proposition &amp;mdash;
predictability, bring them down the same level of emotional turmoils
we are experience, and lead them into the infinite thinking process of
philosophy and, even religion... what a fun!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I started this article a few days, but didn't finish it. A few mixed
thoughts have been lingering around my mind for quite some. But they
are rather elusive &amp;mdash; they come and go, and on the moment when I
felt them, I was always busy with something else. Then by the time I
sat down to write, I couldn't think of them anymore. So let me try
them again.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is a topic I have long been writing, that I think the internet is
in trouble.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What's the value of the Internet these days? I used to think, and I
think most people will take it as the No. 1 value of the Internet, is
that it has made information (&lt;strong&gt;not knowledge, and leave alone truth,
fact, reality, those kind of words&lt;/strong&gt;) readily available at your finger
tip. But then, we do have to ask, what is the use of information? The
answer will be, it depends &amp;mdash; certainly an information of the
a sale going on in a McDonald's next door will not help you …&lt;/p&gt;</summary><content type="html">&lt;figure class="col s12"&gt;

&lt;p&gt;What's the value of the Internet these days? I used to think, and I
think most people will take it as the No. 1 value of the Internet, is
that it has made information (&lt;strong&gt;not knowledge, and leave alone truth,
fact, reality, those kind of words&lt;/strong&gt;) readily available at your finger
tip. But then, we do have to ask, what is the use of information? The
answer will be, it depends &amp;mdash; certainly an information of the
a sale going on in a McDonald's next door will not help you in any way
when your son is sick and you need to figure out how to get him to a
Doctor. I mean, measured by a particular moment, the value of
information is depending on the &lt;em&gt;prioritized need at that moment&lt;/em&gt;
&amp;mdash; you might still find the sale useful cause you also think of
your lunch or a snack for your son on the way to the
hospital. However, it is less useful because seeing a Doctor has
higher priority.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It's on this usefulness of information that people would think of the
Internet as a tool. But I think there are two issues here.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;First, assuming that the information is 100% &lt;em&gt;accurate&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;whole&lt;/em&gt; &amp;mdash;
meaning it is true to the extent anyone on this earth can possibly
perceive to include, and what is included is as correct as anyone on
this earth can possibly validate. Even so, the degree of the
usefulness varies tremendously from case to case. Let me try to rank
the &lt;em&gt;causes&lt;/em&gt; of such variation:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;How the question is formulated. I'm a firm believer of garbage in,
   garbage out. I often say that Google may have everything you will
   ever want to know. How much yo*u are getting out it is solely
   depending on your question &amp;rarr; the more pinpointed your question
   is, the more likely you will find search results &lt;em&gt;helpful&lt;/em&gt; to
   answer your question.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;How well is the information relating to your question. An easy
   example will be those double-meaning words &amp;mdash; the speaker may
   not even be aware of its ambiguity while the question is
   asked. Then, how could the Internet respond well?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;How well can the receiver use the feedbacks. This is completely a
   personal trait, and is what makes one a good/bad
   engineer/student/person, and so on.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It's the point #2 that I want to elaborate further, and is what I mean
by the degradation of the Internet's value. Reading over the articles
circulating in the friendship circle has long taught us that it will
be a nonsense to believe everything the Internet presents to us. One
can argue that &lt;strong&gt;objetive info&lt;/strong&gt; such as a selling price of a product
you searched from Google or Amazon is reliable, while a personal
relationship of a movie star with whom and whom is nothing but
gossips. But, &lt;strong&gt;how do you know?&lt;/strong&gt; In other words, what makes that
price info not a gossip (if we let these words, "info" and "gossip",
bear the distinction of a "accurate/truthful info"
vs. "untruthful/inaccurate info")?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;By a sheer logic, I would not think there is such a measure/criteria
at all one can utilize to identify one from another (well, one could
also argue that each person is himself the measure, which is also true
in a day-to-day sense), because there is nothing objective about the
target (these info) and the act (to distinguish them). Everything in
this discussion is purely, subjective. And once we agree that they are
in the subjective sphere, all bets are off &amp;mdash; I can say whatever
I want, and you can hear whatever you like &amp;mdash; it's a fair game
for all, and &lt;strong&gt;unfair&lt;/strong&gt; for all, too.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Then, what's the value of the Internet anymore than other information
channels we have &amp;mdash; your eyes, ears, newspapers, TVs, pamphlets,
bibles or any other book, lecture by your professor or by your
parents, a tale, a piece of &lt;em&gt;history&lt;/em&gt; &amp;mdash; Internet is just another
channel, grantedly much more efficient, and also much more &lt;strong&gt;free&lt;/strong&gt;
because it does not obey geo boundary, thus is transcending not only
geo bounds, but social bounds, custom bounds, ideological bounds
&amp;rarr; and why so!? how so!? Why can't, say, an internationally
distributed newspaper, achieve the same effect (let's leave out
censorship out to simplify the discussion)? One difference I can think
of is that those medias are produced by a single entity, the owner
company of that media, while whatever is circulating on the Internet
is taken to be generated by an unknown entity, a group of unknown
entities. But apparently, these anonymous authors didn't make the
material any more credible than those known authors. As a matter of
fact, the contrary is becoming true, that people are more and more
believing those &lt;strong&gt;official channels&lt;/strong&gt; (and the worst example is to
quote government releases as the ultimate source of truth) more than a
piece you pick up on the Internet. So, the democracy feature of the
Internet's information flow is actually working against itself by
making it less and less valuable as an information source!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Efficiency. Yes, the Internet still holds this edge due to its
underline technology, which, by &lt;a href="https://fengxia41103.github.io/myblog/reflection on technology.html"&gt;my own argument&lt;/a&gt;, meets one of the
three criteria to determine whether technology is an improvement over
the old ways of doing things. But the efficiency itself is neutral
&amp;larr; it accelerate the distribution of good and bad in an equally
fashion, with the equal power, and by nature will make no distinction
whatsoever, and even if it can do such thing, we don't want it to,
either &amp;mdash; because the fundamental question isn't whether it can
or can not, but by what measure it makes such judgement!? Isn't this
nature of assisting both the &lt;em&gt;good&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;bad&lt;/em&gt; causing the
&lt;a href="https://fengxia41103.github.io/myblog/social media.html"&gt;confusion&lt;/a&gt; what we are experiencing in the social medias? Yes, but
only part of it. Here is another issue.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you have used ebay and has followed its growth, you would see the
pattern that small players get &lt;strong&gt;crowded out of this space&lt;/strong&gt; gradually
and surely because they simply do not have the same level of resources
to play against big players. On the Internet, if its business is a
channel to propogate bits, its authors would eventually follow this
pattern to concentrate onto a few (and they are still measured in
millions at least) power houses &amp;mdash; it's a shout game, and whoever
owns the largest microphone and the biggest antenna, win. Receivers
will be drowned in this game by the flood of information his/her brain
needs to process before that &lt;strong&gt;subjective measure&lt;/strong&gt; can make a choice
&amp;larr; if we take the brain capacity as finite (&lt;code&gt;capacity/daily = number of
bits processed by secons * waking hours * 3600&lt;/code&gt;), then the producer
can surely saturate this capacity, thus making it useless, meaning it
will either stop to function totally, or seeing the &lt;strong&gt;error&lt;/strong&gt; rate
shoot up. We are already witness this phenomenon in the Facebook
debate. I believe this is also how propaganda works in general. Like a
Truman's world, &lt;strong&gt;how can you tell it's constructed when your info
inputs are all constructed&lt;/strong&gt;!? and to this extent, &lt;strong&gt;does it matter
whether you live in a matrix&lt;/strong&gt;?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This ia very pessimistic view. This pattern isn't new, and is being
played out again and again and again. I start to wonder whether there
is a name for such pattern, and what its solution is in a social
context? If looking up how people discussed the effect of, newspaper,
or the radio, and the TV, I'm sure I'll find these exact same
arguments, just swapping out the words to Internet, viola, don't they
sound familiar!?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So I take those as an example, it does give us a peace of mind &amp;mdash;
that the human society didn't collapse, war was not caused by having
radio or TV, marriage didn't become happier or unhappier, life in
general did become more diverse and dimensional, more entertaining,
and these stimulation translated to more creative mind (in both good
and bad), which, I still believe, is the ultimate good thing &amp;rarr; so
far, the only thing limitless is the outcome of human mind. What if it
comes up something, good!?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Peace.&lt;/p&gt;</content><category term="thoughts"></category><category term="thoughts"></category></entry><entry><title>Nagasaki</title><link href="https://fengxia41103.github.io/myblog/nagasaki.html" rel="alternate"></link><published>2019-08-26T10:28:00-04:00</published><updated>2019-08-26T10:28:00-04:00</updated><author><name>Feng Xia</name></author><id>tag:fengxia41103.github.io,2019-08-26:/myblog/nagasaki.html</id><summary type="html">&lt;div class="col s12" style="margin-right: 2em;"&gt;

&lt;p&gt;What a fine early Autumn day, nice weather, nice temperature, nice
breeze. Noah's first day to the middle school. His bus left at 7:36,
so the day all started early, which feels, great, that I have done the
gym and have checked my emails, and now can write down some thoughts
before noon. Like it, except for the mosquito who just bited me, but
unfortunately it landed on the seat next to mine, and SQUASH, it's

them a form of life also, so that by their religious code that they
shouldn't harm them either? or, they classify mosquitoes as a
different kind, like 妖魔鬼怪 in 西游记, that can be killed at will?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Talking about 西游记， this is what brought me to write this article
&amp;larr; Noah and I were riding back from Reader's Corner (btw, I picked
up a book, Russel's &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Why_I_Am_Not_a_Christian"&gt;why I am not a Christian&lt;/a&gt;, flipped through a few
pages while waiting for our take out yesterday, very interesting!), I
think we were discussing what to eat, and he said he was not hungry.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"But you didn't eat much for lunch either." I said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"So? I'm not hungry." He replied.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"你这是要成仙啊!" I commented.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"What is 仙？" He asked&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"They don't need food, they can just live, like 孙悟空。" I tried to
relate this concept to something he knows.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Then all of sudden, it got me thinking &amp;mdash; 孙悟空 is a rock, then
why does he still eat, say 蟠桃!? and even more importantly, where do
these food go!!!!? I mean, does he have a digestion system? and what
about the, waste!!? Toilet won't help, right!? does he even have those
parts, and the hole? Never thought of this. We know he had a feast on
蟠桃大会， but it was never discussed whether he processed these foods
in the same/similar way as we do (which I believe majority of the
audiences all think so!), and whether there are anything left at the
end of this process, and how he got them &lt;em&gt;out of his body&lt;/em&gt;!?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Fascinating, isn't it!? I have argued in &lt;a href="https://fengxia41103.github.io/myblog/details.html"&gt;another article&lt;/a&gt; about
how devils are truly in details, that the romance of the three kingdom
never explained/described how their massive armies were arranging to
handle human waste. Then here it is again, the all powerful monkey
king was always eager for those magical goodies, 蟠桃，仙丹，人参果,
but never had the need to either pee or poop! &amp;rarr; I guess you can
argue that he is super human, thus handle these &lt;em&gt;foods&lt;/em&gt; differently,
or that these foods converts 100% into energy of some sort, thus will
not generate waste... but then, the 2nd one is shaky, because in the
novel this guy ate all sort of things, especially when he was still
only a mafia boss in his own territory &amp;rarr; so he was eating all
kinds of &lt;strong&gt;ordinary&lt;/strong&gt; food. And even, let's say, he has upgraded his
status to have now access to these magical foods, it's up him to judge
whether this food is 100% energy, or only 80% &amp;mdash; I'm now thinking
how 猪猪 smells my food sometimes and will not even touch it, and I
was always wondering how he knew this meat/milk is fine, but the other
isn't. So I suspect the same challenge is faced by Mr.孙， how does he
know!?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Well, I know novels are fictional, and just any novel has ignored this
part of human life completely, thus it's just a convention I
guess. But a lot of time when I was reading novels, I found the author
trying very hard to describe &lt;strong&gt;details&lt;/strong&gt; with an intention to bring
viewers into the scene as if it were soooooo real! Yet they all choose
not to address this one single super important part of living &amp;mdash;
there are plenty description of feast, of hunger, of struggle for
food, of survival on scraps, but characters, especially the super
heroes, simply do not go to bathroom!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But then, reading the book &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/Nagasaki-Life-After-Nuclear-War/dp/0143109421"&gt;Nagasaki&lt;/a&gt;, the reality flies right into
your face &amp;mdash; messy, ugly, painful, full of choices that ended w/
terrible outcome, decisions that were bad or even fatal, good
intentions went nowhere, begging for help received no response... I,
like many many others, have been left with impression that the two
nuclear bombs ever dropped on real human &amp;mdash; Nagasaki and
Hiroshima, ended the war and saved lives (usually we deem them to be
American lives). Then we feel relieved and literally, moved on &amp;mdash;
moved on with our thoughts, with our discussions, with our
interests. &lt;strong&gt;I have never given it much thought to realize that even
when the war was over, the life did not.&lt;/strong&gt; For all the survivors of
the war, of course the survivors of Nagasaki, the war was over six
days later, but life didn't. When we were all cheering to draw a
period on history and ready to flip the page, the misery of these
people have just started.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Reading a book like this is, real, because when the details are being
considered, described, you see the struggle of everyday life. The same
sentiments are played when you lose someone dear, like Lei to me, that
the deceased didn't really just disappear, they left a lot for the
livings to absorb, sometimes good, heart warming, sometimes, sad,
difficult to swallow. The life is truly like a never ending stream
&amp;mdash; it goes on and on and on with or without you, or the one you
loved. But then, a moment like such trauma came, making a splash, or
changing the course completely, often in an instance, but you
have to endure its consequence for a long long long long time. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Indeed, it's easy to mark an end of, an era, a war, but how to mark
the end of, a life? Death? That's not enough, either. This makes me
now think of the cartoon &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coco_(2017_film)"&gt;Coco&lt;/a&gt; &amp;mdash; a life ends when, no one
remembers you anymore... and if I still remember, still has the
memory, can I give more life, to you!? I wish it will.&lt;/p&gt;</content><category term="thoughts"></category><category term="love"></category></entry><entry><title>Boston and other thoughts</title><link href="https://fengxia41103.github.io/myblog/boston%20and%20other%20thoughts.html" rel="alternate"></link><published>2019-08-21T10:44:00-04:00</published><updated>2019-08-21T10:44:00-04:00</updated><author><name>Feng Xia</name></author><id>tag:fengxia41103.github.io,2019-08-21:/myblog/boston and other thoughts.html</id><summary type="html">&lt;figure class="col l8 m8 s12"&gt;

&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Trip to Boston was nice, especially when I saw old friends &amp;mdash;
uncle Tam, Eddy, Bob, Doc Shen and his parents. Not that it brought
back many memories, but to see that people who have been in my life,
of whom I wish to have a good life, are doing well. I think somewhere
I have said it, that it matters more to me that the people I care
about are living well, than myself does the same. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I don't know. I have many thoughts this morning, but they come and go,
and hard to put them down. I have been thinking a lot of the last ten
years, the years since Noah came to my life. What a change! It's easy
to say that change was taken because of him. Of course he was a major
force behind these changes. But I can't help feeling there were more
&amp;mdash; some you can call destiny, some I can't describe what it is,
like a million turns I took, or anybody took, in this course called
life, that …&lt;/p&gt;</summary><content type="html">&lt;figure class="col l8 m8 s12"&gt;

&amp;mdash; some you can call destiny, some I can't describe what it is,
like a million turns I took, or anybody took, in this course called
life, that a step in this direction will lead you down to a path that,
when looking back in this time span, say, 10 years, will seem so
dramatic and different. But then, like the unbearable lightness of
being, no one can tell the cause, no one can predict the future, and
no one, can go back in time.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A nice day today, I mean, weather wise, not too hot, nice breeze. I
like this breeze. Sitting outside typing this, makes me, happy. On the
way walking over, an idea popped to my mind &amp;mdash; am I a peculiar
person? I mean, why am I thinking things in such a way that is so
different from, others? Watching people walking by at work, they get
excited by, say, the new garage, new seating space.... then, they are
all good at keeping a meeting schedule, can attend those meetings even
in some &lt;em&gt;odd&lt;/em&gt; hours, or grasping an idea of a new project
quickly. How? I mean, honestly, I just can't handle that kind of
things. In a small group, among close friends, left in a corner even
in a crowded market, I could perform well, think well, write
well. But, anything that requires a fixed schedule of routine, I seem
to have serious trouble to cope with... well, this is not true,
either. I was running the meetings w/ SH team just fine, and it was
not only productive, but I could say they were the best meetings I
have been in since being here &amp;larr; most others are just routine
bearing a name so called "scrum", but we were only following the
format rather than being practical and, useful. Well.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Where should I go next? what should I do? Had a lot of dreams the last
two nights &amp;mdash; cambodia, singapore... I dreamed a life somewhere
else, anywhere, but here. I know I want to get away, but to where?
Anywhere without you will be the same to me, equally dull, equally
colorless, equally, unhappy. I miss you. You are nowhere to be found,
but I still search for you, in dream, in mind, in the darkness of this
life. If there is such a surgery, like a heart surgery to cut off
those cancer tumors, that just go in and cut off the piece that saves
you and these memories, will that end all these, feelings? I feel I'm
just groping through day by day, aimless, like a robot, picking him
up, sending him off, watching the time go by, watching the cloud go
by, watching the people go by, watching myself, whatever is left of
me, go by.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;How funny! There are two people sitting behind me, and one is
introducing the Lenovo Open Cloud, haha. This is truly something I can
speak of, and should feel proud of. Maybe that's the peak of my
profession career, by publishing two reference architectures as first
author (well, if not to say, the only author cause I wrote 99% of the
entire content). I don't know. I just feel there is something else I
can do, something else I want to do.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What is it? Maybe I should become religious, so I can say God pls tell
me, and he will show up in the sky with him booming voice, and gives
me some directions, like "go there", "turn left".. if only, there were

city, which I have never been, and may will never be, 袅袅炊烟,
sparsed lights here and there, a city that may only resemble the days
in the 80s of China, and this song, lingering over the sky, like a
radio wave, only the ones whose heart is receptive to it, hear.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Without you I would never have heard of this song, nor would ever be
sitting here writing down these thoughts as if someday you would still
be able to read this, and know my days and my mind. How scared I am
when thinking that we will forever be apart, being ignorant to each
other's life, happy or sad. I know by the end of life it doesn't
really matter at all. I don't even know whether I will have any sense
of feeling left when I get to 80s &amp;mdash; will I be numb to emotion?
will I still, regret? will I still, tear? will I still, get sad? &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I wish I do. Really. With them, I can still feel, feel life; without
them, I would hate myself.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So here it is, a song that zoomed me right back to the days, when you
first told me about it, night or day, it is only meaningful,
beautiful, because of you.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;What is people? I thought I had it figured out, but now I start to
wonder whether I'm witnessing another make-belief episode in the human
history when an abstract word such as this being used, abused, taken
for granted, without explanation, as if everybody recognizes its
meaning, knowing its intention, understanding its logic, and accepting
its implication.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This, is troublesome, and sometimes I feel the word "troublesome" is
too light a word to describe the evil such usage is releasing &amp;mdash;
it's like a poison released in those Nazi gas chamber, odorless, even
painless. Yet, however long it takes, however &lt;em&gt;unintrusive&lt;/em&gt; it is, it
kills.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So, what is people? When I thought I figured it out, I thought the key
problem of this word is that citizen is a given right come with your
birth &amp;mdash; you are a citizen of such country, when you were born
here, or sworn in, and thus being regulated by and abiding the
country's law &amp;mdah; it's both an identity as you own a passport when
travel which says who you are …&lt;/p&gt;</summary><content type="html">&lt;figure class="col s12"&gt;

country's law &amp;mdah; it's both an identity as you own a passport when
travel which says who you are, as well the judicial obligation you are
to be measured against &amp;mdah; if you were a US citizen, you first line
of obligation is observe US law, thus defined as being a good citizen.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;People, however, is not a birth right &amp;larr; you don't become a member
of this group by coming to life. Instead, there is a &lt;em&gt;judge&lt;/em&gt; somewhere
in the hierarchy who qualifies you as part of the people, or not. And
who will be this judge!? Well, not God, but some human, who uses some
ideology as the yardstick to measure you. Therefore, every context
under &lt;strong&gt;the name of the people&lt;/strong&gt;, does not automatically apply to you,
whether good or bad, because it solely depends your status at the
moment &amp;larr; if you are a member of the &lt;em&gt;people&lt;/em&gt; then, you get the
cake (and obligations, too); if you are not (stated by this &lt;em&gt;judge&lt;/em&gt;
whom you hardly even know), well, all bets are off &amp;larr; you have
been outcasted from &lt;strong&gt;a society&lt;/strong&gt;, and the most disturbing thing human
has invented form themselves is the saying that 非我族类，其心必异
&amp;mdash; if you are not one of us, you must be one of them
(them===enemy in 99999999.999999999% of the case)!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This, is utterly insane! But everywhere you turn, you see the same
pattern being played out by all kinds of people. Even for yourself,
however honest and decent you are, or you think you are, you find this
same pattern repeated in your everyday word, everyday act, and
everyday decision:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Why do we all like friends!? Isn't a friend someone who shares the
   same point of view, or having similar interest, or however s/he
   makes you feel relaxed, secure? Like interest group we belong,
   which is being manifested by social media &amp;mdash; that I like
   reading, thus joining a reading club/channel, I like history, thus
   subscribing a history talk, and so on and so forth.... &lt;strong&gt;Aren't
   they then, 我族类?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;I always joke about women's zeal on bags, because if you pull 100
   men off the street, randomly, pick any country, any city, any age,
   any other criteria, as long as they are man, I bet 99 out 100 will
   not know what is that &lt;strong&gt;difference&lt;/strong&gt; which make the women yearn for
   between this bag versus the other! &amp;larr; same as for women looking
   at men being addictted his gears, cars, computers, gadgets, games
   &amp;mdash; what's so fun about them? Does this car really run that
   much better than the other one, because you replaced something
   called a muffler!?..... &lt;strong&gt;See, everyone of us, is, and I believe,
   have to, categorize ourselves in one group or another&lt;/strong&gt;! It's the
   only way we can ever function and go by our daily life, even though
   if you look from outside, or even from the opposite point of view,
   you find it utterly ridiculous, illogical, unexplainable, probably
   just insanity!.. &lt;strong&gt;but, why so!? and what's the alternative!?&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So words like the "people", by being such an abstract term, can be
shaped into however way you want. But the underline ingredient is not
changing &amp;mdash; we human somehow want to form a group based on shared
commonalities. Like a star being pulled by some gravity towards a
larger star, that gravity has always existed, we are just slapping
different tags on it, and in the end fooling ourselves that we have
escaped such pull, and can run free. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I used think government who likes to use the word "people" is purely
manipulating the human mind by feeding the mass a "group" which they
all think they belong to while downplaying the actual existence of
such a &lt;strong&gt;judge&lt;/strong&gt; who determines your membership. But in today's
congressional hearing of Robert Mueller, every single senate on the
committee used &lt;em&gt;American People&lt;/em&gt; in his/her statement as if this makes
the sentence indisputably correct and legit &amp;mdash; &lt;strong&gt;but then, I asked
myself, who is the American people? who is that hidden boss
determining whether I'm one, or not!? If they want to refer to all the
human living and breathing under this flag, why don't they say,
American citizen!?&lt;/strong&gt; Wouldn't it be clearer, and even stronger in
legal sense, that these people were voted to congress by citizens,
thus are responsible for citizens!?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So much I want to shout, that stop using the term "people"!! You don't
represent American people, there isn't even American people!! But
there are American citizens, who have the legal right, and all these
congressmen are employed by citizens. People.. hmmm...what if one day
that boss decides I'm not a people anymore? on what ground? I mean,
God is not determine people's membership, isn't he!? Then, who?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is a slippery slope, and everybody is volunteering to slide
down with cheers. This, is indeed a dark age, IMHO.&lt;/p&gt;</content><category term="thoughts"></category><category term="thoughts"></category></entry><entry><title>I don't think so</title><link href="https://fengxia41103.github.io/myblog/i%20dont%20think%20so.html" rel="alternate"></link><published>2019-07-05T13:41:00-04:00</published><updated>2019-07-05T13:41:00-04:00</updated><author><name>Feng Xia</name></author><id>tag:fengxia41103.github.io,2019-07-05:/myblog/i dont think so.html</id><summary type="html">&lt;figure class="col l6 m6 s12"&gt;

&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It's a common scene comparing ancient time vs. today, and the common
context of such comparison is that people in today's world, enabled by
information revolution and its technologies, is overwhelmed by these
bits in term of sensibility, thus deriving a conclusion that either we
are becoming less and less sensitive, or that we are smarter than
before. The former, however, I disagree.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It's easy to picture someone sitting in front of a TV these days and
his sense is being saturated by violence, vulgarity, and sex, the
three element that, according to &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/Problem-Media-Communication-Politics-Twenty-First/dp/1583671056"&gt;this book&lt;/a&gt;, are the forever
winner if you want to sell in a commercialist world. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;However, I have long been thinking that the so called ancient time has
been romantized in the same way that we view history in our lens
&amp;mdash; what we deem as evil and barbarian back then was not really so
if you entered a time machine and truly lived in it; same applied to
glories and achievements, and I'm sure same is true for everything
between. &lt;/p&gt;

glories and achievements, and I'm sure same is true for everything

&lt;p&gt;What jumped to my mind is the book 水浒, the Song dynasty
that so many elites these days are yearning to go back "if given me
the choice". Yet, I think everyone will then agree that if measured by
today's standard of comfort, life back then was quite harsh, if not
being outwright brutal &amp;mdash; you not only will witness beggars on
the street, poor people who were by the brink of starvation,
everywhere, but pretty commonly there would be some dead body on the
street or a fight broke out ended up with someone dead! Well, then I'm
talking about a whole pile of mess that is associated with any death
&amp;mdash; blood, body parts (think of the poor squirrels or turtles I
have been seeing all through this summer on the road run over by
traffic!), disformed body, and odor! We, today's audience, are used to
seeing death in such an abstract form projected by a LED screen that
only the sense of eye and ear are involved &amp;mdash; if even going by
the math, that is only 40% of the five senses we have equipped to
collect signals for brain. That number, if put into any other context,
would have already become suspicious if one claims a 40% represents
the whole truth!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Further, today's civilization has shielded most of us so far from such
brutality of life, especially thanks for the advance of
industrialization and ideology, that very few of us are given the
chance to experience these scenes that ancient people were living with
as a routine. How many times the book has mentioned someone being
executed in public by chopping his head off? and this isn't distant
memory at all for the entire world counting both the East and the
West! Well, if you want to talk about how traumatizing an experience a
person can sustain, watching someone being killed, even as a
bystander, is ranked high on the list for sure!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Coming from my own experience also. I recall when I was little, there
were quite a few knocks on the door when someone was going door to
door begging for food, quoted that they were refugees from some inland
states escaping from famine and hunger. No kidding. So in my
generation, in my own time, the memory of such existed, happened, and
it was very much stronger to one's brain and conscience than watching
a horror movie on your couch!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Then, there is always the BS praise of yesterday's wonders, especially
those wonder of construction in some massive scale that is hardly
imaginable in today's life with today's equipments. They are
wonders. But few, if any, of these praisers will want to live in that
time and became part of the construction force so to become a
participant, or even creator, of such wonders! It's utterly disgusting
then that China's elites are trumpeting the achievements of the past
as an evidence of the long life of the Chinese civilization, and
sometimes even singing the praise of the emperor/authority as the
genius/hero of the race, yet they hide themselves in today's
civilization knowing there is zero risk of going back in time, if they
love it so much! &lt;strong&gt;This is the definition of 叶公好龙, isn't it!?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</content><category term="thoughts"></category><category term="thoughts"></category></entry><entry><title>Self-selected bias</title><link href="https://fengxia41103.github.io/myblog/self-selected%20bias.html" rel="alternate"></link><published>2019-07-03T12:10:00-04:00</published><updated>2019-07-03T12:10:00-04:00</updated><author><name>Feng Xia</name></author><id>tag:fengxia41103.github.io,2019-07-03:/myblog/self-selected bias.html</id><summary type="html">&lt;figure class="col s12"&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I wonder, whether the bias that I feel, is actually self-selected!?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This occurred to me when I was browsing Slashdot at lunch, and started
to realize that as a pattern which applies to everybody, you will only
click into the comment for the titles you find interesting &amp;mdash;
this sounds very much legit and correct.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But, wouldn't it enforce your interest in a certain topic because,
like Noah's swimming practice, the more you practice, the better you
become. Thus, the more you read about a certain topic, which started
with a vague interest perhaps, the more you know about the content and
topic and context, the more then you find the consequent reports and
similar topics easy to understand, and more likely to provoke an
emotion, which makes you feel the topic is dearer to you than others.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Another proof of this is that when I was reading the title

at its Border&lt;/a&gt;, 216 comments &amp;mdash; this echos how I feel when I'm
using Youtube these days, and Amazon Prime &amp;rarr; the recommended list
are becoming more and more, homogeneous, and I can't help feeling that
my horizon of information is becoming narrower and narrower.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This, is indeed, disturbing! Not only that there is now external
forces, like these suggestion algorithms, but I wonder whether our own
brain is calling for this same food, thus finding comfortable when
being presented with such an &lt;strong&gt;ever-shrinking&lt;/strong&gt; diversity? A common
perception of the old is that they are not &lt;em&gt;open-minded&lt;/em&gt;, that they
are often at odds with the popular trend and &lt;em&gt;new&lt;/em&gt; things. Now I
wonder whether this is just the true nature of our brain &amp;mdash; after
years of practice following this, instinct (for lack of a better
word), one will certainly become very good at it, not mention if it is
already a built-in component, like a strong pull, in this direction,
to begin with! So the old are married with their rather fixed set of
interests, just like all of us are, and have lost energy to consume
diverse information because reading and listenning to unfamiliar
information is very taxing on your brain, and perhaps your heart
also. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So really, the problem is that a person is getting weaker and weaker
with aging, thus the brain is constantly selecting the least-resistant
path, which then translates to this tendency, and manifested as a
self-selected "bias" &amp;larr; I quoted the word &lt;code&gt;bias&lt;/code&gt; because, after
all, what is a bias, if everyone is entitled to have his/her own
opinion, and there isn't such a thing as commonly agreed right or
wrong!? Doesn't it make that my words is just as equally sound or evil
as yours.... Now I see why we need God, if only there is such a super
being who can be the judge, who can call out a right or wrong, who one
can turns to, as if we turn to a judge or policeman in life &amp;rarr; it
does feel good. Interesting.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The so called curiosity, is indeed a fire in one's mind. It gets
weaker and weaker, for whatever reason. Someone's had died down long
time ago; others become smaller flame, and still burn, for a while. I
wonder how big is my fire inside!? and when it is out, what becomes of
me? A walking dead? or just everyone else &amp;mdash; those bigfoots, when
I viewed myself as the smallfoot, a human?&lt;/p&gt;</content><category term="thoughts"></category><category term="thoughts"></category></entry><entry><title>The wrong elite</title><link href="https://fengxia41103.github.io/myblog/the%20wrong%20elite.html" rel="alternate"></link><published>2019-07-02T11:42:00-04:00</published><updated>2019-07-02T11:42:00-04:00</updated><author><name>Feng Xia</name></author><id>tag:fengxia41103.github.io,2019-07-02:/myblog/the wrong elite.html</id><summary type="html">&lt;figure class="col s12"&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Hmmm... this &lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dTEHB6fOFWc"&gt;video&lt;/a&gt; is very...disturbing.. and the comments below
are even more so, disturbing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Before anything, I think this person is a thinker. It's actually very
good, and I think he is very smart and observant, and he certainly is
not following some made recipe &amp;rarr; he is formulating a logic of his
own, which he intentionally (and I think he is very much like me) to
be different from others'. I usually will very much enjoy someone like
this. But, but, his view point, well, is putting me off, completely.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;Geo type&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Number one, he has a completely wrong view by making a statement that
US is behaving irresponsibly because it has the gene of a &lt;em&gt;pirate&lt;/em&gt;
&amp;larr; because this country is next to oceans, and its counterpart is
those countries on land such as France and Germany. This, is
ridiculous!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;First of all, US territory is HUGE! It's comparable in size with any
of these so called land countries &amp;mdash; China, Russia... In

France …&lt;/p&gt;</summary><content type="html">&lt;figure class="col s12"&gt;

&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Hmmm... this &lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dTEHB6fOFWc"&gt;video&lt;/a&gt; is very...disturbing.. and the comments below
are even more so, disturbing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Before anything, I think this person is a thinker. It's actually very
good, and I think he is very smart and observant, and he certainly is
not following some made recipe &amp;rarr; he is formulating a logic of his
own, which he intentionally (and I think he is very much like me) to
be different from others'. I usually will very much enjoy someone like
this. But, but, his view point, well, is putting me off, completely.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;Geo type&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Number one, he has a completely wrong view by making a statement that
US is behaving irresponsibly because it has the gene of a &lt;em&gt;pirate&lt;/em&gt;
&amp;larr; because this country is next to oceans, and its counterpart is
those countries on land such as France and Germany. This, is
ridiculous!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;First of all, US territory is HUGE! It's comparable in size with any
of these so called land countries &amp;mdash; China, Russia... In
particular, it's so much greater, I mean, in square miles, than
France, Germany, that if the statement can qualify those two countries
as so called having the &lt;strong&gt;land gene&lt;/strong&gt;, the US will have to bear the
same category &amp;rarr; US is as much as land mass as any of the
countries he is referring to in his talk. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It's not the gene of the land that drives the policy and decisions,
it's the need to expand (eg. Japan) or to defend your neighbour's
expansion (anyone who has been invaded) that has always been the
driving factor! Yes your geo will make this task easy or difficult,
but the location is much of a God send -- well, you don't decide where
your country lands on earth (in a high-level sense, that's why
countries fight, so to find a better piece of grass!), just like not
much you can decide who your parents are. Think about another case
here, Poland, the poor country has been poorly defended because it is
caught in between the Germany and the Russian. But why the two
countries want to take over Poland instead of leaving it as a buffer
zone between the two giants!?  Wouldn't it be better to fight in
someone else' home instead of your own!?... So my point is,
&lt;strong&gt;expansion has a much deeper motivation than just a shallow view of
continental type vs. oceanary type&lt;/strong&gt;. In Poland's case, the
racial/tribal factor and the religious factor have been the real
reason why Russia want to take that land, and even there has been the
historical bully vs. bullied sentiments (that Poland land owner was
really harsh on Russians back then) that played a lot more important
role in the experience of this country than anything else.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;you are born bad&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Further, such view point is the same as saying that you are bad guy
because you were born in the wrong family &amp;larr; doesn't this sound
familiar, to any Chinese who are above age 30!? This is entirely
ridiculous as far as anyone can reason! I think it's reasonable to
have a view that all states are born evil, or all capitalists are bad
blood.. that's totally fine, which also makes the whatever derived
conclusion shaky if such view point is weak &amp;larr; and to me, and I
hope to many many others, this view point is not only weak, but is
entirely, &lt;strong&gt;wrong&lt;/strong&gt;! History has proven this over and over, and as a
Physicist, as he claims himself to be, this is the same as saying that
Earth is the center of the universe, not because we can prove it to
be, but because all my previous generations say so! ... No! No!
No!... you are all welcomed to make such assumption/statement, but it
doesn't fulfills itself. You need proof, and I mean, sufficient proof,
to back up this statement, and often enough, even in Physics, it is
the cross-checks that will prove or disprove a statement. If we
cross-check US, say, its historical performance/treatment of other
countries or ppl or whatever, wouldn't you then draw the opposite
conclusion from what he just said, that US will be the evil, just like
any other empires that had failed the human race!? &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If we do a cross check, I would say that China will not even see
today's achievements without the US, or Japan, or Europe, or many many
others that are outside China, non Chinese citizens &amp;rarr; thinking of
today's wonder as if China has single-handedly made them happen is
just, completely wrong! So, does it make the US good? bad? .. you tell
me.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;ignoring history completely&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It's really strange to use the, what I would call &lt;strong&gt;bogus math&lt;/strong&gt;, to
back up a statement &amp;mdash; it took Turky the empire &lt;code&gt;1,900&lt;/code&gt; years to
achieve what China has achieved in 29 years.... and!? Can this then
lead to the conclusion that China is sooo much better than Turky in
history!? Of course not!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is the exact version of the story we have all known when we were
little, that a guy eats donuts to fill hunger. When he gets to the
10th one, he feels satisfied, then his conclusion is that he could
have skipped all the nine ones and just eat the last one to have the
same effect!!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This logic ignores the fact that what is being compared carries
completely different weight when viewed 500 years ago vs. now &amp;mdash;
it is an everyday cliche to have wifi and iPhone, but back to 500
years ago these will be the sci-fi maniac talk! So using such a logic
to illustrate how stupid the history was is just, bizarre! Imagine a
high school student makes a statement that "look, I know how the earth
works in one class, and it took Greeks and Newton thousands of years
to figure it out, how smart I am!!!!" Wouldn't you find it, funny!?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;China's achievement is based on an accumulation of all the wisdoms and
trial-and-errors that other countries have done, including some
humanity disasters this world has seen, I'm thinking about Russia's
social experiment... this is the same when any kid disregard the
effort of the family, friends, parents, teachers, society have put in
to make his success, and simply say "look how hard I have worked, and
therefore I deserve everything I have" ... this is not only naive,
this is purely irresponsible and selfish. Period.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;race to the bottom&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is the worst of all logic. He keeps using examples of Great
Britain and how it broke up w/ US, and US's civil war to justify how
evil US will be we let them help us. Whenever he challenges the views
of other economists who supports US's critism of China's unfair play,
his logic always quotes "look how bad you have been, so stop critizing
me" approach &amp;larr; this is what I call the &lt;strong&gt;race to the bottom&lt;/strong&gt;
method, and it is terrible! This logic links back the basis of his
argument that because you have done something evil in the past, you
will always be evil. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Even more disturbing is that he essentially spins the logic that China
shouldn't play by rules because the bullies (the US and its allies)
defined the rules &amp;mdash; this can be extended to just any scenario in
life, that the rapist is innocent because, well, why did you wear that
type of revealing clothes!?.... come on, get a grip, really. There
will always be rules, and someone get to define them. There is nothing
wrong with this fact. You can disagree the rules and change them, but
by just quoting the rules themselves are the root of evil is completly
circular logic &amp;mdash; again, this is the equivalent to say that you
are a bad guy because, well, you were born by bad parents, and so you,
and your children and children's children will be just as bad.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;self-contradicting, everywhere&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The entire logic is just self-contradicting! He claims is the theory
that the rise and fall of an &lt;em&gt;empire&lt;/em&gt; is like a body flushing through
cycles. Sure, I take that. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But then, if this is driving the conclusion that thus US is being
flushed out and China is taking over, wouldn't China be in the exact
same position as the US in, say, 10 years!? Then what!? Doesn't this
theory then predict China will then start to fall!? But, this isn't
the message he is going with, is this!?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;How convenient then that he just say, "hey, look, I won't live that
long, and you guys will witness this"... he likes quoting Karl
Max. Max's theory is truly comprehensive that it describes/predicts
the entire cycle of a society, and essentially after Communism, there
isn't none exist, it's the end of road, paradise. But his, by exactly
establish the cycle as he is so proud of, predicts the inevitably fall
of the rise of China, and he &lt;strong&gt;did not address a single line&lt;/strong&gt; how
China should act differently to &lt;strong&gt;break this cycle&lt;/strong&gt;.. or, should I
even call what it actually is, &lt;strong&gt;the curse&lt;/strong&gt;!?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Further, there is always an implication the world is split between
China and the rest, or the US vs. the rest..... he quotes US as if US
people are an unity, therefore whatever technology US has developed is
only by the US people, which are different from, say, the Chinese! How
ignorant this view is!! Especially as a Physicist, this is rather
strange he perceives the world in such a way &amp;mdash; isn't US an
aggregation of, I don't know, hundreds of nationalities, races,
backgrounds, and so on!? Isn't what the technology is, especially the
cutting edge ones, the fruit of brains and collaborations in an
international scale!? Even the ones he is so proud of &amp;mdash; 北斗, or
building jets, are nothing short of a phenomenon that the world is
flat!? &lt;strong&gt;Again, by seeing everything on the foundation of a foreign
origin (physics, mathematics, computer science), and drawing the
conclusion that "I'm the 牛屄est", is just insane&lt;/strong&gt;!!! US, China, any
country, is a mix of a lot of different people and ideas. Assigning
credits to a country is simply wrong &amp;mdash; I would say, forget about
describing these things along the line of a country or state or
government. Rather, it's a matter of a stack of brilliant minds that
moved the entire human race forward to what we have today, regardless
the border lines.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Thirdly, he opened his line by saying that the trade war is not a war of
ideology, but then eventually derives to the discussion that China
should ban anyone who "helps US building infrastructure" because it is
a traison &amp;larr; isn't this ideological!?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Last but not the least, it's fine to feel proud of yourself, but it is
not fine to look down your peers/competitors/losers, especially when
the word used is &lt;strong&gt;文明 (civilization)&lt;/strong&gt;! No, China is &lt;strong&gt;not&lt;/strong&gt; the
only civilization that still beats and kicks and feeling lively. All
these long-life civilizations &amp;mdash; Greek, Indian, or Slavonic, or
Russian, or Native Indian, are just as wonderful and amazing as any,
and &lt;strong&gt;they are not dead!!&lt;/strong&gt; What an arrogant view when he thinks only
China is carrying the human torch, like Noah, while everyone else is
lying dead!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;Last words&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;..... Haven't written something like this for a while. I have to say,
I admire his confidence, but disagrees completly his arguments. I
won't have the same level of logical organization of materials and
thoughts, but I know I will not get to his conclusions, none &amp;larr;
actually knowing this makes me, happier now.&lt;/p&gt;</content><category term="thoughts"></category><category term="thoughts"></category></entry><entry><title>Another Friday</title><link href="https://fengxia41103.github.io/myblog/another%20friday.html" rel="alternate"></link><published>2019-06-28T11:17:00-04:00</published><updated>2019-06-28T11:17:00-04:00</updated><author><name>Feng Xia</name></author><id>tag:fengxia41103.github.io,2019-06-28:/myblog/another friday.html</id><summary type="html">&lt;figure class="col s12"&gt;

&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I don't know how to put today. Another Friday, sunny, humid, hot. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is the last day for many who were affected from last round of
layoff. Ran into a couple people I know yesterday and this morning.
Though I barely know any of them personally or through
work. Nonetheless, they are familiar faces, and seeing something,
someone, familiar to disappear from your life must be, and is, sad. I
sat down with them to exchange emails, phone numbers, talked to them
about the hirings our team is looking for, encouraging them to send me
their resume and I will forward them, and can certainly provide more
information regarding these positions and the project if they are
interested in &amp;mdash; I just wish there were something I could do, to
make their life better? or to just soften the blow? am I again

ignorant? I don't know. It's just part of me &amp;mdash; I …&lt;/p&gt;</summary><content type="html">&lt;figure class="col s12"&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I don't know how to put today. Another Friday, sunny, humid, hot. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is the last day for many who were affected from last round of

guessing their feelings based on mine, which, on the bright side, is
called sympathy, on the flip side is called arrogant and even
ignorant? I don't know. It's just part of me &amp;mdash; I hate to see
people around me sad, wish I could make things better, while, a lot of
times, I feel I'm the saddest among them all, though I appear to be so
upbeat and comfortable.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;m43&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A lot things are going through my mind this morning, a lot of them. I
don't know why. M43. Uploaded Noah's graduation pictures and videos
finally. They looked totally fine when viewed on computer, but for
whatever the reason they looked totally crappy on the camera's
screen. Sometimes I even suspect that the camera's screen has such a
high resolution, that it makes the pictures look very much pixelated,
while in reality the photo is such a high resolution that they look
perfectly smooth and, &lt;strong&gt;sharp&lt;/strong&gt;, when being squeezed to laptop size,
not to mention they will look simply gorgeous when printed on that
tiny 4x6. I have been struggling to find the same level of pleasure
shooting m43 comparing to the D70 or the D300 I recently purchased as
2nd hand from B&amp;amp;H. Somehow, I feel the Nikon pictures look so much,
photo-like, than M43's. Maybe it's because my eyes have been so used
to viewing these Nikon photos that even the M43's are better,
technically speaking, my brain doesn't appreciate them as such. So
that led to read and listen to M43 lens talks, discussions, and ebay
listings, even the thought of a switching back to some autofocus lens
made for M43 will bring back that photo look. Yet, these Noah pictures
looked just fine, even with my Nikon eyes, they look, very nice
&amp;mdash; sharp, momentary, pretty. I think what I need is just a trust
to my gear, to my decision, and to myself.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;human and contradictions&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Another thought. Human is full of, I mean, full of,
contradictions. Taking any so called train of thoughts, I find the
logic very shaky if to take a close examination of the reasonings. In
particular, I am referring to the common wisdom that is used to
support such reasonning &amp;mdash; these wisdoms are used as if they
themselves are the perpetual truth (because they are so aligned with
your common sense). I was thinking, when, say, a manager of a team
makes a decision &amp;rarr;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;the Chinese team commonly justifies this that this is efficient
   &amp;rarr;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;then, if we continue this reasoning, a common wisdom says &lt;em&gt;there is
   no free lunch&lt;/em&gt;, which we all agree, right, thus if we do gain
   efficiency, what price are we paying &amp;rarr;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;certainly, democracy, since not everyone is participating the
   decision. But, who says democracy is a good thing? Isn't this also
   a common wisdom? Because by positioning it as &lt;em&gt;the price we pay&lt;/em&gt;,
   we are basing on the idea that democracy is, good. So here is one
   shaky spot. Let's continue &amp;rarr;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;what about 少数服从多数？ Isn't this also a common wisdom? but we
   have also heard the &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tyranny_of_the_majority"&gt;tyranny of the majority&lt;/a&gt;, or even, 真理总是
   掌握在少数人手里, and with my getting older, I do feel the majority
   of the mass are indeed, pretty clueless and ignorant. So between
   these two already contradicting wisdoms, I'm leaning towards the
   latter &amp;rarr;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;but then, with such single decision maker pattern, wouldn't it be
   root of all troubles, say, we happen to have an unwise manager!?
   Even in technical term I'm constantly dealing with the single point
   of failure. Then, what's the remedy here? &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This reasoning goes on and on and on, and my point is, that these
wisdoms themselves are already the flip side of each other, thus
shouldn't be, and couldn't be, all true. Therefore, by plugging them
into a train of thought to support a view or a conclusion is both
convenient, satisfying, and &lt;strong&gt;misleading&lt;/strong&gt;. I don't how to resolve
this pattern, sometimes I even suspect the entire language and
communication are built-in to have this pattern &amp;larr; otherwise,
communication will not even happen. So it's like an inherent defect in
your gene. Nothing you can do about... well, just thought of another
common wisdom right here &amp;mdash; your strength is also your weakness
&amp;rarr; thus, this defect must also be the strength of human, I guess.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;late night show&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Listening to late night in the sun is an interesting experience. She
has a good voice, really. I can't imagine her age can already speak of
life in such a fashion. But I admire this, whether this is a staged
show or out of her own mind. She has many good points, and she feels,
real. Listening to these can't help me make me think of you. It has
been a month now since I wrote you last time, the longest period I
have ever had. Not that the emotion has faded and you don't come
across my mind as often. No. You are there, still, all the time. I
can't tell how many times you were in my sleep, when I was in gym, or
playing guitar, or writing blogs, or cooking, or staring at Noah, or
drinking coffee in the morning, or sitting in the sun wishing you were
there, too... too many times, too constant, too real.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The feeling of loss is terrible, and I choose not to look at it, as if
it doesn't exist, as if it can be different, as if you are still
nearby, close to, and missing me, too. But it's ok. I still think the
reality of the outcome is better this way, even though the sentiments
are crushing for me... I'm too old for you, and I will never never
want to burden you to take care of me, when my body is failing, and
even my mind might be failing... No! It's not to leave you with an
image of health and all that... It's just practical. Aging is such an
unpleasant journey as I'm seeing it right now, that I would rather go
through it alone. Like a dark tunnel with a dead end, it comforts me
to have a company, sure, but once I die and you need to turn back to
find way out again, I'll be worried. So my love, this is better, go
have a full life the way you wish and can. Just letting me to keep you
on the mind is good enough for me.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On my dying breath, I wish the thought of you will be the last thread
leaving me. Let me think of the past, live in the past, and die, in
the past, because that's where you were.&lt;/p&gt;</content><category term="thoughts"></category><category term="love"></category></entry><entry><title>Venezuela</title><link href="https://fengxia41103.github.io/myblog/venezuela.html" rel="alternate"></link><published>2019-06-26T09:29:00-04:00</published><updated>2019-06-26T09:29:00-04:00</updated><author><name>Feng Xia</name></author><id>tag:fengxia41103.github.io,2019-06-26:/myblog/venezuela.html</id><summary type="html">&lt;figure class="col l5 m5 s12"&gt;

&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A country I only know by its name, Venezuela. Yet it's on the NPR news
these days, and the country is going through some terrible times. The
world feels, turbulent, really &amp;mdash; US policy is aggressive that
it's on &lt;em&gt;war&lt;/em&gt; with China, with Iran, with just about everybody, and
there are human disasters, as always, like in this poor Venezuela.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The news mentioned the word, social fabric. This gets me thinking,
more and more these days with a growing age, that the society feels
like a living organ, a living thing, that, like an individual's body,
changes all the time, aging, perhaps, but more accurately, adapting,
constantly, so the word, the form that we know of today, will be so
different 10 years down the road, that some of them even become the
complete opposite! If individual human is already complex, then how
can an aggregation of a lot of them, thus a society, becomes any less
complex? It should only manifest the complexity with more combination
possibilities, therefore more varieties, more alternative path of
execution …&lt;/p&gt;</summary><content type="html">&lt;figure class="col l5 m5 s12"&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The news mentioned the word, social fabric. This gets me thinking,

complete opposite! If individual human is already complex, then how
can an aggregation of a lot of them, thus a society, becomes any less
complex? It should only manifest the complexity with more combination
possibilities, therefore more varieties, more alternative path of
execution, and more outcomes/consequences. Maybe there is a
probability one can compute to describe these outcomes. Yet, even so,
it is probability, which inherently means that it is not
deterministic, thus is &lt;em&gt;not predictable&lt;/em&gt; (in the sense what we hope a
prediction means).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If rolling back a few years I think I would love to go into social
study. I don't know whether they actually teach or analyze, or some
smart person has already established a theory on this scale, that can
help me to understand better what I see and hear in the news and in
life. Nonetheless, this is a fascinating topic, actually I think it's
a much more important topic than, say, am learning Angular for
work. It is more important because it &lt;strong&gt;is closer to&lt;/strong&gt; my life, or a
bigger, more direct impact on people's life, than just me  knowing yet
another programming language and can write an app or two. Maybe this
itself is a sign of my ignarance &amp;mdash; that the grass is always
greener on the other side. I remember this delivery kid in SH metro
while I was sitting on the bench waiting for her. He looked at me
working on the Project Euler problem on my laptop with a strong
interest. since the laptop itself was not nothing fancy, I would
assume his interest came from his curiosity, and maybe the look of the
screen with a few line of codes and such which he perceived as
computer programming, which to him is either a thing of strange, or a
thing of mystery. In either case, for those who don't do computers
certainly think programmers are nothing short of a magician (though,
they think the trick is darn cheap that they can buy them one dime a
dozen!).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So the same applies to my view of the social study, and potentially
some smart genius in that field that has the knowledge and tooling and
experience to solve a social problem, which, to me as an outsider, is
completely amazing, magic, and how wonderful! This makes me wonder,
what if I stick to my own trade, using the tools I know, and the
knowledge I have, wouldn't I achieve the same by moving the social
needle, just a bit, that to the direction I think it's good for the
people? Why not?... I'm not thinking of some social media page
advocating my political view or revolutionary agenda, but something
much smaller, something that is so remote to its effect that there
isn't even a way to measure so that I can only operate in the dark
without ever knowing how much the needle was moved. Wouldn't it still
make my work purposeful? wouldn't it still motivate me? and even it
still do in both questions, since I don't have a so called &lt;em&gt;direction&lt;/em&gt;
to guide me, how and what should I be working on then?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In many ways I think we have romantized the &lt;em&gt;good-old-days&lt;/em&gt;, that as
if people back then were so in touch with his/her surroundings (by
thinking that their physical and social territory was much much much
confined than ours), that they could always link their actions to a
cause and to a consequence. I would strong challenge this view. I
still believe the core of this statement lies in information flow
&amp;mdash; if the scope was indeed smaller than we have now, the
information flow was also much limited and vague. Thus, proportionally
an individual, most of them, was also in the dark, and was only
coasting by life, and probably wondering what the meaning of life is,
like I do &amp;mdash; the difference would be that they wrote with brush
and ink, and I'm now typing in a computer (which, in 100 years?, will
be in the same category as brush &amp;amp; ink, and that would not surprise me
a bit!).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So after all these derivations, there isn't answer, there isn't even a
clue. If we think the Dark Age is a European thing in the past, I
would have to say that, as of today, as of now, I feel, myself is
still living in a Dark Age. So is this world, certainly so for the
people in Venezuela, and for anyone who still suffers from seemingly
the basic struggle of food, shelter, safety, being with loved one (not
to mention all the broken hearts from regular loves!)...&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I don't know. Something is terribly wrong with this world, with the
state of human, with myself. Just that I don't know what it is, why it
is so, and what change is needed &amp;rarr; such a sense of being powerless.&lt;/p&gt;</content><category term="thoughts"></category><category term="thoughts"></category></entry><entry><title>Make passport photo in Gimp</title><link href="https://fengxia41103.github.io/myblog/make%20passport%20photo%20in%20gimp.html" rel="alternate"></link><published>2019-06-23T18:59:00-04:00</published><updated>2019-07-05T21:15:00-04:00</updated><author><name>Feng Xia</name></author><id>tag:fengxia41103.github.io,2019-06-23:/myblog/make passport photo in gimp.html</id><summary type="html">&lt;figure class="col l5 m5 s12"&gt;
  &lt;img src="images/temperature.jpg"/&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Once a while I need to make a 2x2 for official document such as
passport. It's annoying if I need to go CVS paying $15 for a digital
while myself owns a whole bunch of lenses and am proud of myself of
taking good photos.. well, I guess this is exaggerated feeling, it's
like saying that doctors shouldn't let other doctors treat them. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ok. So out of curiosity, I have always fallen back to GIMP to make a
4x6, thus 6 of 2x2, and print it for like 27 cents. So much
satisfying! But since I don't do this for a living, it's totally new
each time I need to do this. So, let's write this down once for all,
so I can look it up next time, quickly.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Steps is straightforward:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Pick a photo with not-too-noisy background, because we will select
   using the &lt;a href="https://docs.gimp.org/en/gimp-tool-iscissors.html"&gt;intelligent scissor&lt;/a&gt; in GIMP. So the more contrast or
   clean the person is in this photo, the easier.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Select scissor (&lt;code&gt;i&lt;/code&gt;) and be patient. Close the loop by click left
   mouse …&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;</summary><content type="html">&lt;figure class="col l5 m5 s12"&gt;
  &lt;img src="images/temperature.jpg"/&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Pick a photo with not-too-noisy background, because we will select

   clean the person is in this photo, the easier.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Select scissor (&lt;code&gt;i&lt;/code&gt;) and be patient. Close the loop by click left
   mouse on the very first point &amp;larr; the mouse icon will change
   when you hover over that point. But honest, the point is so small
   that I can hardly follow it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Click &lt;strong&gt;anywhere&lt;/strong&gt; inside the loop &amp;larr; this is the step I keep
   forgetting. By doing so, the selection will blink with dash line,
   now we are in business.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Paste selection into a &lt;code&gt;new&lt;/code&gt; file. Now you should see only the
   selection, with like transparent background.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Crop (&lt;code&gt;r&lt;/code&gt;) to a roughly square shape &amp;rarr; this is the step you
   can position your head in the way that passport photo wants &amp;mdash;
   so much for the head room, show some shoulders:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There is a tiny reading at the right bottom of the window when you
resize the crop overlap, eg. &lt;code&gt;0.98:1&lt;/code&gt;, so you are aiming for &lt;code&gt;1:1&lt;/code&gt;
to be square. Don't worry if it's not mathematically square, just
approximation is fine.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Some math (&lt;a href="http://www.robotgeek.org/articles/passport_tutorial/tutorial.html"&gt;reference&lt;/a&gt;). Measure (&lt;code&gt;m&lt;/code&gt;) from the top of your
   head/hair to the bottom of your chin &amp;rarr; 1172 pixels, for
   example &amp;rarr; resolution of the new photo = &lt;code&gt;1172/1.1875 = 987
   (pixels/in)&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Create a new image:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;size: 6 x 4 in&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Under &lt;code&gt;Advanced&lt;/code&gt;, resolution to &lt;code&gt;987&lt;/code&gt; (see step above) &amp;larr;
  ignore the warning that you are creating some 200+M file. It's ok.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;code&gt;Image&lt;/code&gt; &amp;rarr; &lt;a href="https://docs.gimp.org/2.10/en/gimp-image-configure-grid.html"&gt;Configure grid&lt;/a&gt;, sec to 2x2 in, and &lt;code&gt;view&lt;/code&gt; to show
   grid. Tried grid offset to 10px, can't see the difference.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Select ALL of the cropped new photo (step #4), copy and paste, six
   times, in the grids. You see the result now.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Grid line won't print. Use &lt;code&gt;Filters &amp;gt; Render &amp;gt; Pattern &amp;gt; Grid&lt;/code&gt; to
    add an exact grid line overlay (will be printed as a light gray
    line, perfect!):&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;width: &lt;code&gt;1 px&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;spacing: &lt;code&gt;2 in&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;offset: &lt;code&gt;10 px&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Save the &lt;code&gt;.xcf&lt;/code&gt; file (as source), and export to a JPG.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now just find a place and print a 4x6. Done, done, done!!&lt;/p&gt;</content><category term="thoughts"></category><category term="thoughts"></category></entry><entry><title>China's Opportunity</title><link href="https://fengxia41103.github.io/myblog/opportunity.html" rel="alternate"></link><published>2019-06-08T17:34:00-04:00</published><updated>2019-06-08T17:34:00-04:00</updated><author><name>Feng Xia</name></author><id>tag:fengxia41103.github.io,2019-06-08:/myblog/opportunity.html</id><summary type="html">&lt;figure class="col l6 m6 s12"&gt;

sunflower. It was a fine plant, growing already about 5 feet tall now,
and seems going strong. Looking closely at the wound, I think the stem
had a bite mark when it was little, likely from the same offender who
bited all the other sunflowers to death when they were young. So now
growing tall and started to become top heavy, we noticed it was
tilting this morning. Noah built a small support (duck taped together
with two sticks) earlier. But when he tried to correct it even
further, it snapped. This is an accident waiting to happen, not
entirely really his fault at all. But he doesn't link these dots yet,
and that's the pitfall of both why this is upsetting, and why I am
using it as an opportunity to learn a lesson &amp;mdash; accidents will
happen. Some you can recover from, but there are others you can do
nothing about. So it's better to be careful up front to avoid
accidents. That's all one can do, and is all one should do, and when
accident happens, all will be too late.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Sorry Noah. I understand this is upsetting. I really do. I want to
give you some console. But at the mean time, learning the reality of
this is more important and valuable than having a shoulder to lean on
so to pass it quickly &amp;larr; I won't be there all the time. So don't
count on a shoulder of others. Instead, become smarter, wiser, calmer,
it will be much better that way for you, than hoping someone will fix
it for you.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;Huawei's backup and weak logics&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Already wrote &lt;a href="https://fengxia41103.github.io/myblog/cup of joe.html"&gt;about Huawei&lt;/a&gt;. Had a few more lunch conversation w/
colleagues, all Chinese living here. The consensus is uniform, that
Huawei is bluffing &amp;larr; if their backups are so good, why haven't
they been using them already? &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I feel this logic is actually interestingly, bad! Here is why.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;First of all, this is a sneaky way to argue. This same logic can be
applied to any discussion to shoot down or diminish your opponent's
point by saying that if you already had it, why didn't you show it or
use it already? Well, there isn't a requirement that one &lt;strong&gt;must use
it&lt;/strong&gt; when it's available, right? Regardless how weak this question
itself is (which I'll discuss more in the next section), still, there
isn't such a hard line in the ground. Therefore, logically, I do mean
logically, there is nothing wrong w/ Huawei deliberately not using
what they already have, but to pay royalties to Qualcomm and others so
to &lt;em&gt;put itself in a vulnerable position&lt;/em&gt; as ppl now perceive. &lt;strong&gt;This
is the same argument that there isn't anything wrong with one choosing
not to marry, or married but not to have kids, or marrying the same
sex, or even his/her pet!!&lt;/strong&gt; &amp;larr; it's the speaker's underline
assumption that such requirement exists, though is rational, but
itself doesn't define good/bad, right/wrong, and does not rule out
these alternatives. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Second, if this logic is so true and sufficient, this makes it
impossible to &lt;strong&gt;develop&lt;/strong&gt; and make new discovery then! Think about
it. Before the discovery of North America, ppl (and probably majority
of all ppl) did follow this exact logic, didn't they? that if there
were another piece of land still undiscovered, we would have
discovered by now already! and in science, this would be the same
argument that &lt;strong&gt;if xyz exists (say, some quantum matter a theory
spells out), we would have seen it already&lt;/strong&gt; &amp;mdash; well, we all know
this logic doesn't stand, of course. It can't be. The loophole &lt;strong&gt;in
the verb&lt;/strong&gt; actually &amp;rarr; this quantum matter does exist, just that
the "see" is different from what we know! So was North America, just
that we didn't know because the ships were not good enough to get
there! So, replay this to Huawei's argument, dismissing their backups
using this logic is at most, weak. They may very well have developed a
secret weapon that is so powerful and awesome, and no one has yet
&lt;em&gt;seen&lt;/em&gt; it &amp;mdash; it's the problem of my eye, not them bluffing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I want to point out these two aspects of weakness of this argument,
because they are everywhere!! &amp;mdash; we use them in arguing whether
there is alien, whether a person is worth his salt (if he is so good,
he must have fortune and fame by now!), and so on... the &lt;code&gt;not B
&amp;amp;rarr; not A = A &amp;amp;rarr; B&lt;/code&gt;, but to proving either side, itself must be
sufficient. Otherwise, both sides are insufficient. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;China's opportunity and nationalism&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But now back to the consensus, logics might have been a weak one, the
conclusion is correct. I do think Huawei is bluffing, and I think all
the Chinese articles and talks I have been seeing and hearing are
being irresponsible by &lt;strong&gt;not making this harsh conclusion&lt;/strong&gt; that
points right to Huawei's nose! Forget about the marketing scheme that
this failure is also an opportunity &amp;mdash; it's the same speaking to
someone who just lost a job that now it's an opportunity for you to
start a new career (or to pursue your dream). Fxxx you. It is only
opportunity if this person has a dream in mind, has been waiting for
such moment, has some practice of it already, and is willing to take
this "opportunity". What would you call someone who just kicked a
non-swimmer into the water and say, hey now it's your opportunity to
learn swimming!!?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Same here for China and its IT (let me use the broad jargon "IT" for
ease of writing) &amp;larr; &lt;strong&gt;I totally believe they are not
ready. Period.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Take a view from the end of user, the product itself represents a
stack of many layers deep in term of technology. In Huawei's case, let
me just focus on the software aspect of this stack.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For it's chips, design is written in software (eg. verilog), compiled
and simulated in software (according to a talk, all of them are
developed by US companies). Move on to operating system,
libraries/modules, opensource tools, applications, I believe they can
develop applications (but even this is a problem, because one single
company developing software for its own platform has been proven to
fail in the context of mobile apps &amp;larr; you just can't compete with
world's talents, all the app developers who are outside your company,
regardless how big and powerful you are!). But for all the techs on
this stack, Huawei not only doesn't own them, it will have zero chance
to &lt;strong&gt;re-invent&lt;/strong&gt; them (as many of the supporters believe), let alone
implementing the entire stack from scratch! No, way.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Then, taking all these to the ground zero, I say the picture is simply
bleak &amp;mdash; all the advanced theories and practices are being rolled
out in the US, and there is one thing I joked about before, but am
darn serious about its implication &amp;mdash; &lt;strong&gt;every single code you can
see, is written in, English!!!!&lt;/strong&gt; For those hotheads who are patriotic
and nationalistic, this is one thing that kills your argument 100 to
0! &amp;mdash; Language is for description, and description is driven by a
way of thinking, a view of the world. Therefore, by writting code in
English, dev must be adopting the non-Chinese view and logic, and the
better a programmer you are, the more so you must be!!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Since no company, let alone Huawei, can invent another programming
language in Chinese, the so called opportunity so China is cut off
from the rest of the world and 自己玩, is really, an
impossibility. Regardless how it sounds hurting and is against their
wills, not only I believe US and China are relying on each other and
should be so going forward, by many many practical considerations, but
I find it totally annoying and pretentious when these ppl trumpet
national sentiments when the underline reality is that the new
shinning opportunity are still implemented in &lt;strong&gt;your enemies'
language&lt;/strong&gt; (and actually by these enemies' theory and videos and
books.....) Don't they feel ashamed then!?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Well, I can see what their argument will be &amp;mdash; see, we defeat our
enemy using their own weapon. How ever more so satisfying!!... so
really, when someone can look at a logic paradox in such a fashion,
there isn't anything s/he can not believe, and will not
advocate. After all, they pay the lip service, gain attention and
maybe personal gains, and reality always fits in their model,
magically, &lt;strong&gt;so they will never be wrong&lt;/strong&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1&gt;Huawei, and technology&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now, talk about this recent news of Huawei. Guannan responded with
questions and some of his thoughts. I really enjoy communicating with
him so to learn what he thinks, and to just witness that he shows
interests in this, because, out of all these years, I know this is the
most important trait one can find in a person &amp;mdash; a strong sense
of curiosity, an active mind, and an independent mind. The contents of
opinion don't really matter much at all &amp;larr; there are always
differences, one view vs. another, and that's the beauty of it. Even
though my line of work is aiming to &lt;strong&gt;unify&lt;/strong&gt; things into some
&lt;strong&gt;standard&lt;/strong&gt; ways of doing. Yet, probably because of that, I'm even
more sensitive and often eager to hear and to see different views, to
hear different thoughts, and to engage a debate/discussion who so, and
why not. To me, it's a checkpoint they provide to validate my thoughts
and logics, and to help a mental rehearsal so I can see how well my
conclusion stands to the test of challenge, and how really clear I can
explain them, and maybe even to convince them, if my view really
carries merits &amp;mdash; it's always good that mine gets shot down by a
deeper analysis and a deeper thinking, because that, like someone's
awesome POC, shows me another possibility I have yet to come up with,
and I think as long as someone has figured it out, I shall be able to,
and take it even further, with my mind.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The entire Huawei story in recent news are, in my view, nothing but a
fiasco. The Chinese media again sound the drum of national interest
and bully of the western powers, and this is nothing short of being a
war, if only without exchanging bullets, but plenty
greeting-to-your-mom flying across. I don't know what Huawei has as so
called backups. A story says its OS is based on an opensource version
of the Android, and these phone makers are not stranger to bundling
Playstore together with their own off-shoot OS because they don't come
w/ Google support natively. So this explains quite well how Huawei can
survive this shock and boost national confidence once more, especially
if it spins the story to be that "I have seen this coming years ago,
and I am so prepared that I can fight, and win, anytime." &amp;larr; how
well this fits the current national sentiments!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But you see, this is the exact danger that I will argue to watch out
for. I wish Huawei will fail the battle just like ZTE did, so it
doesn't propel this smoking curtain of China's confidence in
technology (well, technology is a big word, so let me limit myself to
things I know &amp;mdash; cloud using Openstack or container, quick
prototyping using any programming language, networking design to
separate management traffic from data traffic.. sounds pretty boring,
right? But that's exactly my point, engineering, and technology,
should be boring, because they are sooo detailed, and hard, that it's
not fun to put them together at all, because 99.99999% of the time,
they don't work as you want them to be!).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;China has seen waves of hypes that created unicorns, mass fans, elites
who BS without even knowing a thing of technology, and a blind belief
that "yes we can, because we dream". If you have ever tried to write a
line of code, or to learn a topic (think of your school days), or a
sports as hobby, you know that unless you have experienced pain,
frustration, upset, disappointment of yourself (and many others),
countless time wanting to give it up, nights and days of losing
motivation and wondering whether you made the wrong choice, staring at
a wall feeling completly clueless what this god-damn thing doesn't
work (but it worked yesterday!!), then, honestly, you know nothing
about engineering, nothing about technology, nothing about how all
these seemingly so common things &amp;mdash; chips, OS, any programming
language, or library, or any stack that runs, at all, is put together.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So really,  wishing to win a battle is easy, wishing to defeat Google
is easy, doing so is, hard, really really hard. If Huawei's agenda is
still based on an open source Android, I bet it will not only fail,
but doesn't solve the problem at all. Not only it won't work, to tink
of it, isn't it even more humiliating that you are now using an
&lt;strong&gt;unsupported&lt;/strong&gt; version of thing, like a left over, or a cutting edge
lab, that you are either becoming a guinea pig to be tried out with
the latest experiment, or always a few commits/versions behind!? How
is this going to be a good thing!?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Further, I admire that Huawei has been preparing for this moment for a
while, which, is a practical thinking. Miro always wants to replicate
a open source so we &lt;em&gt;control our own destiny&lt;/em&gt;, and I totally
agree. Same for any knowledge, I always want to learn and understand
even if the domain is not part of my job at all, because only after I
have an overall understanding of these things could I now make changes
to my design and code with well-thought-about confidence what it will
impact &amp;mdash; this, is the job of engineering, and should be, for all
of us.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I don't doubt Huawei will &lt;em&gt;fulfill&lt;/em&gt; its statement of continuing to
support its customers, because it said nothing about the level of
support and the quality of their service &amp;larr; the entire 1.4 billion
customers have been living without Google, any of the western news
channel or app, and are perfectly, happy. Thus, it's not surprising
they will continue to be that way, without Google, without app store,
without Android even. Nothing wrong about that.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What is wrong, is that they are being shut not only from
possibilities, but from knowing these possibilities! What is the
important to make a customer happy!? Options! So their customer will
not be happy, by this definition, because they will lose, options, not
gaining more.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Further, being kept from these technologies don't bring energy to
create new, more awesome ones! That is a wishful thinking, but has
never played out in history &amp;larr; aren't there plenty example in this
country's history, even very recent ones, that shutting doors will
only make us weaker, not stronger! It's like raising kids &amp;mdmash; you
can either keep him in a bubble in a bacteria free environment, or let
him get sick young and even put the same virus called immunization
into his vein, so that he can grow up healthy.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Same principle applies to technology. The only code that is good, is
the one that has been looked at by many many pairs of eyes, has been
deployed to many many use cases, and likely have a long bug list
&amp;mdash; it's a good sign! The unicorns in China that dominates that
market, but fooling the entire 1.4 billion users that they are
&lt;strong&gt;perfect&lt;/strong&gt;, is neither perfect, nor good, and stands no chance when
there is competition, and I mean competition of technology, not
$$. Yes I know, they have a lot of money. But looking at any of the
failed giants, they all had deep pocket, a lot of money, a large team
of talents, but they fail in a matter of months, because they failed
in technology race.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Huawei is fine, and can be fine. It will only start to fail, if itself
is believing the lie it is feeding the public. And for the upcoming
uproar of chips and operating systems, see my &lt;a href="https://fengxia41103.github.io/myblog/operating systems.html"&gt;other one&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;</content><category term="thoughts"></category><category term="thoughts"></category></entry><entry><title>女子图鉴</title><link href="https://fengxia41103.github.io/myblog/tujian.html" rel="alternate"></link><published>2019-05-16T22:44:00-04:00</published><updated>2019-05-16T22:44:00-04:00</updated><author><name>Feng Xia</name></author><id>tag:fengxia41103.github.io,2019-05-16:/myblog/tujian.html</id><summary type="html">&lt;figure class="col s12"&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Man, after watching the &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.co.jp/%E6%9D%B1%E4%BA%AC%E5%A5%B3%E5%AD%90%E5%9B%B3%E9%91%91%E3%82%B7%E3%83%BC%E3%82%BA%E3%83%B3%EF%BC%91/dp/B01MRVSJ77"&gt;東京女子図鑑&lt;/a&gt;, then the &lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R8BR7KllsfM"&gt;beijing
version&lt;/a&gt;, I can not stand the &lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JCkPNFwjdAk"&gt;shanghai version&lt;/a&gt; at all!!!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What is wrong with these story tellers!!? I mean, really, what is
wrong with you!? Can you, honestly, give some thoughts of what the
original Japanese one is about, and be a better story teller when
translating it to your local version!? Not only the story line is
summarized as an immature girl fresh out of college starts her humble
but ambitious life, then going through fortune and fame, and a dozen
men in between, and there is a marriage, a divorce, and back to her
home town to sigh and reflect, which, to me, is almost like
plagiarism, but the details are full of what I would call the
stereotype of women, and that's just disgusting!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On the 2nd episode of the SH version, let me start with this. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;humble college graduates, and women&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Why!? Why the fresh college green must be humble, be talked to,
mentored at, looked upon, like …&lt;/p&gt;</summary><content type="html">&lt;figure class="col s12"&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Man, after watching the &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.co.jp/%E6%9D%B1%E4%BA%AC%E5%A5%B3%E5%AD%90%E5%9B%B3%E9%91%91%E3%82%B7%E3%83%BC%E3%82%BA%E3%83%B3%EF%BC%91/dp/B01MRVSJ77"&gt;東京女子図鑑&lt;/a&gt;, then the &lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R8BR7KllsfM"&gt;beijing
version&lt;/a&gt;, I can not stand the &lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JCkPNFwjdAk"&gt;shanghai version&lt;/a&gt; at all!!!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What is wrong with these story tellers!!? I mean, really, what is

original Japanese one is about, and be a better story teller when
translating it to your local version!? Not only the story line is

&lt;p&gt;On the 2nd episode of the SH version, let me start with this. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;humble college graduates, and women&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Why!? Why the fresh college green must be humble, be talked to,
mentored at, looked upon, like something better than dirt!? Why!?
All of them are behaving &lt;strong&gt;cautiously&lt;/strong&gt; as if s/he is afraid to step
over some invisible mine. Why, why, why!? Why put up that kind of
voice as if yourself is the dust that is worth nothing? Then privately
vows to become someone who is outstanding, extraordinary!? &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is just bizarre!!! Absolutely strange. And why all these girls
must be like that? talk in a low voice, with smile while her thoughts
are cursing that person in front of her. There is no reason at
all. The workplace is assumed a hierarchy at the very beginning, and
this is not a modern display of a women's growth, but a familiar plot
of emperor's concubines fighting for a single man and his sperms!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This, is the very tragedy of Chinese biz culture I have been
criticizing about in many other blogs. Work is a place to communicate
thoughts, contribute your know-hows, not where you climb the social
ladder just to be looked at as a peer and colleague &amp;mdash; fxxk it,
if any company treat u like that. Trust me, it is not a good company
at all, and never deserves your time. Zero. So just walk away.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So back to the Japanese version, the girl was eager to get into Tokyo,
but was never lacking her own thoughts and preferences &amp;mdash; she
didn't know better how to do many things at the beginning, but she was
not playing stupid. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Actually, I would say the character is, should be, quite the
contrary. Who is to have a high dream of going to Tokyo, or Beijing or
SH &amp;mdash; the ones who have self-confidence, feeling she can do much
things, ready to be crushed, and must have been crushed in life in
some fashion already, thus thinking she can survive the unknown, and
will come out alright. Right!? The conservative type will unlikely
even take the first step of leaving at all. So for them, the show will
stop at, what, episode 1!!?? &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So this setup of them being &lt;strong&gt;bullied&lt;/strong&gt; left and right at the
beginning of their career is just illogical, and is the opposite of
what she is.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;mini skirts&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And what's wrong with these women in office dressing mini skirts!?
Even as a man who totally enjoys the scene and appreciate their long
legs and fine skins, but really, this is becoming a fantasy show!
Might as well set the plot in Mars!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I know I know, this is not a reality show, not a reality check and you
can argue that even the TV, the movie, by definition, is just another
form of fantasy that give you mental high. I get it. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But really, if they do care about their job, and I think they must do,
otherwise, they can do other things besides coming to office everyday
at all, and if they are as &lt;strong&gt;stylish&lt;/strong&gt; as the plot is trying to make
us believe, they simply should not be so careless at all! Mini skirt
in office is like a big tag on the head that I'm going to sleep up the
corporate ladder &amp;larr; you can think and behave and try all you want,
but who will broadcast her strategy while hopes to win? That's just
plain stupid.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;the mentor&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Really, the first female mentor/idol must be some cold blood super
stylish mature woman who is angry, picky, rich, and full of success
symbols. Why, why, why? &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The experience they want to display can be shown in the quality of
their idea, their document, their design or even PPT, but really,
should be the last to be linked to their own dress, the handbag, and
all that. You know why!? Because if she is sooo smart and wise and
mature, she would have cared less about all these things, not that
they don't wear them or buy them, but they know too well these are
just symbols, and they don't need these to shout to other employees,
especially lower ranks, by using them as her identity... that will be
just, too, shallow, too 101, don't you think!?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;BS hr&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;hr... what is wrong with these HR and their interviews!? No HR would
ever dare to make statement in front of interviewee with a sneering
tone!!!!! I don't care who they are and which company they represent,
if they do that, the company should have fired them long time ago,
because no company wants to be pictured an arrogant ass, certainly not
worth it by only one HR employee!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The only underline message I'm getting by this behavior is that:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;You interviewer's opinion and view of me and my company is
   meaningless. I don't care.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Look how tough I am by trashing you in some way.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Come one. This is just a display of power which is completely
unnecessary, not to mention unprofessional, and actually quite, again,
stupid.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The reality is, yes, I don't care about your opinion, you can't harm
my company, I can flunk you if I want.. but you know what, I'm not
gonna tell you these at all, but keep them to myself, and maybe vented
to my family or colleagues, but what's the point to display me as a
nasty HR in front you, a 99.9999% stranger who I will overlap in life
for, what, 1 hour!? I must be either insane, or just have a GIAAAAANT
ego.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;men, men, men&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The center of a women's universe, is still, men... that's what I get
from BJ and SH plots. Not thing they shouldn't have love and beakups
and all that.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You feel loneliness not only after your breakup. You feel fulfilled
not only when you have a love. You want to find out who you are, what
you want, why you like this but not that, why you love this but not
that, long long before you meet anyone, and long long long after you
two go separate ways. It's the self-reflection that builds you, the
memory that kills you. The agony of not being able to forget that
torment you day and night, and blocks you from ever feeling a strong
emotion &amp;mdash; anger, love, hate... but you want to know why, want to
know why not me, want to know what I did wrong to get to where I am,
what to know whether there is round 2, a reset, or a time machine.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That's such a strong urge that, honestly, if you haven't had that,
that is not love, and your man is just a mate, that fills your
fantasy, your need for a time, but is bound to be thrown away, maybe
mutually even.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;What it should have been&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Japanese one is a good one. Not because it was the first one I
watched, thus having the advantage of fresh mind, but because it
describes a women's growth, mentally, not through her men, but through
herself. I like &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/20_30_40"&gt;20,30,40&lt;/a&gt;, also because the story describes so
well the struggle that is unique, yet so common, to the women at that
age &amp;mdash; the energy at 20s, the confusion at 30s, and the flame and
cool down at 40s.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I still remember the last episode of the &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.co.jp/%E6%9D%B1%E4%BA%AC%E5%A5%B3%E5%AD%90%E5%9B%B3%E9%91%91%E3%82%B7%E3%83%BC%E3%82%BA%E3%83%B3%EF%BC%91/dp/B01MRVSJ77"&gt;JP one&lt;/a&gt;, that she sits by
the curb and met her highschool mentor who suggested her to lower her
dream for some mediocre college... the old woman was happy to see her,
and was happy for her success. She was wise, and the character started
to see how wise this woman was, even back in the highschool days.. she
wasn't shooting down her dreams, but was being what her age should be,
and see what the feeling in the end will be &amp;mdash; something lost,
something gain. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You never feel the gains compensates enough the losses. But it's 10
years passing by, you can not turn back the clock. So is life, for
everyone.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The 40 some Japanese woman watching those young girls dancing and
shouting, "courage!", turned around and said, "what do they know about
courage? If I do that and shout courage, that means something."&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So true. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;少年不识愁滋味，爱上层楼。爱上层楼，为赋新词强说愁。 而今识尽愁滋味，
欲说还休。欲说还休，却道天凉好个秋。&lt;/p&gt;</content><category term="thoughts"></category><category term="thoughts"></category></entry><entry><title>Life like a turtle</title><link href="https://fengxia41103.github.io/myblog/life%20like%20a%20turtle.html" rel="alternate"></link><published>2019-05-15T10:54:00-04:00</published><updated>2019-05-15T10:54:00-04:00</updated><author><name>Feng Xia</name></author><id>tag:fengxia41103.github.io,2019-05-15:/myblog/life like a turtle.html</id><summary type="html">&lt;figure class="col s12"&gt;

&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Walking back from gym a moment ago, passing the 奈何桥 I was always
joking about with her back then. Nice, cool late Spring day, beautiful
weather, beautiful sunshine, beautiful sky, almost beautiful day. Out
of the glittering sun reflection off the pond, there was this lazy
dark patch floating over there &amp;mdash; a turtle, just enjoying its
time, like I felt.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I was watching it, and immediately the thought came to me, that
probably like everyone else who, if had watched this scene, would have
thought, that if only my life is like this guy, just taking time
floating in this peaceful pond, enjoying the weather, enjoying the
life, how nice would that be!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Then, I realized that, with earphone plugged in, I was also listenning
to Mozart's Minuet in D, that is now the tune that I have played many
many times for Dad in 泰康 in his room, that I found peaceful,
relaxing, and beautiful. But then, the turtle had no such tune &amp;mdash;
however he was enjoying his time, he has …&lt;/p&gt;</summary><content type="html">&lt;figure class="col s12"&gt;

relaxing, and beautiful. But then, the turtle had no such tune &amp;mdash;
however he was enjoying his time, he has no Mozart.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So really, the &lt;strong&gt;perfect life&lt;/strong&gt; I was thinking, and probably true to
many who felt that way relating this turtle, but without realizing, is
that we want to be like the turtle, having a good time in this pond,
not rushing, but also, having Mozart by our ears, or a big ass TV
playing your favourate show, or some food to fit your appetite, or a
lover to satisfy your emotion or your body, or a good job or title to
meet your ego and monetary goal, or a car you picture yourself to race
on the road or drive by your ex- whatever, or a clothes that makes you
look like that &lt;em&gt;exact&lt;/em&gt; picture in Vogue, or a handbag (which is a
topic I have really little clue why it's good, how it is good, and
honestly I couldn't tell the difference. Period.)...&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So really, we are all after, is a combination of a lot of things, a
lot of conditions that need to be TRUE, at the same time, all be
there, all be available, all be playing out, all be present, all be
yours. This is not greed. This, is life, or be more precise, an image
of life, that you put yourself in, imagining you being the character
in that picture, in the center &amp;mdash; the center of the scene, the
center of the story line, the center of that comedy or tragedy, the
center of all the attentions, the center of the playwright, the center
of that composed, virtual, but also sooo real, universe.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;How interesting. I have always had the feeling that sometimes I felt
this entire life thing, the desire I feel, the disappointments I had,
the frustration, or happiness, are all nothing but a projection out of
my mind. Not that they are thus changeable by just switching your
mindset/prospective. Quite the contrary, they take a life sooo strong
in their own that they overwhelmed me to the point that sometime I
felt life was too hard to continue, and sometimes too beautiful to let
go &amp;rarr; thus, lost in between, start to wonder what is real, what is
truly the meaning of all these, are these really, necessary,
inevitable, or just a made up by myself, like a
self-entertainment. But then, I were the &lt;code&gt;director&lt;/code&gt; of all these,
feelings, why can't I control it, make them, different, remove the
parts I don't like, and leave the parts I do like? Wny can't I!? why
can't we!?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The turtle floated towards me slowly, as if it noticed my watching,
but decided to went back into the water and disappeared. Maybe it has
his tune of Mozart, maybe it doesn't really care about Mozart at all,
like I don't care a bit of that fish he finds it hot, or that piece of
mud hole he calls home. Maybe, he is not that enjoying the day at all,
but like some colleagues smokeing in the smoke area, just taking a
smoke break, or a coffee break, so the turtle is taking its &lt;strong&gt;whatever
break&lt;/strong&gt;!?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Maybe. I don't know. I would not ever know. But one thing I do know,
and I felt it, again, uncontrollable, like all the other emotions I
wish to get rid of but can't, or the ones I wish to stay but sometimes
hard to find again &amp;mdash; I miss you, wish you were here, so I could
tell you about my thoughts of this turtle, and you will nod, or
ignore, or just play your phone, or just doing nothing. But no
matter. You will be here, next to me, and that, is my dreamed life.&lt;/p&gt;</content><category term="thoughts"></category><category term="love"></category></entry><entry><title>Reflection on technology</title><link href="https://fengxia41103.github.io/myblog/reflection%20on%20technology.html" rel="alternate"></link><published>2019-05-13T13:20:00-04:00</published><updated>2019-05-13T13:20:00-04:00</updated><author><name>Feng Xia</name></author><id>tag:fengxia41103.github.io,2019-05-13:/myblog/reflection on technology.html</id><summary type="html">&lt;figure class="col s12"&gt;

so called 弯道超车 is ridiculous and outright disgusting. Period. This
implies to take a shortcut to win the race. I understand perfectly

good ones are always, I believe, always, organic &amp;mdash; meaning that
the idea comes from rich experience and deep insights, not some
outsider dreams of a new way overnight. My favourate these days is the
news of &lt;code&gt;vpnhub&lt;/code&gt; owned by &lt;code&gt;pornhub&lt;/code&gt; &amp;larr; what a wonderful genius
idea!!!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Technology is good, is wonderful, and is hard. I have stated in &lt;a href="https://fengxia41103.github.io/myblog/what does it bring.html"&gt;what
does IT system bring&lt;/a&gt; that there are three, and only three benefits
a technology is going to, and should, produce &amp;mdash; information
transparency, efficiency, and accountability. The article made a very
good point that:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The word “innovation” has become synonymous with Silicon Valley to
the point of absurdity. Indeed, the tech industry's entrepreneurs
and "thoughtfluencers" throw it around as casually as a dodgeball in
a middle-school P.E. class; what it really means is perpetually
unclear and purposefully hazy. It is vague enough to be suitable in
nearly any situation where a new product, service or "thing" is
advertised as superior to the old — never mind if the so-called
"old" thing has some distinct advantages, or if the new thing's
superiority is solely that it makes more money than the old thing,
or if there are other old things that are actually superior yet
which won't make anyone rich. (Consider Apple removing the headphone
jack from its new phones to be Exhibit A.)
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Like other buzz words, the word &lt;code&gt;technology&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code&gt;innovation&lt;/code&gt;, are
becoming a cliche, and are being used freely without clarification nor
accountability. Technical solution, especially in the sense of
everybody's life, is becoming the &lt;strong&gt;new middle man&lt;/strong&gt; that take a share
of the transaction, but downplaying any human element left.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The thing is, baristas and cashiers aren't things that we are all
dying to get rid of; this isn't a comparable situation to the
horse-and-buggy days, where cars felt like a serious improvement on
using beasts of burden for transit. Silicon Valley is only trying to
put baristas and cashiers out of business because human labor costs
money; the difference between a $4 coffee from a robot and a $4
coffee from a human is that there are no labor costs in the former
purchase, something that makes Silicon Valley go googly-eyed with
dollar signs. The tech industry's vision of the future is of a world
with less human interaction, less conversation, less humanity; and
more surveillance and more monetization of our buying habits. No one
wants this, but it's being forced upon us.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It is very concerning that everyone is hailing for &lt;a href="https://fengxia41103.github.io/myblog/social media.html"&gt;Facebook's&lt;/a&gt;
downturn, or even its success, because what I'm witnessing the impact
on social interaction is darn disturbing &amp;mdash; I can not, and refuse
to budge, that two young couple sitting at a breakfast in Shanghai
will each read their smartphone, but not talking, not holding hands,
not making eye contact, and not being social! This, is &lt;strong&gt;ridiculous&lt;/strong&gt;!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The only argument to defend this is always convenience. But then,
convenience isn't the crown jewel of humanity, isn't the goal of life,
isn't even necessarily a good thing. I like convenience, but it will
never dictate my choice of life, because, after all, there is still,
responsibility, duty, integrity.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Do something truly smart, is good, admirable. But in too many
occisions, I only saw pretended smartness, which, I have a word,
&lt;strong&gt;pretentious&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;</content><category term="thoughts"></category><category term="thoughts"></category></entry><entry><title>Mars</title><link href="https://fengxia41103.github.io/myblog/mars.html" rel="alternate"></link><published>2019-05-12T21:46:00-04:00</published><updated>2019-05-12T21:46:00-04:00</updated><author><name>Feng Xia</name></author><id>tag:fengxia41103.github.io,2019-05-12:/myblog/mars.html</id><summary type="html">&lt;video width="100%" height="100%" controls="controls"&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Noah and I had a curious conversation. While pulling off the highway
towards the Reader's Corner, I asked him to look over the powerball
sign to see how much it is now &amp;mdash; 250 millions. That's a lot of
money. So I teased him again about my condo in Tokyo (or really,
anywhere will be just fine), and said that if he owns the Japan
Airline, as he is thinking, then he must be having more money than
this powerball even.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So we started to talk about moving to Mars, that once the Earth
becomes too crowded, maybe he should get me a condo on Mars, or the
"other side of the Moon", as he put it. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But then, it suddenly occurred to me &amp;mdash; when we talk about
migration to Mars, there is always an implication that you must be
super rich in order to be the first few that can enjoy such
privilege. Isn't it …&lt;/p&gt;</summary><content type="html">&lt;video width="100%" height="100%" controls="controls"&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But then, it suddenly occurred to me &amp;mdash; when we talk about
migration to Mars, there is always an implication that you must be
super rich in order to be the first few that can enjoy such
privilege. Isn't it so when we hear on the news that who and who
reserved a seat going to Mars, and this person is always the super
successful tycoon and we all think that "of course! For him/her, that
ticket is just a pocket change." Though to us, that's always a lot of
money. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;However, here is a flaw in this logic. If we look at history, who went
to those remote, distant place away from home? who went to the newly
discovered the new world? Australia, criminals, unwanted; the America,
religiously suppressed group; 新疆, Tibet, the West, even
Canada, what pops to your mind is not a pleasure trip and glamorous
life, but a super high risk, though mixed with excitements and
possibilities, but certainly no one expects to find a pleasant,
comfortable life that will beat what you get at home!! &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So if we listen to these historical examples, one must then relate
that when Mars is finally settled by human, the first couple batches
will be in a barren place and likely just die, out of thirst,
starvation, or God knows what. What we are thinking of going to Mars
as those riches are going, is basing on an assumption that &lt;strong&gt;once we
can settle on it, the technology is so advanced that the land zone
will be not only super comfy, but so much cooler than anything you
will find on Earth&lt;/strong&gt; &amp;larr; what we are hoping is that the place is
the summit of the entire human race, it is constructed with the best
know-how the entire world can pull together, thus must be the ultimate
to experience.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Well, it's ultimate experience alright. But because we will be so new
to the environment, to this new world, even the best of we get may be
insufficient to deal with the challenges, or be the entire opposite
strategy that will work, or somewhere in between. Never try, never
know. But being onboard as pioneer is not what we associate with a
rich's life style. More likely, it's like visiting Japan, or China, or
India, by the missionaries by ships back in the 18th century &amp;mdash;
it's exotic, but is a pretty terrible assignment for those who went.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So, if we won the powerball, I'll stick to my wish of a condo in
Tokyo, or Cambodia, or Singapore. Mars, or the Moon, or anywhere there
isn't much human yet, thank you, but no.&lt;/p&gt;</content><category term="thoughts"></category><category term="thoughts"></category></entry><entry><title>Globalization</title><link href="https://fengxia41103.github.io/myblog/globalization.html" rel="alternate"></link><published>2019-05-09T09:11:00-04:00</published><updated>2019-05-09T09:11:00-04:00</updated><author><name>Feng Xia</name></author><id>tag:fengxia41103.github.io,2019-05-09:/myblog/globalization.html</id><summary type="html">&lt;figure class="col l6 m6 s12"&gt;
  &lt;img src="images/defragment.jpg"/&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I have been thinking about the word "globalization" in the last couple
days. I used to use it a lot during my MBA days as if it's a magic
word that fits into any topic, any slides, and made it look instantly
a good one, thus bringing me good score. It was iterated but without
me ever giving it much thought of what it actually means.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What does it mean?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There have been numerous discussions on how China is concerned about
national security when CPU and operating system are not home
made, which I have elaborated in &lt;a href="https://fengxia41103.github.io/myblog/operating systems.html"&gt;another article&lt;/a&gt; that such
feeling is completly off the mark. But this does bring me another
thought, that whether it is even possible, or advisable, for the world
to strive for max efficiency? and if so, what does it mean?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Globalization is always dressed to be an equal of international
collaboration. Examples are always that how components of any product
you can see and live with are now made in so many different countries
here and there, and …&lt;/p&gt;</summary><content type="html">&lt;figure class="col l6 m6 s12"&gt;

to strive for max efficiency? and if so, what does it mean?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Globalization is always dressed to be an equal of international
collaboration. Examples are always that how components of any product
you can see and live with are now made in so many different countries
here and there, and it is the supply chain, cheap ocean fare, and
cheap labor of billion Chinese made them possible. Thus, the
discussion leads to two threads, always:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;When dwindling Chinese cheap labor, who else is going to make them?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;With so many stuff crossing border to make them happen, zero tariff
   is a must.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And the underline message is always, that globalization is to make
each country do what they are good at, so that the world's efficiency
is improved, thus benefitting everyone. Look at how the billion
Chinese are lifted out of poverty!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But, here is a spin. There are plenty arguments around how some
countries refuse to open up their certain sectors and that's hindering
development, for them, and for others, too. What if we all open our
markets, at the same time? &amp;rarr; it's a wonderful world, isn't it!?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;No. Actually, I would strongly argue here that, there is a fundamental
problem of this idea, and about globalization in general, and its
underline message in particular.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If we go by this logic, then each country (or a group of people, or an
individual) should go by doing what they are good at, but let others
do what they are good at. Well. If American are good at army and
fighting, shouldn't we abolish our defense entirely and let them do
the job? You see, this is the same logic that mafia uses, or
colonization does! and this will never work! Not that this is not a
good formula, actually it is, from efficiency's point of view, but it
will not work because of the way human are organized into so called
country, and countries are different, just like individuals are, and
yet, we have a preset condition that everyone is born equal, and every
country "deserves" development and comfortable life and national
security and ...... the laundry list goes quite long, as you can see.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Therefore, if a place is good for tourist, we (anyone else besides
that place itself) all wish that they do what they do &amp;mdash; tourism,
and let us handle everything else, such as making cars, drinks, foods,
and sell to you! How wonderful! But there are many logic problems:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;I'm good at this A today. But should I be locked into A forever!?
   Doesn't developing tourism propelling me to be better at tourism,
   but have no chance to practice to find out my other talents!?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Doesn't this actually this tourism a single point of failure, that
   I'm so dependent on it, that if one year it didn't play out, I'm
   dead!?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;If I'm using money to buy from you, doesn't it put me at risk that
   you can just take away all my profits by lifting prices, and I have
   no leverage? Isn't this how farming tenants were robbed by their
   landlords for centuries?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;There are something I can't just buy off the shelf, aren't there!?
   We already said about national defense. We can't outsource police
   either, nor government in general (yeah, US is very good at
   management, let them manage our government then), and food (doesn't
   importing food, or oil, already create so much friction that it is
   causing war and many other problems!?)....&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Essentially this logic will derive to the conclusion that a place
should be locked into a certain status, like a person should be locked
into a social ladder, forever and ever. This apparently will not play
well with anyone, or with any country. Nobody wishes to be that way.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So here comes the savior &amp;mdash; a new term, a new label, a new word,
but really, the same old colonization concept &amp;mdash; one road one
belt, open market, and globalization. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It's a great idea for earth as a whole. But I don't think earthlings
will ever embrace it in their existence before, well, earth is gone.&lt;/p&gt;</content><category term="thoughts"></category><category term="thoughts"></category></entry><entry><title>Emotion</title><link href="https://fengxia41103.github.io/myblog/emotion.html" rel="alternate"></link><published>2019-05-02T09:13:00-04:00</published><updated>2019-05-02T09:13:00-04:00</updated><author><name>Feng Xia</name></author><id>tag:fengxia41103.github.io,2019-05-02:/myblog/emotion.html</id><summary type="html">&lt;figure class="col l7 m7 s12"&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I have been listening to this midnight talk show by this &lt;a href="https://www.weibo.com/u/1846267753"&gt;woman/girl&lt;/a&gt;
for the last few weeks on and off, and found it quite fascinating, not
that it's sentimental and discussing the eternal topic of love that is
guaranteed to acquire attention and discussion and audience. I found
it interesting because there are so many of this type of programs out
there, and they all sound the same &amp;mdash; same opening line, same
background music, same speed of speech, and sometimes I even feel they
have the same text(!)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But what's the most fascinating thing is, this woman's opening line, "
嘿，睡了吗?"... first time hearing it, I felt a tiny bit strange,
though it feels pretty typical for program like this, reminds me the
相伴到黎明, a program I liked in college days. But, it daunted on me
what's so strange about this line while doing dinner last night.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This seems to be a question of Yes or No. &lt;strong&gt;But, it can only have one
answer!&lt;/strong&gt; &amp;mdash; if you are asleep …&lt;/p&gt;</summary><content type="html">&lt;figure class="col l7 m7 s12"&gt;

answer!&lt;/strong&gt; &amp;mdash; if you are asleep, you won't hear it! thus, will not
respond! Only the one who is still awake, will be able to answer, if
at all!!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You know, this can be argued as another example of oxymoron, like that
"life after death". This makes me really wonder just how bizzare and
being the root cause of all misfortune that human language really is
&amp;mdash; I have a strong feeling that language, is like arts, like the
building in Kenneth Clark's Civilization, is the &lt;strong&gt;exact&lt;/strong&gt; reflection
of that era, that society, that group of people, the mindset, the
logic, the emotion, and the outcomes that we are now calling
them,history.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Just by the front entrance of build 7 today, Scott was speaking to his
colleague, a black woman, whom I have seen but never spoke to, and
they walked to a different direction when Scoot and I greeted each
other. The woman was in tears.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I don't know what is happening. But seeing someone, even a stranger,
in tears, makes me sad, makes the heart skip a beat, and makes me want
to reach out, sit down with that person, offer him or her something,
something comforting, something warm, something to calm down,
something to assure that everything, will be alright.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yesterday while walking back from gym, I saw the cleaning girl
standing by the building, just standing there. I was wondering,
doesn't she, like me, like everything else I'm sure, that has a love
in life, a love she had but not being together anymore, a love she
memorizes sometimes, at night, and feeling a pain still inside? I'm
sure everyone has. But then, why am I so tangled with the memories I
have? the love I had? the person I missed? This is such a universal
situation, such a common and general scenario, such a sure thing, then
why, do we still struggle with it? have no solution to it? have no
resolution to it? and have no way out of it once you are, in?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This, is truly a mystery, a sad, mystery.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Human emotion啊, when can we know what it really is? can we ever come
out of the love agony? can we ever master one's memory &amp;mdash; didn't
I create it at the first place!? then why, it takes on its own life
after creation, comes and goes at its own will, and runs wild, from
one extreme to another, making me like a boat caught in a storm in the
sea, up and down, up, and down, up, and down.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Searching for "how many emotions are there" didn't give me an answer
at all. Somewhere says there are four basic ones, and there are 42
muscles to compose them. I guess there isn't really a sure agreement
yet.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But it's there, so dominant, so central, so long lasting, so defining,
so real, that, one can only cope with, when it hits, and wish to come
out, alive. Honestly, sometimes, I wish, I will never come out,
because missing someone again, for one day, is worse than being alive.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Actually, that's an easy defense to brush it off. What I'm really
frustrated is the terrible mistake the team has made by not keeping up
their own work and let the updates slip, so that the reviewer was
working on the wrong version, thus missed all these fixes and likely
was misled to such perception &amp;mdash; how stupid!! and how incredibly
irresponsible!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Time and again, I have witnessed the China team fail to grasp the idea
of &lt;a href="https://fengxia41103.github.io/myblog/what is engineering.html"&gt;engineering&lt;/a&gt;, that requires precision, deep thinking, lots of
hard works to make pieces match, correct, accurate, and hopefully
still elegant and easy to use, but by bluntly throw paperworks over
the wall without ever looking, without ever even trying to understand
the contents, without giving thoughts of how to make coordination
better, easier, for next time at least, but falling into the same
failure pattern, over and over and over.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I truly believe now that engineering, management, are actually the
same thing, because they require the same principle to be good &amp;larr;
essentially, whatever the virtue to make a good human being, is what
would make a good engineer, or a manager, or a good husband, or a good
wife.... it is really the same thing. Well, by putting in this way,
unfortunately it can be derived that the percentage of such population
is, quite low. The majority of the team, the company, the people you
meet or know in life, will be guaranteed disappointing. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I'm actually amazed how a bad judgment can be so common, even among
supposedly smart people. I really don't get it. One thing I know for
sure is that so called education doesn't change this at all &amp;mdash;
yes you can say it's the fault of a failed education, and degree
certainly doesn't translate to good judgment. Yet, what's the
alternative? what can a person have a good judgment? And when I say
the word judgment, I don't mean like judgment day that will look over
everything you did, and will make a call that is "surely correct"
&amp;mdash; what I mean is simply the subjective decision, the 判断 of a
situation, imagine steps and where they can lead, and out of ambiguity
to pick a path that turns out, by the person's historical track
record, to be mostly good decisions, when looking back.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This sounds easy, right? Isn't everyone already doing it? But there
are paths that are so obviously wrong, that by just taking a couple
steps in your mind, you will see all kinds of questions you don't know
how to answer, and feel that this may not be a good idea. Yet, so many
times, so many times, people take it as if they were blind! The truth
is, I believe, that they don't have the capability to imagine that two
steps and their potential consequences. Period. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The lack of imagination, kills it. This is the exact trait of a young
kid, you know!? and we can generally agree that kids in young age can
not be &lt;em&gt;trusted&lt;/em&gt; for their decision, because they are so short-term
oriented, and so, detail-oriented. Over the weekend I had this
conversation w/ Noah about something. I was using "a couple" as a
description to make a point, and he corrected me immediately that "it
was [a number]"... he totally didn't get what I was trying to make
across, but firmly held on to be sure that the quoted number is
&lt;strong&gt;correct&lt;/strong&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Kids, one can argue, is too young to have abstract thinking, being
able to derive and to generalize. And here I am, dealing with a
similar crowd who has no imagination, poor decisions, and genuinely
not made for this line of work.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I don't know. I'm tired. I'm the one who is going to be laughed at, I
know. But I do think, even when the entire island thinks I'm insane, I
still believe that it's the island that is not right, not me. Not
because that I'm confident or even arrogant. No. It's the result that
tells me so &amp;mdash; when we go by their thoughts, bad things happen;
when we go by my ways, good things happen.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Well, now we have to justify by whose standard it is good or bad.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Forget it. Let me just get over this fiasco. I'll never get myself
into this mess again.&lt;/p&gt;</content><category term="thoughts"></category><category term="thoughts"></category></entry><entry><title>History, choice</title><link href="https://fengxia41103.github.io/myblog/history%20choice.html" rel="alternate"></link><published>2019-04-17T11:04:00-04:00</published><updated>2019-04-17T11:04:00-04:00</updated><author><name>Feng Xia</name></author><id>tag:fengxia41103.github.io,2019-04-17:/myblog/history choice.html</id><summary type="html">&lt;figure class="col l6 m6 s12"&gt;

&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is a tough one, actually, because the topic is really deep. In
this aftermath of the Nortre Dame fire, the idea of restoring the
damage immediately comes to everybody's mind.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Inevitably, however, there are always, two choices &amp;mdash; to rebuild
it as it was, or to build it as we want them, today? Obviously by
posing them in front of you, you see the merits in both
directions. Yet, as a historical trademark, the lean towards the
former is much stronger than the latter. But this exactly raises a
question that I want to talk about &amp;mdash; history.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I have been reading quite some history books, and in recent days start
to read books written by historian on history. It is really
fascinating, because I have never realized the word history is not as
clear as it seems, at all! We have been taking for granted that
history = old, = the past. But to think about it, if the event has
already past, are we just reconstructing it today? After all, the
writer was not necessarily a …&lt;/p&gt;</summary><content type="html">&lt;figure class="col l6 m6 s12"&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I have been reading quite some history books, and in recent days start

fascinating, because I have never realized the word history is not as
clear as it seems, at all! We have been taking for granted that
history = old, = the past. But to think about it, if the event has
already past, are we just reconstructing it today? After all, the
writer was not necessarily a witness, a participant, or even born back
then. Thus the whole idea of reconstruction is really a matter of a
personal choice of materials and perception of how the event was
unfolded, wasn't it!? If you walk in any book store and look at the
"history" section, there are always books that describe the huge
impact of a small, ordinary thing, that has changed the fate of
mankind &amp;mdash; chicken, sugar, rice, anything goes. If you think of
it, it is hardly arguable that any in your life, as of today, is
unimportant &amp;mdash; really, name one thing in your life that you can
go without, I mean, go without for the rest of your life.. well,
abstract such as pain, suffering, poverty don't count. I mean,
physical, things.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So, this brings us back to the discussion that what to build for the
Nortre Dame. First of all, can we really reconstruct as it were!?
Hardly, or should we just say, impossible. For one, materials are
different now from 800 years ago, so are the engineering. Therefore,
the replica can be as truthful as all the blueprints are saying. Yet,
it is different. It looks the same, but it is different, better,
actually.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Second, why should we? We admire its beauty because it reflected what
was then. Exactly because such beauty has sustained time for so long,
that we make it a close thing to eternity. But, if we fast forward 800
more years, wouldn't people want to see what represents, today, that
we are currently living and breathing everyday, instead of an
interpretation version of something we could only speculate? In other
words, shouldn't the responsibility of architecture to be the document
of that time, instead of some other time!? You can take any iconic
construction, and see this logic applies &amp;mdash; Ankor Wat, the
Forbidden Palace, the Empire State building... each is a symbol of its
time. It would be rather strange if the Ankor Wat was really built as
a replica of another temple 800 years before it. I mean, it would be
cool and alright. But, wouldn't we then lose the document of its own
time? &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This makes me start to believe that each generation indeed bears the
responsibility to be truthful to themselves &amp;mdash; if they were ugly
people, so be it, generate some ugly arts, as long as they did come
from their heart and soul.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I have been a critics of all the ugly Chinese modern buildings back
then. Now writing this, I start to reflect on this point. I was
biased. They, actually did their part in history. Though I don't like
the result, but nonetheless, I'm not to be the judge. Nor even time
could be the judge. But only the eyes of the some other generation
down the line will fit to look at the era and say, "Look, this is the
icon of that century (that dynasty, that time, or that generation)",
and there will be no right or wrong, good or bad, but representative
vs. one-of-kind outlier.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This reminds the openining of Kenneth Clark's documentary,
&lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w6qYjisp51M"&gt;Civilization&lt;/a&gt;, that if
to choose what can truthfully represent the time, it will be arts
&amp;mdash; not writing of any kind, but arts &amp;mdash; buildings,
paintings, music....even the &lt;em&gt;bad&lt;/em&gt; ones, or shouldn't we say,
especially the bad ones!? In general, they are more true than others,
they always carry a strong emotion, have a strong message, always
always being the cutting edge of what people felt at that time.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So leave the taste out, they are the perfect ear marks. I don't love
them in many cases; but they are wonderful, as history.&lt;/p&gt;</content><category term="thoughts"></category><category term="thoughts"></category></entry><entry><title>Music</title><link href="https://fengxia41103.github.io/myblog/music.html" rel="alternate"></link><published>2019-04-15T15:41:00-04:00</published><updated>2019-04-15T15:41:00-04:00</updated><author><name>Feng Xia</name></author><id>tag:fengxia41103.github.io,2019-04-15:/myblog/music.html</id><summary type="html">&lt;figure class="col s12"&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There is magic in music. There is.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I'm listening to this song, a song I have never heard of, and the
singer I have never heard of. Yet, it makes me so sad, so sad. It's
not the words, not the performance, not the story in a MTV, it's just
the, notes, the music.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What is it in music, that I can always feel so touched!? so
connected!? This is the song she introduced me to. I have never heard
of this till that day, and what a surprise to me. I should have known.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;No words can describe a music. It is, choking, when a song touches
your soul. I think the moment of 2006 when Lei passed away is as fresh
as that day. There was a line in the song that 我们最好的朋友昨天晚上
走了 ... this, is like yanking me out of space, out of time, back to
the day he left. How strange, I was just thinking of him this morning,
wondering …&lt;/p&gt;</summary><content type="html">&lt;figure class="col s12"&gt;

the day he left. How strange, I was just thinking of him this morning,
wondering, for the millionth time, there were anything I could have
done, to have changed all these.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I don't know. Life is hard. Getting old is hard. Being old will be
even harder. I'm afraid. I don't want to, I don't feel I have the
strength to pull it through to the end, wherever the end might
be. Many many times I have dreamed of a diagnosis of some kind of
terminal ill that I then know my end is coming, is near. It's actually
comforting to know it's going to, end.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I admire those people who keep to be optimistic, to be hopeful, to
look forward to a change, to a dream. I don't have those anymore. When
did I change? I don't know. Could I have been different? what am I? I
thought I have been true to myself. But if this is the true of me,
then the path has indeed been designed to be a tough one.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I should really be grateful, for I have owned so much, got so much,
been given so much. Human is insatiable, I guess, so am I. It's not
greed, well, it is, a form of greed, greed of love, greed of
affection, greed of understanding. It is, so like everyone else, like
the eternal truth, that greed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So. If you feel you lost your way, lost the memory, lost the voice to
speak to yourself, listen, listen, it passes your heart, squeeze so
hard, that you will bleed, will feel pain, will then, remember.&lt;/p&gt;</content><category term="thoughts"></category><category term="thoughts"></category></entry><entry><title>Frustration</title><link href="https://fengxia41103.github.io/myblog/frustration.html" rel="alternate"></link><published>2019-04-12T11:20:00-04:00</published><updated>2019-04-12T11:20:00-04:00</updated><author><name>Feng Xia</name></author><id>tag:fengxia41103.github.io,2019-04-12:/myblog/frustration.html</id><summary type="html">&lt;figure class="col l7 m7 s12"&gt;

&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Yes, I'm very much frustrated, last night in particular, that I'm
getting fed up by the bullshift question seeking for decision, while
at the meantime the other party gives little information, and has
pretty much made up mind already of what they wanted to do &amp;mdash; so
hell, why do u ask me for!? Do you want to hear my opinion, or just
want a debate!?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The bottom of all these is a fundamental gap I have been perceiving
all long in many settings, not just work, but in life in general, that
many many many many people (yes, definitely too many) who lack the
sheer capability take a thought one step further in their mind and put
in more consideration by asking themselves what it could be like if I
do this, or not to do this? You would think this is the natural way
everybody thinks, that's how mind works, isn't it, by weighing
options? &lt;/p&gt;

everybody thinks, that's how mind works, isn't it, by weighing
options? &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But you will be surprised. I know I am. All the time I start to
question whether I'm the odd ball on the island occupied by a tribe of
insane, or of course, in their eyes I'm the insane one! Really, tell
me, haven't you had such moment? I bet there is. This is super crazy,
really. We are creating work for ourselves now, by making what I call
&lt;strong&gt;shallow decisions&lt;/strong&gt; that patches up things in, &lt;strong&gt;always&lt;/strong&gt;, an
emergency mode, while everybody runs around super busy, but the end
result is nothing but a patched up work. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Then, the worst. Everybody starts to pad each others' back,
congratulate a job well done, yet another success, and move on,
literally, without ever sitting down and review what went wrong, why
they went wrong, anything we should learn and watch out for next
time. Amazing, truly amazing! I'm impressed by such easy feeling of
comfort, and start afresh everytime without feeling anything is
wrong. Now writing these, I feel they are like Dory, who always sees
the world a new one, every 7 seconds. How wonderful that will be!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But, this is not engineering! This is not professional! and this is
not even maturity! I'm not going into an even more disturbing
conclusion that this is simply, purely, stupid! I'm having serious
trouble to understand their mentality to brush off a problem without
feeling &lt;strong&gt;what the heck&lt;/strong&gt;, and have no curiosity to fix it. Then, tell
me, what is going to be the next!? Well, I have an answer for you, the
same fire drill in another 2 weeks, or 2 months, and we will trip at
the same place, in the same pothole, and eventually, I guarantee you,
the luck will run out, and shit will flow, and who is going to clean
that up!?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is absolutely ridiculous. So, enough complaints, let's talk about
what went wrong, in my opinion:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;seeking decision without giving details&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Everytime I see some one-liner email like this, "so and so is broken,
can we fix it", or "should we do so and so", my blood pressure
shoots off the roof &amp;mdash; these are completely irresponsible, waste
of time, solves nothing, email, that the only message I'm getting is,
"go do it, and it is all your responsibility, and I have none."&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Do you see it? How am I going to take any action, or give any opinion
without having information &amp;mdash; if so and so is broken, a list of
questions pop into my mind:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;What is the symptom? &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;What did you do?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;What are you trying to do?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;How did you come to the conclusion that it was broken? What was the
   reference of "not broken"?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;What have you already tried?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;What is your analysis of what might be the cause?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;How could we zoom in or eliminate/prove the cause?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;What is your suggestion? and preference?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The bottom line is, help me to understand the situation, give me
information, so I could be informed and make a suggestion based on my
domain expertise. Just a question that "can we fix it" means nothing
to me &amp;mdash; you know what, this is a YES or NO question, so there
are really two possible answers by definition. What if my default
answer is, NO!? then what? do you have any better idea? If you do,
then why not say them at the first place? and if you don't (and that's
why you are asking me, right!?), then you have my answer, and go away.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Happy?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;seeking decision but decision has been made&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Too many times question is posted to me as if it's seeking my
opinion. However, as soon as the opinion is out, man, there come all
kinds of relevant (but really &lt;strong&gt;irrelevant&lt;/strong&gt;) argument to essentially
shoot it down because my answer is not what they want to hear &amp;mdash;
dead line, schedule, promise to customer, promise to manager, promise
to so and so &amp;mdash; I always wanted to just shuffle all these into
their face, "these are all your problems, not mine!" I didn't make
those promise, I didn't make those deadline, I'm hired to produce
quality, not time.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yes, time. If you know anybody who can create time, I would love to
talk to him/her, cause, really, time, I wish I could, create new,
produce more, and go back (or even go forward, like a quick forward to
death, if it is an option).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;All this type of BS leads to is just argument, and argument doesn't
even add information, because each side has been pre-set to take a
position, so just trying to hold position and convince the other party
&amp;mdash; this is not engineering discussion, this is a political debate
for president, only one side is going to win, and one party to rule.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This, is all, wrong.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;last words&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the end, I think what is missing is the fundamental intellectual
capability to perceive a path by doing it in mind, and by believing
that your information is never perfect, thus listenning is a way of
checking whether there is anything important thing you missed in
others' arguments. Only when you think your points have covered the
other's ground, should you be firm w/ your opinion and defend it
&amp;mdash; this, to me, is the definition of open-mindness. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But sadly, I have only met less than a handful in my entire life who
possesses this trait, naturally. The rest majority, and I'm sure this
is representative of proportion of population who will have the (so
now we are talking about, I don't know, 0.0001%? some minute number
for sure).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;First time I heard from 高晓松 that the crowd (or the people) is
actually the thing we should be alert for (警惕), I thought it was
rather counter intuitive. However, the older I get, the more I start
to realize, the majority, is not wise. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The majority, creates mess, but they are perfectly content. It's the
minority, who can't live w/ such mess, will end up cleaning them up.&lt;/p&gt;</content><category term="thoughts"></category><category term="thoughts"></category></entry><entry><title>Stay connected</title><link href="https://fengxia41103.github.io/myblog/stay%20connected.html" rel="alternate"></link><published>2019-04-06T14:11:00-04:00</published><updated>2019-04-06T14:11:00-04:00</updated><author><name>Feng Xia</name></author><id>tag:fengxia41103.github.io,2019-04-06:/myblog/stay connected.html</id><summary type="html">&lt;figure class="col s12"&gt;

&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It is indeed quite a long time, 21 years. A friend of mine reminded me
that, this year has been the 21st year since we knew each other. This
is also the age of the internet chat I would say, because we met each
other online, as an early adopter of these chat applications, ICQ,
which was the mother of all chat applications including the copycat,
the Chinese QQ, and of course, now its sequel, the enormous Wechat. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I don't know how our relationship survived the 21 years, during which
many years we had zero contact, zero news of each other. Then when we
started to talk to each other again last December, that I learned she
was then staying in a village somewhere in the west of China doing
some sort of volunteering work, we didn't feel too strange at all.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But this isn't giving me a formula how to maintain the other
relationships in life to be as long-living as this one. You can easily
say that it takes two in a personal …&lt;/p&gt;</summary><content type="html">&lt;figure class="col s12"&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But this isn't giving me a formula how to maintain the other
relationships in life to be as long-living as this one. You can easily
say that it takes two in a personal relationship, thus this case
worked because both of us did not have a grudge against each other,
and was quite neutral to either having it or not having it &amp;rarr; no
pressure, no expectation, thus no regret.  Then, for many others, such
condition does not exist, which make them improbably to continue or to
resume.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;True, true. But also, I feel there is a fate, an element of
uncontrollable destiny in play, that two trajectories happen to be far
apart, but crossing still. Since last march I have been thinking why
my marriage w/ Noah's mom would end up like this? what was the
difference, or how it could have been different? On my part I had much
hope, much expectation, much judgement, and much less tolerance. But
how can two be together not having these traits? Is the connection of
me and this friend that is more like a two drifting rocks in space
living happily with or without the other is the way to last? Can it
even be called a connection, because most part of the time we were
really not, connected!?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To think of it, the number might be impressive, but the density was,
little. We could still claim that we know each other, but the reality
is, I don't know much of her, her life, her circle, her agenda, her
passion, anything, really. So there isn't really much there. But w/
Noah's mom, I still face everything accompanied w/ Noah's life &amp;mdash;
drop off at school, not doing or turning in homework, arrangement for
a non-school day, spring break, summer break, need medication,
shuttling to badminton, breakfast at Panera, grocery shopping, so on
and so forth. Not that these are joyful and exciting. On the contrary,
the only word I can think of is, grinding. But they are, heavy, solid,
like a rock lying in the middle of the road, you can't go around it,
you can't run over it, you can't ignore it, you can't pick another
road, you can't have option not to deal with it &amp;rarr; you have to get
up, get down, use all your energy, tools, and sometimes even more than
what you know, to remove it, clear the path, so you can make pass one
single day &amp;mdash; they are too real, too mercilessly confronting, and
always they win.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So there you have it, one that ties you down to the ground, you feel
you have wings but you can never fly w/ that weight. And these
long-time acquaintance, friend, ex this and ex that, reminds you how
long it has been, how long you have survived, and checking whether
there is any soul left in it, that's still beeping, still breathing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I have always had a feeling, that the end of my life will be like the
author of the 红楼梦, or that movie, 芳华, that another woman I have

&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I'm scared. I had an uneasy sleep last night, worrying about a lot of
things. In particular, I worried about time, about myself getting
old. At age 46, it seems absurd that I'm feeling old. Yet, that's how
I'm feeling these days, and it is not going away.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I have long realized that ten years is a long time, a long time that
many many things will happen. Actually it is such a long time that it
changes a person, almost completely &amp;larr; looking back myself ten
years ago, the life I had, the state I was in, the look, the body, the
spirit, the activities, the people around me, the person I cared
for... everything, has changed. How alarming! I remember telling Siqi
of this theory while sitting on a stair in Shenzhen after a day's
walking around &amp;mdash; I felt such a wise person to say that, as if I
figured out a secret of life. To her, this must sound like wisdom,
cause her whole life hasn't been counted much in ten-year marks. But …&lt;/p&gt;</summary><content type="html">&lt;figure class="col s12"&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I'm scared. I had an uneasy sleep last night, worrying about a lot of

I'm feeling these days, and it is not going away.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I have long realized that ten years is a long time, a long time that
many many things will happen. Actually it is such a long time that it
changes a person, almost completely &amp;larr; looking back myself ten
years ago, the life I had, the state I was in, the look, the body, the
spirit, the activities, the people around me, the person I cared
for... everything, has changed. How alarming! I remember telling Siqi
of this theory while sitting on a stair in Shenzhen after a day's
walking around &amp;mdash; I felt such a wise person to say that, as if I
figured out a secret of life. To her, this must sound like wisdom,
cause her whole life hasn't been counted much in ten-year marks. But
at the time I said it without realizing how brutal this also means,
and how sad it is since nothing can be done to stop time, and nothing
can be done to turn back &amp;mdash; ten years, is such a long time, such
a long time.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But then, last night I started to count how I came to be &amp;larr; if
counting my life in this step, it only takes two ten-years from
mid-20s to where I am today, not much at all really, no wonder I still
remember clearly the days of twenty years ago, still struggle with the
same type of things i struggled twenty years ago, still feel I was
like twenty years ago, though in reality, everything has changed,
everyone has gone. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Life starts at 0, but the first ten doesn't leave
much since you don't remember. Then the next ten, where Noah is in
right now, he understands some, not much at all, still childish or
child-like, immature, unthoughtful, lost touch of yourself like this
morning that he wakes up early, sitting across the table to me at
Panera doing his homework, but without know why he feels down (beats
me! he is just a moody kid, sometimes I wonder), and how he
should/could handle it, such a clueless, rough age.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Then, we are counting the third ten-year already(!), the prime of
life &amp;mdash; wonderful time, young, healthy, full of energy, full of
possibility, full of dream, hope, fantasy, full of adventure, full of
bad decisions, trials and errors, full of excitements, full of false
feeling of independence, surrounded by supports, from family, friends,
foes, people who want to please you, who want to take advantage of
you, who want to be close to you, who want to fool you, who genuinely
like or love you, who, in most cases, are also in this same period of
life, thus feeling you are all alike, and you are in sync with
everybody, and you are not alone, and you strive to be the same, and
even to stand out. You yearn for being alone, as if the crowd around
you is suffocating. But dear, it's only because you haven't tasted the
truth of loneliness &amp;mdash; you can hardly be alone at this age,
that's why you feel being alone is different, cooler, and wiser. Wait
till the loneliness comes to you, surrounds you, and drowns you. It's
not fun.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Then, the fourth ten-year, 30-40 now. Not bad, family, kid, marriage,
more adult like now, feels life could be like this, forever, busy,
perhaps, career driven, most likely, as if in reach to grab the next
fortune, to become the next world-changing person. But anxiety, really
unimportant trivia like family, wife, husband, kids, all the wonderful
things really, that start to turn color and become a source of
frustration. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Then, without knowing much, 40s, the fifth ten-year now in life. Boy,
don't I feel old now! I can hardly imagine when I'm in 50s, a common
definition that I'll then be an old guy! My Goad, how scary &amp;mdash;
too quickly, too soon. Before you can be ready (and how can anyone be
ready for this!?), it's here. No more the same body, same look, same
health, same possibility, same hopefulness. Everything seems to be
becoming to its end, slowing down, ramping down, turning off, losing
ground. You look back, quite some miles you have covered; looking
forward, quite some miles ahead. But the fun part of the journey is
over, and why should I continue on then?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So this is life, counting in ten-years, such a short short short
time. Ten years, so long that everything is changed; so short, that
you only could to the fifth to be old. Is life long, or short then!?
It's short, I would say, short for it doesn't give you a second
chance, doesn't give you back what you have lost, doesn't make you
stronger, better, just older, older so that you reason, to yourself,
you don't need that strength anymore.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But the truth is, it's not too long, nor too short. Its only fault is
that there were moments in it that you wish to stay, but can not. Like
the moment we sit at the stair talking about this ten-year marks; like
the trip to this unknown temple that even locals don't visit; like the
recording booth in the middle of this busy, loud, arcade; like the
crazily chilly weekend the cold front hit the city; like watching over
the city night from top of this little hill, feeling the breeze of an
early spring; like riding on the back seat of bus after saying
farewell to the poor little thing who passed in our caring...  if only
could be kept, could be replayed, could be relived.&lt;/p&gt;</content><category term="thoughts"></category><category term="thoughts"></category></entry><entry><title>Ordinary</title><link href="https://fengxia41103.github.io/myblog/ordinary.html" rel="alternate"></link><published>2019-03-22T10:54:00-04:00</published><updated>2019-03-22T10:54:00-04:00</updated><author><name>Feng Xia</name></author><id>tag:fengxia41103.github.io,2019-03-22:/myblog/ordinary.html</id><summary type="html">&lt;figure class="col l7 m7 s12"&gt;

&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Have you had a funny feeling on someday, that something is happening,
to someone, someone that jumps to your mind at the first thought when
you had that feeling? That's how I felt today. I don't know what it
is. If looking at this line I just wrote, I would have criticized that
this is complete pointless statement because it is always, true
&amp;mdash; yes, something is always happening, to someone, and yes there
might be one who jumps to your mind, but then, isn't it just
coincidence!? I would say so.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But, but, this is, somehow, different. It is a feeling of someone,
that, someone, that you know you care about, you worry about, you
think of, and you want to know, to find out, to hear from, to be next
to. That the thought that something is happening to him/her makes you,
uneasy. Maybe it's just being selfish, but maybe, it's just that, you
care.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I do. I care, even though it's as remote as I care about a star
traveling too fast …&lt;/p&gt;</summary><content type="html">&lt;figure class="col l7 m7 s12"&gt;

uneasy. Maybe it's just being selfish, but maybe, it's just that, you
care.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I do. I care, even though it's as remote as I care about a star
traveling too fast in space and will burn out a million years too soon
&amp;mdash; the star flies along, with or without me sitting here to worry
about it, and it burns however it feels so, with or without me having
a feeling or another. Its life will take its course, and it has
nothing to do w/ me, w/ mine.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yet, I look at this star, somewhere, there, and I can't help thinking
of it, wishing it would be alright, wishing it would be safe, sound,
happy.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Coming back from gym, a guy was walking in front of me. Nothing
special, just another ordinary mid-age guy. Suddenly I was thinking,
doesn't he also have someone on him mind, in his heart, that he hold
dear, like me holding you? Why not? Shouldn't anyone have such a
person to cherish? Wouldn't anyone have one s/he loves, loved? Why
should I be anything special? In their eyes, amn't I just another
ordinary guy walking on the street, maybe even somewhat repulsive,
self-important, and terrible to deal with? If so, wouldn't it make
that missing you is really the worst I could do, because you deserve
so much more that what I have &amp;larr; you should be with, should be
missed by, someone, extraordinary, someone far better, far smarter,
far talented, than I am.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I wish I could write these to you, and you can read it
someday. There are so much that come through my mind each day,
sometimes each moment, that I could only speak to you as if you lived
inside me, like an inner voice, that you could hear, and you could
understand. Yet, it's so unlikely that you will ever see all these,
probably wouldn't care anyway. It's ok. So to only jog down these
words that have occurred to me, while I'm walking in the sun during a
chilly Spring Friday, sitting at this (fake) Starbucks in the office
when the area is unusually quiet, caught in between the morning coffee
rush and the lunch crowd, listening to a song I have listened many
many many time, and having you on my mind, to think of, to talk to, to
feel, that something is happening in your life, that can still disturb
my soul, makes me sad, makes me uneasy, makes me wonder.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Just an ordinary day, for this world. But never an ordinary day, for
me, because you are always, special. So the star that flies by,
travel safe, burn safe, live safe. Wherever you are, I will miss you;
whatever is happening, I will be on your side.&lt;/p&gt;</content><category term="thoughts"></category><category term="love"></category></entry><entry><title>City life</title><link href="https://fengxia41103.github.io/myblog/city%20life.html" rel="alternate"></link><published>2019-03-20T21:29:00-04:00</published><updated>2019-03-20T21:29:00-04:00</updated><author><name>Feng Xia</name></author><id>tag:fengxia41103.github.io,2019-03-20:/myblog/city life.html</id><summary type="html">&lt;figure class="col s12"&gt;

&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I find it curious. Listening to a sentimental talk show on the Netease
music app, the kind that a young woman's pretty face as the icon, and
a soothing voice that suggest the picture you see is her, and slow,
relaxing, late night style light music in the background, and always
topics of thoughts, quite like what I have from time to time, about
life, about love, about career, about purpose, about why the suffering
and why the choice.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On the one hand, I feel she is too young to be really understand the
depth of these topics. I can't help having the sense that this is 为说
新词强说愁, and many of the arguments are actually, false, in my
opinion, because there is an underline assumption that she is not even
touching (or making it obvious that she is aware of such
assumption). For example, a popular sentiment is the anxiety of young
people who is living a city life &amp;mdash; so called stress from work,
from struggling, especially if struggling …&lt;/p&gt;</summary><content type="html">&lt;figure class="col s12"&gt;

新词强说愁, and many of the arguments are actually, false, in my
opinion, because there is an underline assumption that she is not even
touching (or making it obvious that she is aware of such
assumption). For example, a popular sentiment is the anxiety of young
people who is living a city life &amp;mdash; so called stress from work,
from struggling, especially if struggling alone, from unfair treatment
by the boss, by the peers, by the city culture overall. Then, the
counter side is always "but she gives up a nice easy life in her home
town and chose to come to Shanghai... because she is not ready to live
a repetitive life as her parents (and other friends).." and so on. So
here is one huge assumption that home town life will be easy and
quiet, that she can "go home at 5 and be with parents and spend the
night watching TV". Well, if we now examine this &lt;strong&gt;assumption&lt;/strong&gt;, it's
obvious this is not true, in many many ways.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;First of all, small town life is not a rosy picture, at all. Small
social circle also means closer ties, less privacy, and higher peer
pressure. You will have more extra hands to help, but also extra
voices to listen to, to show respect to, to follow a stricter social
hierachy, to meet a less flexible expectation, to deal w/ tighter
control of your each step as if the rail has been laid, for you... by
the way, nobody said that less uncertainty equals less
stress. Honestly, I simply do not buy such theory at all &amp;mdash; this
is the same as those talk show of history constantly remind us that
life in the Song dynasty was a wonderful. Give me a break! I bet even
a nobody is living a better life than the kings back then, better
health at least, better dental, better toilet... so the same goes w/
these small town fantasy. If home town life were all gain but no loss,
I would seriously consider it a world wonder, cause till today,
nothing like this has been found yet.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Second, feeling loneliness and being alone, is terrible, but is
universal, and is necessary. This is not a city disease. On the
contrary, being surrounded by friends and family is suffocating and
unhealthy. Let me ask this, how are you forming your own opinion on
things if you don't have the chance to read and hear from less
opinionated source (ok, I know all news are opinions, in a way, but
better than a complete opinion from, anyone, parent, relatives,
friends, foes, anyone), and have time to think? City is cruel, it is
distant, it does not care you and me, it is cold. But it teaches you
to look inward, to talk to yourself, to cope with yourself, and to
know yourself. It's hard, unpleasant, but necessary, because at the
end of day, the only person you know well is yourself, the one who
will not leave you, is yourself, and the one who will put dinner on
your table, is yourself. I don't enjoy the loneliness a bit. But it's
inevitable, sooner or later, in life, that I have to face, to
survive. Those who are hoping to dodge this bullet, will be
disappointed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now, on the other side of my thoughts on this, is that there is a
common theme that occurs from generation to generation, from year to
year, from day to day, from person to person &amp;mdash; the wish of going
back in time, missing the past, whether it was a youth, a young love,
a wonderful time in life... why? From the picture and sound of this
woman, she is in her 20s I would guess. So really there isn't much to
go back to, when I'm speaking from my age. Yet, I remember the
feeling, I echo the thoughts, I agree with her sentiments, and I wish
to do the same. Sometimes I wonder when I hit 70s, which is another 20
some years later, looking back, wouldn't I wish I could come back to,
today!? But now being here, being right now, I don't want to be, here,
now, but to go back to a moment in time. How self-conflicting!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What is this that we want to go back to? Don't we actually only
implying a particular moment, period, but nothing before, nothing
after? And even for that moment and that period, aren't we also
thinking only a person being there, but no other &lt;em&gt;noises&lt;/em&gt;, so the
experience will be pure, even abstract? I think so. It is cherry
picking only the things you like, but can get away with things you
don't.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Logically speaking, this is the same that I despise those history
talks &amp;mdash; Song was fine, but not everyday. If to relive the glory
of a moment, great. But for over 200 years of days, and it would be
safe to bet they also had 24 hours each day, and feeling hungry as
regular as we do today, life, most of them, were filled with
things from Pandora's box.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So city likely amplifies these things, and accelerates the pace that
you must face reality. The real question is always &amp;mdash; do you want
to know, and be unhappy? or be ignorant, and be happy?&lt;/p&gt;</content><category term="thoughts"></category><category term="thoughts"></category></entry><entry><title>What is your song</title><link href="https://fengxia41103.github.io/myblog/what%20is%20your%20song.html" rel="alternate"></link><published>2019-03-20T11:00:00-04:00</published><updated>2019-03-20T11:00:00-04:00</updated><author><name>Feng Xia</name></author><id>tag:fengxia41103.github.io,2019-03-20:/myblog/what is your song.html</id><summary type="html">&lt;iframe width="100%" height="700"

&lt;p&gt;Have you ever felt, that someday, there is a song, that makes you
think of, someone? And this song, always, always, reminds of, of that
person, regardless how remote and how far it has been. Somehow, this
person, is tied to this tune, to a scene in your head, in your memory,
that you can still recall the moment you first heard it, as if the
first time you met him/her, the first time you went out, the first
time you had fun at park, playing arcade, watching a video, sharing a
dessert, drinking coffee, window shopping, or just wondering around in
the city, by the suburb, along an unknown road that led to somewhere,
but neither of you cared, because it was the moment being next to each
other mattered, and you could go anywhere with him/her, however where
the road is going to lead.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Isn't it love? or just a 心动? or it's the beginning of a love, that

&lt;p&gt;Isn't it love? or just a 心动? or it's the beginning of a love, that
is always beautiful, touching, making your soul nervous, tremble even,
and leave a stamp on your memory, that you can not forget, even when
it's buried deep, in history, in the past, in neglect, in a corner of
mind that doesn't see light of the day anymore.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yet, the song, is like a key, that opens a door that had been sealed
with dust, letting light peek into once more, as if someone stepping
into an ancient ruin, they see spider webs, see things scattered
around, see broken pieces here and there, and then, they also see the
same as it was left &amp;mdash; placed in the same place, in the same
position, clock stopped in time, nothing changed, but everything has
changed, gone.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;How sad! So this is the power of a song, the power of remembering what
you had, the power of not being able to forget. There is an army of
sci-fi movies that travel back in time or forward into the
future. It's a cliché now if you set a story in this setting. But what
people often do not realize is that, everyone of us, every mind that
lives and breathes, every heart that has ever been touched by another
body, every tune that makes you sad, makes you wonder, makes you want
to drop everything you ever had, only if you could be back with, or to
be with, someone, somewhere, someday, is traveling, in space, in time.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yes, it is sad. But it is also beautiful, because it is tender, it is
sensitive, it is what makes you feel to cry, and I have to say, tear,
is a wonderful thing. It's not cowardish to cry. It is rather noble,
for you still feel the pain, still remember the pain, still hope it
could have been different, even though it is set, done, finished, no
going back. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;They say Athena put HOPE as the last gift in Pandora's box as a savior
to human; some argue that HOPE is just another evil (so don't be
fooled by its name), otherwise why it was in that box? I don't
know. Maybe it is. Then this is an evil that gives you a string to
hang on, even though, it is false.&lt;/p&gt;</content><category term="thoughts"></category><category term="love"></category></entry><entry><title>Human grouping</title><link href="https://fengxia41103.github.io/myblog/human%20grouping.html" rel="alternate"></link><published>2019-03-15T16:49:00-04:00</published><updated>2019-03-15T16:49:00-04:00</updated><author><name>Feng Xia</name></author><id>tag:fengxia41103.github.io,2019-03-15:/myblog/human grouping.html</id><summary type="html">&lt;figure class="col s12"&gt;

has developed, was probably caused by you (or people like you), but do
not belong to you, nor will give it you. If you are even willing to go
the distance that "oh s/he is sharing this with fans", or that "s/he
actually knows who I am", wonderful! But again, I would argue that
this is the same logic as those terrible 富二代 &amp;larr; they are so
proud of their wealth, but they didn't earn a dime that they are
squandering. I guess the only thing they deserve to be proud of is
that they had luck to be born in a rich family. Well, luck is
important I admit.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The same saying goes when 袁老师 criticizes those people who are proud
of a mountain or a lake that their area has &amp;larrr; God has placed
such wonder there, which really had nothing to with you (well, in all
cased, the creation was done without ever had you in mind, don't you
agree!?) So what's for you to be proud of!? What can make you proud,
however, should be something coming out of yourself, based on your own
effort, even be it a extreme luck, that you moved a finger, and caused
it to happen, such as education, such as being a good flute player, or
a runner, or a kind-hearted person, or being brave, having integrity,
being honest... something, something of you, that you have struggled
with, battled with, worked on. The rest &amp;mdash; beauty, look, smarter
brain, better hair, taller in height, quicker in reflex, better in
weight (or worse in weight) &amp;larr; all these, were born with, that you
did not have a say in making that decision. Nature did. So there isn't
really anything you can feel proud of (or ashamed of). Period.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But then, we all want to be connected with someone, something,
extraordinary &amp;mdash; "I know who and who", "Yeah I use that app (long
before they got popular)" "I read a great book (written by whom and
whom)" "I love his movie/music/muscle/moustache".... as if now, we are
part of that ring, that circle,that we now share the fortune and fame
and good luck and whatever! We are so uncomfortable with ourselves
that we have to prove ourselves only through a reflection of such
claims. Why!?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Don't we all also struggle to buy a unique piece of cloth, or a unique
talent, or an above-average something, anything, so to be outstanding,
standing out, different!? Then why bother to associate with any of
these other stuff as if they are also defining you!? Why, do we need
an identity, at all!? Just to know who I am? what I should do? What if
I just don't know who I am!? what if I just got a wrong answer but not
knowing it for the rest of life? what if I change identities once a
while, or all the time? Does it, then, change anything!?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We all know names are just made up labels. People who believe a good
name can bring (or change) one's life is quite, optimistic, and
probably will always be true &amp;mdash; life is indeed a butterfly
effect, you never know what a dial will make some part of your life
vibrate, shaping up, or shaping down. There is no turning back, and
there is no peek into the future. Every step, every decision, every
moment, every thought, every move, every blink, every breath, is a
blow into this mystery that can change your course. How scary! and how
powerless!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Just learned a phrase that anger is because you are mad at your own's
incompetency. Very true. I feel angry, sad, depressed, frustrated
these days. Often they felt it's someone else's fault that caused all
these &amp;mdash; pretty much the same argument Noah gave me when he is
caught doing something wrong. Yet, in reality, it's me being angry at
myself for being so powerless to change, to influence, to make things
happen (the way I wish), to be with the person I love, to take care
the people I care, to be nice and forgiving to many, to be happy with
myself. Indeed, the feeling this powerless sense is the root of anger.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So, it seems human are destined to be angry, if one chooses to be
objective. Alternatively, let's (pretend to) define an identity, by
associating myself with something, great, somewhere, great, someone,
great, to think about it, even the volunteer work I'm thinking to do,
isn't it just another thing I'm trying to be associated with, as part
of my identity!? &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Siqi said she is often influenced by people around her. I used to
think she will grow out of this. Now, I would say, there is no growing
out of it &amp;larr; I'm needing an identity too, by deflecting all these
external things onto myself. We can't live without a self-image, I
guess. We, maybe, can choose the mirrors to use. But even that, is
shaky. I always worried that she will be surrounded by people I don't
think they deserve to be near her. But what do I know? My mirrors are
not necessarily better, and the bottom line, I don't know what
identity she wants.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If beggars can not be choosers, then we are all just begging for an
identity, and we don't get to choose which. We can work hard to be a
good student, to have good education, to be smarter than what nature
gives us, to be a good person. Not that you can choose to be one, but
you ended up having a few good mirrors around, and that makes you,
look better.&lt;/p&gt;</content><category term="thoughts"></category><category term="thoughts"></category></entry><entry><title>Self-disciplined</title><link href="https://fengxia41103.github.io/myblog/self-disciplined.html" rel="alternate"></link><published>2019-03-14T13:29:00-04:00</published><updated>2019-03-14T13:29:00-04:00</updated><author><name>Feng Xia</name></author><id>tag:fengxia41103.github.io,2019-03-14:/myblog/self-disciplined.html</id><summary type="html">&lt;figure class="col l7 m7 s12"&gt;

willingness to put down something like this to cleanse oneself.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But this faces the exact same question raised &amp;mdash; who determines
good or bad? and if we take it into the free-market argument, wouldn't
the free market force distill these bad guys because they will not get
enough business, and will then be phased out? Apparently, the
Internet, or the Google's Ad market, is telling us otherwise &amp;rarr;
the free market force is not sufficient to self regulate its own
health &amp;larr; it simply can not keep up with the number of bad guys
who are equally creative and smart, and have stronger motivation to
game the system for advantage. The only defense is an arms race
&amp;mdash; that by putting a clear policy upfront as requirement to
participate in this market, and an efficient police force to monitor
and rule out violations.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We used to scold these 城管 because they have absolute power over
under-powered street peddlers, and as Acton said, "Power corrupts;
absolute power corrupts absolutly", this is inevitable. However, it is
unclear either alternative is a better picture. We are assuming street
peddlers are morally sounder than these 城管 due to their
weakness. Of course, this is not true &amp;mdash; an averaged distribution
of demographics is more likely to be true than false among these
population, or any group, if no other data to back it up. Further,
even if this is true, it says nothing about the shift of such &lt;em&gt;high&lt;/em&gt;
moral standard once they are granted w/ more power! As a matter of
fact, history has proven too many times that what corrupts a person is
exact the transition from a low position to a high position.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So, what other options? Police force? I hate this idea, but this logic
seems to be the conclusion we are drawing &amp;larr; if you can't
discipline yourself, then an external force must be introduced. Call
it police, or whatever you want, but that doesn't change the nature of
this force, nor why it was introduced at first place.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Then, what about this force now being granted with absolute power?
Isn't it the 城管 we just mentioned? or an authoritarian regime? I
mean, it can take many forms, but ingredient maintains. I don't think
I will like that at all. I don't think this is even the debate of
democracy vs. non-democracy. This is a paradox of how to main order.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We all agree we want to maintain order. I just argued that we can't
self-discipline sufficiently to avoid a police force. I'm worried
police force gains absolute power. Then what? A police of a police?
then another layer on top? and on and on and on.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I really should read Alice in Wonderland. Now everywhere I turn, every
topic I write, seems to be an analogy of an endless rabbit hole. Maybe
it's my analytical thinking is the problem &amp;mdash; just too dumb to
figure it out, but too smart to be content with ignorance.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It's the dilemma of me &amp;mdash; caught in between, not alive, not
dead. &lt;/p&gt;</content><category term="thoughts"></category><category term="thoughts"></category></entry><entry><title>Self-esteem</title><link href="https://fengxia41103.github.io/myblog/self-esteem.html" rel="alternate"></link><published>2019-03-07T09:00:00-05:00</published><updated>2019-03-07T09:00:00-05:00</updated><author><name>Feng Xia</name></author><id>tag:fengxia41103.github.io,2019-03-07:/myblog/self-esteem.html</id><summary type="html">&lt;figure class="col l6 m6 s12"&gt;

&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I start to understand now, better perhaps, than before, that what
self-esteem feels like, and why women have this anxiety of so.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;With aging I start to notice that hair is becoming less, and this has
been bothering me for the last few weeks when I started to notice
it. Not that I'm going bald or anything, just that comparing to what I
had, it feels, less.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Then, all of sudden, I start to realize this is exactly how women feel
all along in their life, that they want to lose weight, they want to
look young! I have always laughed at such attempt, calling it a &lt;strong&gt;lost
battle&lt;/strong&gt; because there is really no point of trying so, for that first
of all it doesn't really change who they are, no man is going to love
or not love you just because you have a few extra pounds. Actually,
most of them who are bothered by their "weight" look just fine,
really, in my eyes at least, there is not obesity or anything even
close …&lt;/p&gt;</summary><content type="html">&lt;figure class="col l6 m6 s12"&gt;

or not love you just because you have a few extra pounds. Actually,
most of them who are bothered by their "weight" look just fine,
really, in my eyes at least, there is not obesity or anything even
close to that mark, so the crying is more like a crying wolf to me,
and probably to most men! and also, honestly even though all men love
girls in their young 20s, grown ups also understand that what is
important is who you are, is the mind, not the body, and the
desperation of making the face look young will only make the wrinkles
on the neck or hand even more standing out &amp;larr; it's like that
empire who walks around naked but may be having a perfect hairdo, so
what's the point.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But now, I think I see better. All these, regardless it's hair, or
wrinkle, or weight, or whatever that may be bothering you, the
underline message is the same, that there is something you don't have
control over (aging, after all, is the most natural outcome one can
expect, besides death, and arguably tax, but that's a man-made thing
so I would discount it some, thought it's the most surely thing, and
the most annoying thing!), and it is in a conflicting course of an
image you would like yourself to possess. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So there are two folds of this line &amp;mdash; an image you project for
yourself, and a unstoppable force to destroy that image. Rationally if
the force is beyond one's control, the only alternative is to change
the projection, isn't it!? But here where human mind gets tangled and
anxious. We are so clinging onto that projection that our entire so
called self-esteem is based on it, and without self-esteem, well, the
life is really like a house of cards &amp;mdash; it collapses by taking
just one card away, especially one from the bottom, such as this
self-esteem thing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It's lucky for men, most of them, that they are so immature in their
young that they all feel great about themselves, had an illusion that
they are the most handsome, coolest guy, by looking into a mirror to
admire one's face, hair, or expansive car, or sport, or just that
man's organ, while at the same age, women, on the other hand, are
living in anxiety for their weight, for their under-developed or over
developed breast, for their "imperfect" figure, for not having that
handbag, or a lip stick, or a coat that fits this year's fashion, and
so on &amp;larr; so the feeling of anxiety starts much much much earlier
for women than for men, how unfortunate this is!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But then, this long agony of living with anxiety also make women,
wiser, more mature, and more self-aware. Many men, even in their 30s,
40s, or even older, live like a kid who never grew up &amp;mdash; they
take themselves to be the center of the universe, and live by their
imaginary image, perfectly in peace, and proud of themselves, while
their wives, girlfriends, lovers, mistresses, daughters, see through
all these and are in struggle to fight off the uncomfort such
realization brings.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Jessie said that ignorance is a bless. Indeed. If only I could always
live in such a bless, by not knowing so much, not thinking so much,
not being so self-aware, life would be a much happier journey than me
now worrying about such a nuance as a hair! Yes one can also argue
that this is only so because I'm not wise enough to think OVER these
thoughts. Once I become truly wise, such thing certainly doesn't
bother me a bit anymore.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Well, true and true. At the meantime, I'm also thinking, if anxiety
has made women a smarter group comparing to men, maybe, it's a good
thing to have &amp;rarr; that I'm not bloated to believe in that I'm the
handsomest person on earth, and will become humble, truer of who I am,
what I can and can not do, and in the end, a more honest person, I
hope, than without such pain.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I don't know. Giving up a self-made image is hard. I don't think we
need to. But we can look back to ourselves in a better mirror, though
you don't look good in that mirror, it's one better than fooling
ourselves, or being fooled &amp;mdash; we are all, and just, who we are,
no more, and no less. At least, that's what others see.&lt;/p&gt;</content><category term="thoughts"></category><category term="thoughts"></category></entry><entry><title>Rain rain rain</title><link href="https://fengxia41103.github.io/myblog/rain%20rain%20rain.html" rel="alternate"></link><published>2019-03-01T11:03:00-05:00</published><updated>2019-03-01T11:03:00-05:00</updated><author><name>Feng Xia</name></author><id>tag:fengxia41103.github.io,2019-03-01:/myblog/rain rain rain.html</id><summary type="html">&lt;figure class="col s12"&gt;

&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Rain, rain, rain. Not quite actually. It's cloudy, misty, and is about
to rain. Nothing really special for an early Spring day. Some flowers
have bloomed, and some are on their way.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Like walking in this mist, reminds me the days I was wondering around
in Suzhou, the college spring break when I was still young. Hard to
believe it is the 25th anniversary since graduation! My god, 25 years,
what have I done!? It is such a long time, yet, I feel I have achieve
little, changed much, and what I have is as little as what I had.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I start to understand why parents will feel their children being the
only, or the most proud of, accomplishment they have in their life
&amp;mdash; I probably will feel so, too, because the child is the only
thing you must stick around, can't easily call a quit (well, for a
responsible parent of course), so once you persist it for like 10 or
20 years, looking back, you can't help feeling proud of yourself,
feeling that …&lt;/p&gt;</summary><content type="html">&lt;figure class="col s12"&gt;

20 years, looking back, you can't help feeling proud of yourself,
feeling that is an accomplishment &amp;larr; indeed it is! &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This makes me wonder, and probably it is true since there are many
talks about it that &lt;strong&gt;being persistent is the hardest, and the only way
to achieve something extraordinary&lt;/strong&gt; (well, hardly we will say all kids
are extraordinary. But in reality, raising them to adulthood itself is
extraordinary, when was the last time you did anything for 20 years
without budging, without quiting, and still doing it!?). So, I guess
if we can take anything and keep doing it for 20 years, we can call it
an achievement!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But then, sadly, after 25 years since college, I experienced much,
traveled, hopped jobs, dated, married, divorced, cried, laughed,
switched hobbies, suffered some, achieve some, gave up some, held on
some, kept some, lost some, remember some, forgot.. maybe some, too,
and, the only thing I could feel as an achievement, remotely, is that
Noah is 11 years old, not that I never thought about quiting (and I'm
about to walk away by giving myself the excuse of doing volunteer
works, somewhere, just not here), but I hadn't had the gut, nor the
determination, to leave. So I sticked around, and being his dad for 11
years, and counting still.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So that's how life awards a person &amp;larr; by making it hard, and hard
to quit, it gives you something, likely the only thing, you will find
worth feeling proud of at the end of life. But if you go by your own
will, you feel happy from moment to moment, but like a happy banquet,
it felt great at the time, then, it left you with little impression,
no scar, no hurt feeling, but its satisfaction lasts for, 4 hours?
then, you feel hungry again, need food again, and sadly, no banquet,
no food, of any kind, will taste good if you eat it ever time you feel
so. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But pain, agony, regret, lost love, feeling of missing someone, the
distant memory of walking in the rain, of picking up at airport, of
the moment I saw you flashing by to pick up your luggage, of putting
scarf around you before walking out to a chilly Shanghai winter day,
of following you hovering on your segaway, of seeing the surprise on
your face when you came home and discovered the wonderful smell was
coming from our kitchen.. they linger, they persist, they probably
will fade, or will be gone entirely when I'm like Dad losing all my
sense and memory. How sad. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But even so, they will be the last to go. So I hope, so I wish, so I
pray, the image of you, be the last thing leaving my mind. Then, it
will all be empty, blank, and that should be the end of my
existence, as me. The body may continue to drag on. But without the
thought of you when I ever walked in a rain, in a misty early Spring
day, there is no soul, and I would feel nothing anymore.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Every drop of rain in the air, every mist floating around, every
flower come and go, every season, every cloud, every day, is only a
transformation, of you, so I wish it to be.&lt;/p&gt;</content><category term="thoughts"></category><category term="love"></category></entry><entry><title>What is engineering</title><link href="https://fengxia41103.github.io/myblog/what%20is%20engineering.html" rel="alternate"></link><published>2019-02-21T10:22:00-05:00</published><updated>2019-02-21T10:22:00-05:00</updated><author><name>Feng Xia</name></author><id>tag:fengxia41103.github.io,2019-02-21:/myblog/what is engineering.html</id><summary type="html">&lt;figure class="col l6 m6 s12"&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I have been thinking, and probably being pissed off at the current
status of the work, that whether the concept of engineering in my mind
is the problem, or what I perceive is correct and it's the others who
are not getting it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So, what is engineering? I recall back in high school when we were to
enter the application for college. Being a naive spoiled kid back
then, I had no idea what I wanted to do, nor what myself is or can be
good at. I remember my dad told me that after meeting with my teacher
班主任, the guy felt I could be good at engineering. "What a nonsense!"
I thought. I had no idea what engineering requires, had little
interest in engineering (though my parents both were engineers), and
certainly didn't think myself fit that profile at all &amp;mdash; Noah's
absent-mindness everyday constantly reminds me what I was like back
then. So if anything, I was as far from being a good engineer as an
engineer could possibly be.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But …&lt;/p&gt;</summary><content type="html">&lt;figure class="col l6 m6 s12"&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But, things change, I guess, and people do change (! what a
surprise!). Growing up I found myself being more and more intolerable
of the non-detail-oriented person and things, and wanted everything to
be fitting in an organized way, in a well-oiled smooth operation, and
taking proud when things work, and feeling frustrated when things
aren't. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When I draw diagrams, I like things to be &lt;strong&gt;aligned to grid&lt;/strong&gt;, and the
connectors snapped to another shape so they will move together without
shifting position. I will make sure all labels have the same text
alignment, both vertically and horizontally, and shapes in a row must
be evenly spaced, and lines must be consistently the same size, so are
the fonts, and so on and on. And Powerpoints, I can't believe how many
times engineers, who have been known to be non-artistic type, are
willingly to propel such bias against themselves by delivering a slide
that is ugly because details such as alignment is not even right!!!
You know, whenever I saw something like that, I wanted to
&lt;strong&gt;scream&lt;/strong&gt;!!! &amp;rarr; for God sake, you call yourself an engineer, and
yet you can't even get a slide right, how could I trust you to build a
next jet engine, or write code claiming to be good quality!? &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You know, I firmly believe in &lt;strong&gt;consistency&lt;/strong&gt; &amp;larr; I think a person
is, and must be, and better be, consistent, which means that if you do
your laundry messily, have a messy car, I will simply discard you for
being possibly a good engineer. Period!  Because things like this
speaks a threshold of tolerance of mess &amp;mdash; all the ones I just
mentioned tell me that you have a high tolerance of it, which, well,
in engineering, I believe is a terrible news.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What is engineering then? At this point I believe engineering is
everything to fit together and work as it should. In GRE we learned
the trick that whenever you see an answer says &lt;code&gt;everything&lt;/code&gt;, it must
be wrong, because there isn't such as possibility as
&lt;code&gt;everything&lt;/code&gt;. Well, engineering is exactly trying to achieve this
impossibility, and that's why it is hard, very very very hard. When
I saw emails or heard discussion that "oh it's broken, let's fix it",
I just want to shout it out that "come on guys! what is broken? how is
it broken? how did you judge it is broken? what is the reference of
&lt;code&gt;not broken&lt;/code&gt;!? what is the thought/analysis/guess of why so? and any
ideas how to rule out possibilities of cause and find the problem? and
any backup plan if we fail to find the cause, any action we can take
to isolate the problem? or to alleviate it?"... I don 't get it,
really! To me, a vague statement of "it's broken" is &lt;strong&gt;not only
meaningless, but aggravating, and honestly, I think it is the problem
itself!!&lt;/strong&gt; &amp;rarr; exactly because of the mentality of such non-detail
oriented statement (I would go even further to say that whoever makes
such statement is completely irresponsible, in engineering term!),
will, and must have, driven the work and process that has created this
problem at the first place!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I'm amazed how many times people are rushed, or willingly rush into, a
work without considering left and right how many pieces we are dealing
with, how these pieces can fit together, how they can go wrong, what
is the assumption, how to verify these assumptions.... These types of
questions pop to my mind as soon as I start hearing even a faint
proposal. Yet, for many, I do mean, many many many, others, they don't
even occur to them, never bothered by them, and then get everybody,
the whole team, into a fire drill mode, as if this is what engineering
is about &amp;mdash; putting out fire because things are broken!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yes, things being broken is the constant status of engineer's life;
&lt;strong&gt;No&lt;/strong&gt;, if fire is not becoming rarer and less severe, we are not
engineers, we are criminal who is setting out fires, for ourselves, so
to keep us employed, and appear to be busy!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What a BS!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I'm really curious how they had built Golden Gate Bridge back then? or
the Sydney Bridge? or any of those enigneering marvels!? How could
they pull it off with work of hundreds, thousands, of people/labor,
yet, the things all came together, fit! Looking at them, you will see,
engineering.&lt;/p&gt;</content><category term="thoughts"></category><category term="thoughts"></category></entry><entry><title>Strange fate</title><link href="https://fengxia41103.github.io/myblog/strange%20fate.html" rel="alternate"></link><published>2019-02-15T11:08:00-05:00</published><updated>2019-02-15T11:08:00-05:00</updated><author><name>Feng Xia</name></author><id>tag:fengxia41103.github.io,2019-02-15:/myblog/strange fate.html</id><summary type="html">&lt;figure class="col s12"&gt;

&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Have you had this feeling before? that something is off, and things
are happening in a strange way?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is how I felt yesterday and the day before. Went to see a medical
surgeon to take care of that bump on the back of my head. At parking
lot, out of the twenty some years of driving a car, I ended up
stepping forward and ran over a curb, and of the entire way back home,
I felt my mind was just somewhere. I didn't know what was happening,
just that strange feeling that my mind was off, off. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Then at night at the end of scrum, Eric asked me whether I have seen
his email. So I found this email, that came from some BS email
address:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="highlight"&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;KANDULA&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;VENKATA&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;NARENDRA&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;REDDY&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;bugbounty10378&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nv"&gt;@gmail&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;com&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;and it has caused an &lt;strong&gt;uproar&lt;/strong&gt; inside the company that some 
trade secret has been leaked by rouge developer and such, myself
included (well, technically yes, but then, the internal analysis said
that I'm no longer working here... so much …&lt;/p&gt;</summary><content type="html">&lt;figure class="col s12"&gt;

&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;and it has caused an &lt;strong&gt;uproar&lt;/strong&gt; inside the company that some 
trade secret has been leaked by rouge developer and such, myself
included (well, technically yes, but then, the internal analysis said
that I'm no longer working here... so much a joke for taking the
matter seriously!). Instead of anyone questioning the legitimacy and
credibility of this strange looking BS email address, every single on
on that email thread acted as if something terribly immoral and wrong
had just happened:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Please provide an overview of what the GITHub project was being used
for?  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Please provide an overview of the functionality and type of
information the source code was used to access?  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Please indicate who
authorized you to store the source code and information in GIT Hub?
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So it turned out that it was a code I pushed into my gitlab account to
showoff the REACTjs way of building a dashboard based on YAML config,
and the example config files had these so called &lt;em&gt;sensitive data&lt;/em&gt; that
this &lt;code&gt;bugbounty10378&lt;/code&gt; guy, for whatever purpose (but honestly, doesn't
this count like a blackmail of a kind!? what the heck is this email!?
and why would anyone take it seriously!? Just some random guy scanning
github for a string pattern &lt;code&gt;&amp;lt;company name&amp;gt;.com&lt;/code&gt;, and then for
something like a URL, or a username? a pwd?) For God sake, let me give
a legitimate URL we are using internally in our development which
controls million dollar worth of equipment:
&lt;code&gt;http://10.240.44.48&lt;/code&gt;... does it mean anything to you!? to anyone!?
and how about I give you my credential for a kick, &lt;code&gt;fxiaeo942423,
bbba39430w908&lt;/code&gt;? Go have fun!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is turning into a witch hunt, and everyone is acting seriously to
show his/her value in the command chain, while, the only message I got
for being an active developer &amp;mdash; don't write any code! The more
you write, the more likely you will miss one line or two in your git
commit in which you had put an &lt;em&gt;internal&lt;/em&gt; URL, a user account
credential, and so on. And to make things even worse, these commit
histories are permanent, like a prisoner's tattoo on your face, done.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yes, it is a security hazzard, no doubt about that; No, no developer
in his/her sane mode is consciously committing a crime here. If you
folks have ever written a code and made a commit, you know the zillion
&lt;code&gt;if-else&lt;/code&gt; you had to take care of, the grueling hours of debugging to
make it &lt;strong&gt;work&lt;/strong&gt;, and the relief when the code is finally &lt;strong&gt;pushed to
git&lt;/strong&gt;... well, at the end of all the exhausting hours, remembering to
comb through all the code again so to mosaic all these &lt;strong&gt;sensntive&lt;/strong&gt;
data, is the last thing on dev's mind; besides, having them there is
likely the only way to get the code working, even though dev knows
it's just for now, and it's bad practice, s/he is afraid to touch
code, even to change a newline, can break it!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Well, that's the sad reality of software engineering. For all the
uproar people who jumped on this &lt;code&gt;bounty&lt;/code&gt; thread, maybe you should
take a working code, mask all these data you care about, and QA it to
make sure it's still working, before dev can commit such a
sin. Honestly, I would love someone to distilll my code to make it,
safe. If you know Python, and Ansible, and REACTjs, and jQuery, and
materialized CSS, and Django, and Postgresql, and Celery, and Tower,
and Satellite, and a few other technologies/applications I'm dealing
w/ everyday, email me, pls. I would love to meet you, and maybe you
can work for me.&lt;/p&gt;

  was in 2004 just before I was leaving for Beijing. Fourteen years later,
  there they are again, glittering, haven't changed.&lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There must be an interlink between humans. I can't believe that a
movie like &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fahrenheit_11/9"&gt;Fahrenheit 11/9&lt;/a&gt; would have made me to stop in the
middle because, watching people cry is so, tough.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I don't know. Does everybody feel this way, I wonder? I'm sure they
do. We know movies are touching, so are some entertainment shows, that
having somebody cry always make the audiences, weep, and freeze, and
make the moment memorable. So this must be universal. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What about in real life? I have seen people cry, someone close to me,
some just strangers passing by, but why I feel more touched when
watching them on screen instead of seeing them live? Is it the music?

the background noise, no one talks, no one even moves, it is only this
person, occupying the entire view of your eyes, who is, weeping, and
even more so when s/he is trying to hold it back because of the
camera &amp;mdash; these, make the moment, so much more, powerful. So I
feel touched, feel sad, feel the agony, the sympathy, the feeling to
weep together... how strange!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Then, there was she, the dearest to my soul, who cried and cried, and
I felt nothing but guilt, a tremendous weight on my mind, on my heart,
that I wanted to stop it, to stop whatever that caused her
unhappiness, even if that means to fight the world, to die, or to
leave. It's hard.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I wish I could tear more, cause I know it carries your sadness out so
you don't accumulate them inside. Yet, I can't. My mind is always so
logical and calm that it hardly get to the point to tear. Yet, I am
watching is documentary that isn't even a &lt;em&gt;good&lt;/em&gt; one. But when the
interviewee was crying, I felt this pain, so great, that I had to stop
the movie and write these down! I guess that speaks that I still have
some emotion left, that I am capable to be humane and to connect with
someone. It's not kindness I would say; it's just human nature, that
has not yet gone by grinding life. How much can we retain? and can we
get it back later once we become, relaxed, different, or just passing
the bump of that grinding life? I don't know. I hope they don't just
ever reduce but can never be refilled. I hope not.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Emotion, is indeed the only thing that defines a person, defines you,
and me. Maybe, one day, we could save tears, save them, even on
camera, or etching in mind, like I have done, that the same image will
be replayed, over, and over, and over, as a reminder to yourself, that
there is someone you can feel, there is some moments you don't forget,
and there are tears that makes you cry, because you still love.&lt;/p&gt;</content><category term="thoughts"></category><category term="thoughts"></category></entry><entry><title>Forget someone</title><link href="https://fengxia41103.github.io/myblog/forget%20someone.html" rel="alternate"></link><published>2019-01-30T12:34:00-05:00</published><updated>2019-01-30T12:34:00-05:00</updated><author><name>Feng Xia</name></author><id>tag:fengxia41103.github.io,2019-01-30:/myblog/forget someone.html</id><summary type="html">&lt;figure class="col s12"&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Forget someone, is hard.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Your image kept popping into my head this morning, on treadmill, on a
path walked from building to building, in the sun, by the shadow of a
tree, in the cold winter air, or warmth of a ray that brings one of
billion-th of energy for the universe all the way to my body, a branch
without leaves but is secretly preparing to welcome the inevitable
Spring, a bird flying by, some geese who have started migrating north,
or my cats who snuggle by my side last night while I was having a late
night call, and getting up with me when he thought I was going to
reahch out more midnight snack for him....&lt;/p&gt;

wonder whether this is just me, or this is human nature that everyone
is capable of, but someone choose not to, and someone does? or is it a
capability that one is good at, while others don't? and can you gain
or improve this capability by, practice? or just born with a fixed
value that will, in a way, &lt;strong&gt;define you&lt;/strong&gt;!? &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I don't know. It certainly like an attribute that I have lived with,
and will not change. Maybe I don't want to change &amp;mdash; who should I
forget all these people, these people in my life who, at one point or
another, were so important to me, so close to me, that definitely
defined who I was, and led to who I am!? Why should I let it pass into
some oblivion? If I'm looking at Dad, I constant felt that there is a
stranger living in his body, because he has lost his conscience to
recollect his past, and without them, what defines him anymore!?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I don't want that. Thinking of you is hard. You feel so far away, and
I can't pull myself together if I start to wonder where you are, what
you do, how you are going by your life, and whom is by your
side... But I can't help it. You, took a spot in my mind, in my life,
and that spot, is so wonderful, so deep, that, if one day I could not
find it anymore, I will be lost.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If that happens, my dear 美丽的人, the true me has never forgotten, by
the year, the month, the day, the minute, the second, the every single
elapse of mind, of moment in life; the one who forgets, is not me
anymore.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Don't forget, I pray, till the day I die, till the day I am reborn,
over and over and over, just with a hope to, see you.&lt;/p&gt;</content><category term="thoughts"></category><category term="love"></category></entry><entry><title>Time</title><link href="https://fengxia41103.github.io/myblog/time.html" rel="alternate"></link><published>2019-01-30T09:40:00-05:00</published><updated>2019-01-30T09:40:00-05:00</updated><author><name>Feng Xia</name></author><id>tag:fengxia41103.github.io,2019-01-30:/myblog/time.html</id><summary type="html">&lt;figure class="col l6 m6 s12"&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Time is indeed relative. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I was talking to Noah about this this morning &amp;mdash; why one feels
the time in the morning always flies by?  Theoretically time is
uniform, it ticks by the second all the time, at the same pace. It
doesn't change over the course of a day, so why morning time feels
short? Well, we are not talking about bad days that you felt like
indefinite long, but just a regular Wednesday morning.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So here is my theory: &lt;strong&gt;I think time feels different because your
brain is operating at a different speed&lt;/strong&gt; &amp;rarr; in the morning, your
brain is slow to boot up, thus the constant flow of time feels a speed
train passing you by, again, this is arguably the &lt;em&gt;perception&lt;/em&gt; of time
by your brain (exactly). On the flip side, time will then feel short
when your brain is working at a higher speed. The experience will be
when you are in the zone of writing code or doing something, that you
&lt;em&gt;forgot about time&lt;/em&gt; and felt it was really short! I'm …&lt;/p&gt;</summary><content type="html">&lt;figure class="col l6 m6 s12"&gt;

when you are in the zone of writing code or doing something, that you
&lt;em&gt;forgot about time&lt;/em&gt; and felt it was really short! I'm sure everybody
will echo this experience. Following this logic, the feeling of time
should be defined as an &lt;strong&gt;efficiency factor&lt;/strong&gt;, or &lt;strong&gt;density&lt;/strong&gt;, or
&lt;strong&gt;velocity&lt;/strong&gt;,, of experience, that within a fixed number of ticks, the
more your brain worked and perceived, the higher the density, that the
shorter the time feels. Interesting. I wonder whether this is what
relativity theory says?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So, what is really time? Is it just another aspect of perception like
I have just said. We know it is a complete artificial thing, because
there isn't such a thing called TIME in nature. I like the motto of
Movado swatches that there isn't really 24 hours a day, just a fact
that sun rises and sets everyday, which then defines the notion of
time. Therefore there is a single dot on its watch's face that
represents, sun? and the minute and hour arms just go by it that
simulates sun rise and sun set. How genuine!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Time, thus, is really a human invention, and quite an arbitrary one,
that we divide time into 24 hours a day. Actually this hasn't been
always the case either. We know at different time and by society
people had used different calendar; so many have used different ways
to describe time &amp;mdash; how about bars on a prison wall, or a marks
on a tree bark! They are all indication of elapse of, time! 24-hour
day is just one of many ways human have used, and happens to be the
&lt;em&gt;going standard&lt;/em&gt; when I'm writing this. The problem at its core is a
math one &amp;larr; &lt;strong&gt;earth doesn't go around sun in a nicely rounded
integer value&lt;/strong&gt; (well, integer is another human invention to describe
nature, so it seems human is caught by his own inventions) So
regardless how we are wishing to give it a good chunk, say 24, or 16,
or 17.5 even, there is always a bit of residual to count in order to
make it &lt;strong&gt;accurate&lt;/strong&gt; &amp;mdash; accurate in the sense that what human
makes of it matches what nature shows (think of &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tropical_year"&gt;solar year&lt;/a&gt;,
aka. tropical year, that has 365.24219 days, or, be precise,
&lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ephemeris_day"&gt;ephemeris days&lt;/a&gt;). So you, every single &lt;strong&gt;noun&lt;/strong&gt; in such statement
is essentially another human invention that is to describe a, thing,
which requires definition, and if only all the definitions are hold
true at the same time, will such a statement be true and meaningful
(well, even the word "meaningful" or "true" requires definition and
scrutiny! How convoluted human language has become!!!!!) In the book
&lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/Seventy-Great-Inventions-Ancient-World/dp/0500051305"&gt;Seventy Great Inventions of the Ancient World&lt;/a&gt;, it talks quite a
bit of examples of time, such as the &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Maya_calendar"&gt;Maya Calendar&lt;/a&gt;. So if you are
not yet convinced that &lt;strong&gt;time is subjective&lt;/strong&gt;, read it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I can't find who said this, that &lt;strong&gt;the root of human tragedy is that
the wise takes every step full of hesitation, while the fool take
every resolutely (智慧的人每一步都犹豫不决，愚蠢的人每一步都步伐坚定)&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;</content><category term="thoughts"></category><category term="thoughts"></category></entry><entry><title>Bizzare logic</title><link href="https://fengxia41103.github.io/myblog/bizzare%20logic.html" rel="alternate"></link><published>2019-01-25T20:00:00-05:00</published><updated>2019-01-25T20:00:00-05:00</updated><author><name>Feng Xia</name></author><id>tag:fengxia41103.github.io,2019-01-25:/myblog/bizzare logic.html</id><summary type="html">&lt;figure class="col l5 m5 s12"&gt;

&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;U want know some bizzare logic? Here is one, from a terrible
ridiculous argument w/ Noah's mom.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;She said at dinner table that she has applied two charter schools for
Noah. I then asked what are these two schools, and want to know more
about them. We talked about Noah's middle school assignment, and she
was mentioning that charter school could be an option. I was rather
glad that she took an initiative, unlike before she wouldn't do
anything but to ask me to make a decision.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;However, this conversation derailed to the point that it was becoming
really bizzare. So she started telling me how bad west carry, the one
that Noah got assigned to go this year. So I said this is not what I'm
asking; I'm asking to know more about these two schools. Then she
started to say that I asked in such a challenging tone, that in the
end the conclusion was that I didn't respect her. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Why so? Because, according to her, I didn't listen and didn't try to …&lt;/p&gt;</summary><content type="html">&lt;figure class="col l5 m5 s12"&gt;

started to say that I asked in such a challenging tone, that in the
end the conclusion was that I didn't respect her. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Why so? Because, according to her, I didn't listen and didn't try to
understand her. While I often said that she didn't tell me much,
therefore making it impossible for me to understand her. Here, the
table is turned, that I didn't understand her because I didn't try
hard enough.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There it is, the logic &amp;mdash; &lt;strong&gt;Me&lt;/strong&gt;: you don't tell me anything, so I don't
understand you; &lt;strong&gt;She&lt;/strong&gt;: not that I didn't tell you anything, but you
didn't try hard enough to listen; &lt;strong&gt;Me&lt;/strong&gt;: I listened, but you don't
say anything, so what to listen to? &lt;strong&gt;She&lt;/strong&gt;: I told you, but you
didn't try hard enough.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;How wonderfully bizzare &amp;larr; You don't understand, because you didn't try
hard enough. This, is driving me, crazy.. well, it was, but not
anymore. I'm so grateful that we ended this relationship last year,
officially, so I don't get bothered by the idea that I'm still in this
bizzare loop, and have to deal with it as if this is important! &lt;strong&gt;No, it
is not only not important, it is utterly, bizzare!&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is truly an argument that has no ending. It will just go on and
on and on and on. If one perceives another as not listening, I don't
think there is anything one can do to change it. But then, perception,
she got really worked up when I concluded that everything is really
just perception, nothing you can do about, you are at the mercy of the
other party how s/he perceives your words &amp;mdash; it can be taken as a
wonderful communication and just what is needed, or, it can be
&lt;strong&gt;perceived&lt;/strong&gt; as having no information, no content, and not answering
the question at all.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Honestly, I really think everything, good or bad or whatever, is
completly a perception. But she disagree. I guess the only way to
disagree is that she still believes there is an objective truth, fact,
that you are not trying hard enough to be good, to listen, to
understand her mind.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But to me, I tried, I heard nothing, and this sad result, can only be
my perception &amp;mdash; I mean, what else could it be!!? I asked the
question for information, and it turned out that &lt;em&gt;I am not
listening&lt;/em&gt;!?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Isn't this, bizzare, or what!?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;PS. Surprisingly, I have written about &lt;a href="https://fengxia41103.github.io/myblog/logic.html"&gt;logic&lt;/a&gt; already.&lt;/p&gt;</content><category term="thoughts"></category><category term="thoughts"></category></entry><entry><title>human and perception</title><link href="https://fengxia41103.github.io/myblog/human%20and%20perception.html" rel="alternate"></link><published>2019-01-22T10:30:00-05:00</published><updated>2019-01-22T10:30:00-05:00</updated><author><name>Feng Xia</name></author><id>tag:fengxia41103.github.io,2019-01-22:/myblog/human and perception.html</id><summary type="html">&lt;figure class="col l6 m6 s12"&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I'm finding myself battling my own perception these days, a
lot. Perception isn't a new topic to me. I have analyzed in &lt;a href="https://fengxia41103.github.io/myblog/hurt feelings.html"&gt;hurt
feeling&lt;/a&gt; whether it is a reasonable action for Noah's mom to feel
hurt because of something I did, well, at least based on her
claim. But still, perception is such a fundamental thing of human,
that in this trip w/ Noah, and in the last few days when he and I were
both recovering from jetlag, this is the only thing I could think of
to reason how I had lost patience w/ him, and started to dislike more
and more of myself &amp;rarr; perception, is the evil cause of all human
unhappiness.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Cambodia, and the image of that place, was constantly on my mind this
morning. Watched two documentaries yesterday &amp;mdash; &lt;a href="http://www.savemyseoul.com/"&gt;save my
seoul&lt;/a&gt;, and one that talks about child trafficking in Siem Reap,
the city Noah and I just visited. And this morning Noah and I were

seoul&lt;/a&gt;, and one that talks about child trafficking in Siem Reap,
the city Noah and I just visited. And this morning Noah and I were
watching this really strange, and rather too realistic japanese movie
called &lt;em&gt;Happy Hour&lt;/em&gt;, in which four female friends, all in their 30s,
are going through their life and struggles, like everyone of us on
this planet, real, dull, pain, and 无奈. Then, everytime when someone
cried in the screen, I could feel the emotion, if not touching and
bringing myself to tears, at least, it would feel awkward, that makes
you want to run away.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What is it? Why human, on one hand sooo deeply touched and connected
with another human being, even if the other one is only an image, a
virtual strange in a screen!? I don't know him/her, but I felt the
upset, the tide of emotion that this person is going through. Is this
sympathy? imagination? Is this the final link that keep us sane, that
deep down in our soul there is a connection to each other, however
remote we become, how ever far we drift apart, however different we
all are, there is a string of humanity holding us together?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But then, why human also act in the completly opposite way, that being
cruel to each other, indifferent, deceiving, even many times outwright
bullying and humiliating!? Why? and what makes one doing one more than
the other? Do we have all have both sides on us, just that social
rule, education, self-discipline, and any other random idea that comes
across my path, that reins me from being the bad one? Well, isn't also
these &lt;em&gt;random idea&lt;/em&gt; that defines what is good and what is bad? So they
are their own judge and you are being put in a race one couldn't win!?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What is it? Why can someone achieve such a noble thing, like the guy in the
&lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Last_Samurai"&gt;The Last Samurai&lt;/a&gt; who has such a firm belief in their cause, and
acted with their soul and heart? and at the same time, someone who
tramped on everything to get his gain, but justified just the same?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The guy in this &lt;em&gt;Happy Hour&lt;/em&gt; movie who is divorcing one of the
women. He is a &lt;em&gt;rigid&lt;/em&gt; scientist, but honestly I couldn't see what is
&lt;em&gt;bad&lt;/em&gt; about him &amp;mdash; and yet, all the women seem to &lt;em&gt;see through&lt;/em&gt;
him and criticized him for being cold and impossible to live with! I
don't understand their POV, but I'm sure they have a point, otherwise,
why they say and act so uniformly, and being full confidence in their
statement? &amp;larr; I'm not one who can be convinced easily. But I would
admit their conclusion even though I don't understand a bit of how
they derived their points.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;How bizarre! Then Noah got up really early in morning, partly due to
his jetlag, partly because he could watch TV. I told him that he was a
good boy at Taikang because there were night shift staff entertain him
if he got up early. So being fair, it was really just &lt;strong&gt;my
perception&lt;/strong&gt; of him being a good boy because I didn't have to get up
w/ him and keep him entertained! So really, his being good or bad is
nothing but a result of my own's condition &amp;rarr; when I'm well rested
and lighthearted, I find him pleasant, smart, &lt;strong&gt;the best travel
buddy&lt;/strong&gt; to have; then, I'm tired, grumpy, occupied by memory and
criticism of his mom's handling of him, I put on a negative lens... So
in the end, he has always been, him; it's me who has shifted from one
end of the happiness spectrum to the other, and venting my frustration
and annoyance on him, and this, &lt;strong&gt;is what I'm battling w/ &amp;mdash; my
own perception&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So in the end, one is the enemy of his/her own. It is not bipolar; it
is nature. Like what I'm convinced that one's weakness is bound to be
the strength, I'm also convinced, that what I'm feeling is not only
natural, but insolvable. I can only feel and sense this world through
perception. It is the only way to function and react. Yet, it is also
the thing that creates an emotion in you, that makes this world an
unhappy place, and myself an unpleasant person to be.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Cursed.&lt;/p&gt;</content><category term="thoughts"></category><category term="thoughts"></category></entry><entry><title>Taikang 2019</title><link href="https://fengxia41103.github.io/myblog/taikang%202019.html" rel="alternate"></link><published>2019-01-14T15:00:00-05:00</published><updated>2019-01-14T15:00:00-05:00</updated><author><name>Feng Xia</name></author><id>tag:fengxia41103.github.io,2019-01-14:/myblog/taikang 2019.html</id><summary type="html">&lt;figure class="col s12"&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Dear friends of the 19th floor,&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At time of departing, there is always something come to mind that I
feel to speak and to write. So here it is. Take it as a "Thank you"
note, or just a plain letter, from someone who had the privilege live
with this crew for a few weeks, being able to see and hear what your
day is like, and want you to know how wonderful you really are.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you have ever in doubt of your job and the life you are giving to
these patients in your nursing, I hope you will find my letter
comforting, and encouraging. Not that I want to pump you up by
persuading how important your job is; but by pointing out a fact that
each time when I visited, including this time, that I noticed the mark
this work has left on you &amp;mdash; a small wrinkle, a gray hair, a look
from lacking sleep, a body that speaks "I'm tired" yet you keep giving
to these people as if this …&lt;/p&gt;</summary><content type="html">&lt;figure class="col s12"&gt;

this work has left on you &amp;mdash; a small wrinkle, a gray hair, a look
from lacking sleep, a body that speaks "I'm tired" yet you keep giving
to these people as if this is your first day. I feel sad. But I know
what these have been translated to &amp;mdash; it's the healthy look on my
dad, the better walk of another 爷爷/奶奶, a recovery from another flu
by somebody, and the clean/pleasant smell on these people who have
lost control over life, but you are a string to tie them from slipping
down.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It is a daunting task you have decided to take. It is only for us to
observe how a lunch madness can be, how testing it is to feed when
s/he chooses to go with their own mind, leaving you sitting there and
wonder how such a difficult and unrewarding thing to spend your
life on. "Why can't he just open that mouth, and let me feed!", I
wanted to scream sometimes. But I have seen nothing comparing to
you. I could only imagine how you could still put up a smily face and
joke about it, and be nice and friendly to them, to each other, and to
this life.It is not easy &amp;mdash; this, I must say, is a complete
understatement. This, is mission impossible, for you to keep an upbeat
spirit day and night, literally, when you are here, and to be as
responsible and as responsive as you have been everyday. But indeed,
you did it, you are doing it. For this, I truly admire your endurance
and your spirit, because this is the side of humanity that I don't
find much anymore in anywhere outside this place.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Coming to here is like coming home, and it is really each of you who
made it feel home. What is home? &amp;mdash; A place you feel warmth, feel
safe, feel peace. I think you will be laughing at me now that I use
the word &lt;em&gt;peace&lt;/em&gt; to describe your day. It is anything but
peaceful. Yet, my dear friends, you don't know how much peace you have
created for us, for us families and friends whose life will have been
an utter chaos if not because of your existence. Without 19th floor
and you, it could only be despair. This is home, it makes me feel
warm, makes me feel safe, makes me feel, peace.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I wish Noah would grow up someday liking this type of work, and be
like one of you who can makes a difference in others' life. If parents
always want the best for their child, this place and this experience
will be the best one could give him. Next time when I knock on the
door, some will look familiar, some will be strangers. I will see more
gray hairs perhaps, more wrinkles, more tired looks... I know I'll
feel sad, probably so are you, and we will see each other how much
life has changed us, and yet, how little these patients have changed
&amp;mdash; in physics, they say the total mass in this universe is a
constant. I wonder maybe love is, also, that by giving away so much by
you, the people here are kept from becoming empty. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Thank you for letting us stay and being part of this.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Truly,&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Let me talk about OS. This has been an annoying topic recently due to
the ZTE fiasco, which to me is a running joke on its own &amp;mdash; &lt;a href="https://money.cnn.com/2018/06/22/news/companies/zte-us-fine-trade-case/index.html"&gt;one
billion dollar fine&lt;/a&gt;, and we got nothing but a bunch of BS articles
circulating on in wechat that arouses nationalistic sentiments with
conspiracy theory, but nothing else.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The common focus point of these arguments are two things &amp;mdash; OS,
and CPU. When they talk about CPU, as if there is only one maker
called Intel, and if only China could have developed its own CPU, the
threat is over. Well, this is a totally ignorant assumption because,
first of all, Intel is just one of many CPU manufacturers, where is
AMD, where is GPU, do they even know what type of workloads are now
running on what hardware? There are army of these chips, each designed
for its specific purpose. The CPU you can buy at Micro Center is but a
tiny tip of an iceberg, it's a general purpose at best, and even this
I would suspect …&lt;/p&gt;</summary><content type="html">&lt;figure class="col l8 m8 s12"&gt;

for its specific purpose. The CPU you can buy at Micro Center is but a
tiny tip of an iceberg, it's a general purpose at best, and even this
I would suspect that it is not &amp;mdash; every design has a tradeoff,
say performance vs. power consumption, or footprint vs. cost,
therefore it is not &lt;strong&gt;general purpose&lt;/strong&gt; at all in these senses. It can
be called a general purpose to its workload, but only means that it's
&lt;strong&gt;mediocore&lt;/strong&gt; for all workloads, and is not tweaked for any &amp;mdash;
everybody gets 60 out of 100, but forget about a 100/100. Well, then,
I would ask these BS authors, is this really what you are asking for?
is this the state you think that will save this country!? I don't
think you even know what you are talking about.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Not to mention, when we talk about chips, which is a &lt;strong&gt;broad&lt;/strong&gt; word,
like &lt;strong&gt;IT&lt;/strong&gt;, that covers more than one industry, not more than one
company! There are micro controllers (Motorola), DSP (TI), FPGA
(Xilinx), SOC, and god knows how many other such programmable embedded
thing we are actually using daily even in our life &amp;mdash; just look
around, there is microwave oven, refrig, TV remote control, AC, car
radio, your phone, smart watch, now even smart home devices... all
these, are programmed with some software, so that it has a certain
application logic to react to a human input. None of these, is running
on an Intel CPU. So there you have it, I cease my case on CPU.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now, let's look at operating system. Again, the same logic fallacy is
seen here &amp;mdash; there are &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_operating_systems"&gt;an army of operating systems out
there&lt;/a&gt;. If you look up the word "cloud joke", the number one
popular comic is: &lt;strong&gt;"Cloud is mostly made of Linux servers"&lt;/strong&gt;, get it?
China has attempted RedFlag Linux back in 2000, when I was really
impressed by it because it used a Windows-like desktop management UI
so laptop vendors at 中关村 can sell their thing without infringing
Microsoft's IP. At that time it was even bragged that government is to
move to this platform so to become independent from MS &amp;larr; doesn't
this sound familiar now!? &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The difficulty of operating system is not a technical one at all. If
you look the list above, you will be surprised to think how all these
can all work, and many you haven't even heard of &amp;larr; no offense,
let me just ask you this, have you used BSD? or Solaris? ... well,
these are not only in broad use, but is super powerful, and in many
technical ways superior to MS Win. Period. So pls, stop talking about
OS as if you know. You know nothing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If there is one OS you should care about, then it is not MS at
all. Linux is the king on the Internet, and it's open source! So don't
even bother inventing your own, you will be quite impressive if only
you could understand and keep up w/ Linux core itself! RedFlag tried
it, and failed probably, so go for it, it's a lot harder than writing
those BS articles!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Further, the challenge of OS is not even technical, but purely
business &amp;mdash; operating system is responsible to provide a base for
hardware-to-software interface. The key is how compatible an OS is
with gazillion of hardware varieties and vendors out there. Let's say
you have just invented your own super OS, will my PCI audio card work?
and wifi module? and camera? and even memory, some data bus, USB,
bluetooth, when I plug in my USB microphone for gaming, will it be
recognized and work? and my HP printer?.... the list goes on and on
and on. People dont realize, when his/her computer works so
effortlessly that all these peripherals work magically, is the result
of a tremendous collaboration between OS maker and hardware vendors --
hardware vendor will have &lt;strong&gt;no incentive whatsoever&lt;/strong&gt; to write a
driver for your OS unless your OS is popular. Then, alternatively, you
will have to write your own!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So, have you written USB drivers before? are you ready to commit time,
resource, $$ to cover, say 100 hardwares you see in popular laptops?
If even leveraging an existing open source one, such as Linux, has
failed, then I would say it's hard pressed to make me believe you can
pull off without even realizing the task ahead! If we take all these
development as a whole and give it a score of 100, I would say writing
OS is like 10%, or even 5%, while the rest are about making it
compatible with hardware &lt;strong&gt;your OS needs to support&lt;/strong&gt;. That, honestly,
is not only technically hard, but simply impossible business wise! If
only China owns every single hardware piece in that computer, and
enforce these vendors to write code to support your OS, I can best
your OS will flop. Period. And I bet you haven't thought of the risk
if this even became true &amp;mdash; if you build a machine like this,
then you have to drag this entire vertical chain over to keep up with
all these other development industry is rolling out constantly &amp;mdash;
new protocol, new bus strategy, new hardware new software, new data
format, so on and on and on.. you will be left in dust sooner than you
think!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;People, please, stop talking about things you don't know, and
definitely stop dressing it in such a nationalist tone. This doesn't
help to fix the issue. Instead, do your homework, learn your code,
think hard and &lt;strong&gt;pay as much to&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;a href="https://fengxia41103.github.io/myblog/details.html"&gt;details&lt;/a&gt; as possible. This is
the only way to become good, if you are good, and lucky.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Everything else, is just BS.&lt;/p&gt;</content><category term="thoughts"></category><category term="thoughts"></category></entry><entry><title>Details</title><link href="https://fengxia41103.github.io/myblog/details.html" rel="alternate"></link><published>2019-01-11T15:45:00-05:00</published><updated>2019-01-11T15:45:00-05:00</updated><author><name>Feng Xia</name></author><id>tag:fengxia41103.github.io,2019-01-11:/myblog/details.html</id><summary type="html">&lt;figure class="col s12"&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Devils are indeed in details. Watching a Japanese movie &lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I0wv79C0zqc"&gt;Fire on the
Plain&lt;/a&gt;, it suddenly reminded me a topic I have always wanted to
write about &amp;mdash; you know, when we are listening to the wonderful
story of the Three Kingdoms, and fancy how powerful China was, and how
you could also be a hero, neither the author, nor anyone has lived off
these stories, such as nowadays talk show hosts, bother to mention to
you at all, that if there were indeed an army of that size &amp;mdash; a
few hundred thousands, or even millions, how terrible the smell their
camp must have been!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yes. We heard in 评书 of 埋锅造饭, and there are many stories about
how an army can run out of food, and how you can raid your enemy's
food line to arouse a panic. But, no one has described the other end
of the human digest system &amp;mdash; shits! Literally. If you eat, you
shit. They have to come out, somehow, some way, some day. No
exception. As a …&lt;/p&gt;</summary><content type="html">&lt;figure class="col s12"&gt;

how an army can run out of food, and how you can raid your enemy's
food line to arouse a panic. But, no one has described the other end
of the human digest system &amp;mdash; shits! Literally. If you eat, you
shit. They have to come out, somehow, some way, some day. No
exception. As a matter of fact, I would even fancy (well, I'm using
the word "fancy" because myself never had experience of starvation,
thus can only speculate) that holding shit from coming out is more
difficult than enduring a few days of hunger. I can totally see myself
skip a few meals to survive, and even happy (ask Noah and he will
definitely agree), but holding from toilet for a few days!?.... very
unlikely.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So there it is. If I were a general back in those days, I could tell
the size of an army by counting how smelly their camp was. Especially
back then public health was a thing never heard of. My friend in Tibet
is still struggling w/ a resident without a proper toilet to go to, in
21st century, then what's the odds that ancient army has such a
discipline to deal with that!? &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Further, if such knowledge and practice has existed and has been used
in such a massive scale &amp;larr; we are talking about a lot of people,
males mostly, concentrated in a tight space and in a short period of
time, then why not we never heard about anything in books? in talks?
The people, so called fighters, existed with a curious attribute that
they have all the other human features except this one thing! How
wonderful!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Think about it. If they didn't dig toilet, then the camp would be a
massive shit dump! Will the tent next to you care anything about you
stepping onto their shits!? probably not. So everyone takes his path
of lease resistence &amp;mdash; being the most convenient for him, at that
emergency moment, and forget about social etiquete! Then what will
that camp look like? smell like? errrr............&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now someone will say, oh, they have toilet like we do. Then, let's
say how many these facilities they will have!? It has be many many
many, because, when you live w/ even a few thousand people, the ground
it takes to have all these people lie down is quite large. Therefore,
are you going to walk across a few miles just to pee!? Maybe not. So
there must be a facility near you or your group. Well, then this
becomes a math exercise: for an army of 100,000, let's say 100 people
share a toilet, then there needs to be, 1000 toilets! and you know
what, digging those things are not that easy! and what about when you
are marching into a territory in which digging a toilet is not
possible, say, winter in New England!?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Everytime when I watched movie that soldiers are ambushing an enemy by
lying and waiting for hours there, I was always wondering, what if I
need to pee right now? or shit? Pee might be ok. But shit!? I mean, I
can do that, but that smell will give away our position, right!? and
it won't be just me, what if quite a few of my band of brothers had
the same need!? &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Details, details, details. I looked at Vietnam war movies, and saw
American barracks. They make sense. There is toilet. But in China's
grand military stories, no one shits, physically.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is fxxx miracle. &lt;/p&gt;</content><category term="thoughts"></category><category term="thoughts"></category></entry><entry><title>Thank me</title><link href="https://fengxia41103.github.io/myblog/thank%20me.html" rel="alternate"></link><published>2019-01-09T18:55:00-05:00</published><updated>2019-01-09T18:55:00-05:00</updated><author><name>Feng Xia</name></author><id>tag:fengxia41103.github.io,2019-01-09:/myblog/thank me.html</id><summary type="html">&lt;p&gt;This is a curious thing.

&lt;p&gt;This gets me thinking, why? why people care about credits? why such a
comment will make me think more than once? is that because it bothers
me? but then, I couldn't care less what she said in return, or whether
credits go to the young girl who chipped in an advice, which I knew
for sure will not work (because this is not a Snapple bottle, and I'm
sure her experience is from that kind of opener), and hitting lid will
leak air, thus balancing air pressure of the jar, and that's what
makes it possible to open the lid. Well, but I won't, and won't be
able to, explain all these to them. So the woman had no sense of
thanking me for the hard work, and the girl said nothing and took full
credits. Awkward, isn't it?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But why did that happen? and isn't there other moments in life that
this exact same scenario plays? How about someone comments how well
doing your son is, and you are happy, because without saying, you, the
parents, own all the credits? &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But is that so, at all? what about his teacher at school? or his
friend at YMCA? or a butterfly effect that any minute affair can just
change your life, so what you have today, see today, is really an
accumulation of all these little events, encounters, combined!? then
what about credits to these people? Even if you want to send them all
the thanks and appreciations, it is impossible to execute. So these
hidden influencers, will not get any credits. How unfair!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is really strange. But we all know we care about getting a thank
you when you did, or you thought you did, something good. This is
exact the problem of a broken marriage, in which two become out of
sync of who is doing whom a favor, and who owes whom a thank you, or
an apology! Therefore, it's only logical to argue that such
&lt;em&gt;expectation&lt;/em&gt; is built in, that it is only natural for you think and
to expect that way, thus, will be disappointed when it doesn't
happen. In other words, the annoyances, or even hate, is a logical
result of you having such expectation at the first place.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But you don't get to choose not having such built-ins at all. Just
like another thought I realized yesterday &amp;mdash; life is such a
misery, that you don't get to choose its beginning, nor its ending (as
of today), then &lt;strong&gt;it will only be extremely foolish to believe that you
have control over the process in between!&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The truth must be, you don't. So, what is life about? A journey you
are put through, no choice, no option. Then, what's the odds that it
is already written, somewhere, by someone!? Very likely I would say.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;pattern, control&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Then, there is another interesting conversation I picked up the  other
day. A nurse at Taikang was commenting that she "figured out" a
规率 of a patient, and this is common in daily conversations. The
speaker usually showed a face of pride, and it is taken as a positive
comment because it feels we now understand a pattern, and feels we are
now in control &amp;rarr; we can next time manage this, better.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This definitely makes me believe, that seeking a pattern, is another
built-in feature of human &amp;mdash; we are actively looking for
patterns, summarizing in order to formulate a pattern, and without a
pattern, which in my mind is a repeatable process or action, we don't
have management. Period. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But having pattern, or thinking that we have a pattern, gives us a
false sense of being in control! I would simply argue that seeing a
pattern is a clue to figure out a causal effect relationship, but it
does not logically yield better management at all &amp;mdash; and for
being in control, well, I have just said in previous section that we
simply do not have any control. Period.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So, how many of these human built-ins are there, I wonder!? I feel we
know so little about ourselves, that it can leave people like me to
wonder, to 胡说八道, to entertain myself with these words, these
thoughts, and leaving myself a laughing stock for God or anyone else
for that matter.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If only I could even be a joke, so at least it makes someone smile
&amp;larr; wait a minute, then, do I get a "thank you"!??&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Traveling reveals one thing to me. I don't know whether this is unique
to me, or it is common to many people, guys especially. I start to
realize that, regardless which space I am in, let's say, in a shuttle
bus, or a subway, or an airport, or a country like Cambodia, there are
always women, and among them, somehow, there is always one that you
will find attractive, like to look at a few more times. It's a
pleasant feeling, but also feels strange in a social context, that
feels like a pervert. But honestly, it just happens. I step into this
space, observe, start to be aware of people around me, then violla,
over there, there is this one person that you will just realize, that
she is good looking (in sense of relativity of course), and you want
to see more of her.&lt;/p&gt;

really wondering that in a closed space of any kind, human will find a
mate. If so, I would only guess that this is really driven by
instinct, by some native builtin desire.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When was the last time I watched clouds floating by? when was the last
time you watched clouds floating by?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I can't recall it anymore. It felt like a strange memory. Do you know
when you are staring at clouds, you feel it is moving towards you,
becoming larger and larger, and some part of it is always moving,
changing, like 棉絮, how fascinating!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Last night's street food definitely had a toll on both of us. Swimming
a bit helped, but I could still feel the cranking at stomach, and Noah
is taking a nap next by the pool. These traveling young couple decided
to have lunch at the hotel's restaurant. I could smell the perfume
the girl is wearing. Beautiful weather, a bit hot, but beautiful. I
don't think we can ask more from nature for a better life. &lt;/p&gt;

honking! Yes indeed. The whole city, regardless the zillion bikes,
scooters, motorcycles, kids on every kind on every kind of these,
cars, street dogs, chickens... it feels, life, but not noisy. The air
smells burning fire from street food stalls and grocery markets. This
place is poor, but it has a pleasant smell, a relaxing feel. The
girl's fragrance is becoming another string of this city smell.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;How far can smell travel? how long can it last? I know smell can burn
into memory, deep, that I recall walking in Beijing park w/ mom a few
years back when she was showing me those flowers. All of sudden I
recall the smell. You couldn't tell where you had that before, but you
know it. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Clouds are floating by, together, with this fragrance in the air, and
the city bustles in the background. Sun rays over the swimming pool, a
butterfly going anywhere she feels please. When will this happen
again? and when will I recall? &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Went to a coffee shop on the way to scooter rental place this
morning. Both Noah and I didn't feel well. So we stopped this place
for a recharge. It's gift shop is really nice. Got a string bag, just
what I wanted for trip like this! and a wallet made out of rubber
tire, which I thought it was thick leather. How wonderful! I guess it
is from one of the recycle programs that locals make these artifacs,
and sell to support a program. It's good cause I hope. It doesn't
really matter that much. I liked the place, liked the morning walk w/
Noah, liked the small gift shop and the two post cards I picked. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;They are over priced by local standard I'm sure. But I want to leave
something to this country, to this beautiful place, because, it had
given me so much in my first vist, w/ her, and has given me beautiful
clouds and a pleasant smell. She didn't wear perfume. I don't need
that to remind me of everything.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Life is turning a cycle. Landed in Siem Reap w/ Noah last
night. Immigration was at snail speed, reminded me what I have already
forgotten &amp;mdash; perhaps it was just as slow, but w/ her, time flew
by. There were a young Japanese couple on the shuttle bus going from
terminal to the airplane. What a love in the air! How wonderful to see
couples in love, however their lives may play out to be. They are
just, wonderfully, happy. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The country has not changed, and it has changed much. Watching
scooters and motorcycles going by this morning while Noah and I were
sitting at the hotel's breakfast place enjoyin g fancy meal, I think
the people are dressing better, the vehicles look better, and young
staffs are having a fancier hairdo and accessories than I
remembered. I hope this country will do well. It is such a beautiful

must suffer? It's unfair, and I hope there will be their turn.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Everywhere I turn, I see sign of poverty, see sign of their past. Even
in this fancy place, the bamboo curtain hanging on the back this
building look too original to be a decor, and the yard next to where
I'm sitting by this nice looking pool &amp;mdash; wild grasses, bushes,
deserted. I think that must have been what this hotel location used to
look like. Yet, breakfast menu is so westernized, and you can see so
hard they are trying to &lt;em&gt;satisfy their customer&lt;/em&gt;, that it's even sad
that I didn't see much of Cambodia flavors &amp;larr; what do they eat at
home? It can't be the egg bendict w/ coffee! &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Was chatting w/ Taikang staff of western influence the other day. My
point was that you don't need to try hard if other people think what
you do is great &amp;rarr; they will pick up, they will learn. I think
there must be a term of this western influence &amp;larr; maybe it's
called &lt;em&gt;the curse of the western civilization&lt;/em&gt;? It's said that people
are trying to meet western standard in order to show their progress,
their modernization &amp;larr; it's inevitable.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But then, I was watching scooters, bikes, pedestrians, people. "Not
many cars yet. But what will it be when there is?" They would have to
widen the street, which at this moment can form at most a two lane
traffic. One side is this hotel. By the time this needs to be happen,
I would guess the hotel will be doing pretty well. So this is unlikely
to be destroyed. Then what? On the other side of this street, there
are trees, open land, parks &amp;larr; these, will be wiped out, in name
of progress and development. Wouldn't that be sad? The scene that I'm
seeing today, will be no more.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When will she be back to this country, someday? What will she think of
these? or the trip we took together? Will she be sitting by a pool,
giving some thoughts to what I'm thinking? or, maybe the world has
already changed above recognition? I wish I would know, or wish she
would write them down, or tell me, somehow. How much I wish to know
more about her life, the one that is unfolding, the one that she is
destined to live?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I don't know how many more times I would come back to this
country. Too many places and time and moments are now tied w/ memory
of her, that wherever I turn, wherever I go, wherever I will end up to
be, there is always a silhouette, accompanying me.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Noah is by my side working on his homework. Nice breeze. A pleasant

&lt;p&gt;Last day of 2018. Snowed yesterday. Amazingly the snow accumulated
over night, and Shanghai is now looking pretty, covered in white, and
fresh air. Listening to Xmas music in Starbucks, with Noah reading his
comic book next to me. It's quiet. The shop just opened. I thought it
was already opened at 7, but it turned out we were the first
customers. I like it, peaceful and quiet, and holiday in the air. Sent
you a message on the way over. I saw the snow, and that is forever
linked with you. I can see your face brighten up and your prettiness
is captured in someone's camera. Yes, this is what you will like, and
I am happy to imagine how happy you will be.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What more can I ask about life, when I have this type of rather luxury
life, where the person I love, Noah, is next to me, and I am able to
spend some time w/ Dad? Though I don't know …&lt;/p&gt;</summary><content type="html">&lt;figure class="col s12"&gt;

&lt;p&gt;What more can I ask about life, when I have this type of rather luxury
life, where the person I love, Noah, is next to me, and I am able to
spend some time w/ Dad? Though I don't know where you are anymore. At
least, we are in the same city, breathing the same air, seeing the
same snow, and in the same space in a sense that I know you are here,
and maybe, you will think of me, too.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;End of 2018. Another year. I dont' get excited over holidays anymore. I
looked at my camera this morning. Even though I have just bought a
few more lenses, I don't think I'm becoming a good photographer
&amp;mdash; I'm not taking pictures, and I dont' have fire burning inside
me. I don't have an audience in mind for whom I am going to show and
talk about these pictures, experience, and imagine her face, her
smell, her reaction. Without that, I feel nothing but emptiness, a
void. I know you are still there, like living in my soul. Yet, you are
becoming so silent that I'm afraid I will have moments I don't hear
your voice anymore in my mind. Reading the "One Hundred Years of
Solitude", what a tough book! I was constantly reminded of you when
characters were going through life with their burning desire and their
persistent, sometimes even rather strange, love. It's one thing to
live in love, feeling the anxiety, pain, excitement, tingling of skin
at a touch, quite another that each love ended in misery, or not even
having an end, just disappeared into a thin air, like nothing
happened.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;How sad. I feel love is a thing God invented to tease human, that
gives you so much hope, makes you feel so full and fulfilled, will
fade, inevitably, and will change, inevitably. The best one can wish
is to turn it into a family-ish relation, and that's just, sad. What
happened to desire? to sensitivity? to yearning of seeing someone, of
being with someone, of be close to someone, of being known and
understood by someone, being thought of by someone, being reminded by
someone when the weather is cold, or hot, or rain, or shine, or
anything, just to be reminded, that the someone, is there?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I don't know why people can get over these moments so quickly (or so
easily). I really don't get it. These are the moments in life that
made life worth living, it gives you a memory to look back, to feel
yourself deep inside that you are still sensitive to a feeling, even
it is just sad, that you are alive. Moving on is indeed a wicked
word. It is not by anyone's choice. It's a choice by time, and time
goes on without concerning a bit of who you are, what you do, whom you
love.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So, 2018, like any other year, is nothing but an earmark of time,
ruthlessly passing by, announcing its existence, trashing everything
on its path, indifferent, cold-hearted, sensible.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But human, if deserves that name, has feelings, and should cherish
that, because that is all we have left. Like me thinking of you at
this hour, that you probably will never know, nor will you care
perhaphs. But that's all I have, all I have to stare at the face of
time, at the passing of this coldness, so not to be turned into a
being that myself will hate. You, keep me, sane.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I miss you. Go play in the snow. You will like it. You always do, and
that's how I remembered about you, and wish you remember something
about me, too.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;What makes a city? what makes a &lt;strong&gt;good city&lt;/strong&gt;? I wonder.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I start to have a mixed feeling of Shanghai, from love, to dislike, to
annoyed, to now feeling, maybe, I could live here, someday. It is,
tolerable, in a sense that, it is so massive and dynamic, and there is
gotta be a corner for me, and a person for me, just that I need keep
an open mind to it. What made me think this way isn't something of
Shanghai, but I was thinking to live in &lt;a href="https://fengxia41103.github.io/myblog/people watching.html"&gt;Seoul&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But then, it is just another mega metropolitan, another million people
that I do not know, and I had impression of a happy tourist, and a
hope of an opportunist just like a kid wondering into a new candy
shop, a new theme park &amp;mdash; everything is new, everything is
exciting, everything seems possible &amp;larr; even when I am typing this,
the underline assumption is that, everything &lt;strong&gt;good&lt;/strong&gt; is possible! I

wasn't thinking at all that by using the word "everything", well, by
definition, it includes both good and bad, doesn't it?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;How biased human is! How self-centered one naturally is! and how
optimistic one is without a reason! I think this is indeed human
nature, at least it says a lot about myself than anything else I say
and do.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I like watching people, like watching them walk in Starbucks in the
morning, on their way to work or just to hang out. Time is indeed a
luxury that many have, but few cherish. Many fancy office ladies came
in for their morning drink, I don't know whether their body is used to
a coffee in the morning, or it is only a psychological need, be it an
accessory to her dress of the day, or her feeling of herself, or a
step in her daily routine. Any, and all, I suppose.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Doesn't matter. Everyone is going through 24 hours, somehow, someway,
no more, and no less. I was thinking, what makes being young, so
desirable, so naturally beautiful? Is it an endless possibility?
energy? fine skin? flush hair? beautiful boyfriend/girlfriend?
... Actually, I feel none of the above. If there is one word, I think
it is &lt;strong&gt;care free&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This word has many times popped to my head recently, care free. Yes, I
think it is exactly what American were giving the world of being cool,
being, American &amp;rarr; care free. This is what nobles and old moneys
feel superior to others, not because they have many rules to observe,
which they do and they are baked in their body and mind. Yet, it's the
gesture of being care free, the atmosphere of a care free mind, like
the Western cowboys, like a dare devil who adventure, that is
charming, is mysterious, is interesting.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Time, is universal to everyone. Care free, is hardly available, to
anyone. The burden of middle age is exactly the opposite to being care
free, and that's why it feels sooooo, tiresome, so depressing, so
little with hope and excitement, and you need to amass courage to
battle, to counter, to stay afloat. Kids are wonderful, because they
are genuinely care free &amp;larr; honestly, they don't care. Adults, if
being care free, is either terrible person who is rude, insensitive,
and bogus, or is really great because s/he has a free soul.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I don't know which extreme I am at. I'm flattering myself even to
guess this, because I'm neither &amp;mdash; me, like zillion others, is
living in between, between care frees, yearning for it, but we can not
be. This may sound like a cliche, typical middle age crisis, poor guy.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But there are many other forms, how about being care free and still
not cool? being not care free and not responsible at the same time? I
am trying hard to keep a free mind, to keep that part care free, yet I
need to fulfill responsibilities of family, as I have promised to Lei,
and it is part of me, like integrity &amp;mdash; I will do what is right,
whether anyone watches or not. But indeed, I have witnessed many, who
lost touch w/ themselves, who walk around without being responsible,
without feeling guilty about it, and making care free a gesture, not a
nature, and that's really, annoying, because what they display is the
exact opposite of being care free &amp;mdash; they care so much of what
others say, and they lost themselves in others' eyes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So, what makes a city? what makes a good city? I wonder. City is a
mass of people. I think it's the people, the people that makes a city
charming. And a city full of care free people, will be the wild wild
west... No. Care free is not a label you can tell. It's a feeling you
can sense, like chatting with a stranger, with a friend, you can tell,
what type of person s/he is...like this guy sitting on this table,
across to him is, what, his mom? his lover? I don't know.. but he is
really annoying, really really rude, and he display a gesture of,
terrible personality, yet he might think he is cool. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Well, so if you encounter, in a random way, more of care free people
in your way, than usual, I would say, that is a city, that is a good
city. By this standard, I have to say, Shanghai, is far from it
&amp;mdash; there is one person this mega city I care to know, care to
think, and feel pleasant with. She is care free, and I wish her that
way, forever, and ever.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Please, 美丽的人, be care free.&lt;/p&gt;</content><category term="thoughts"></category><category term="love"></category></entry><entry><title>Mobs</title><link href="https://fengxia41103.github.io/myblog/mobs.html" rel="alternate"></link><published>2018-12-19T07:55:00-05:00</published><updated>2018-12-19T07:55:00-05:00</updated><author><name>Feng Xia</name></author><id>tag:fengxia41103.github.io,2018-12-19:/myblog/mobs.html</id><summary type="html">&lt;figure class="col s12"&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The news of Ofo is really a good one. I wonder when human (well, human
is really a big word, because this is generalizing to all the walking
lives on this planent, so I should really refine this statement to,
well, people? mass?..) will learn. Really, let's use the word,
&lt;strong&gt;they&lt;/strong&gt;, will learn!?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is a demonstration of the old, repeated, disaster, for both
sides &amp;mdash; as consumers, the mass, when they would learn not to
take what these elites say for granted!? when can they think for
themselves whether the thing in fad is really, a good thing? I have to
again repeat the discussion I had with family and friends 2 years
ago, when Ofo and its cousins were the darling of the media, and
everyone was essentially saying that if you don't understand and not
yet be part of this wave of &lt;a href="https://fengxia41103.github.io/myblog/sharing economy.html"&gt;sharing economy&lt;/a&gt;, you are out, old,
obsolete. I questioned many why they think this was a good thing, and

obsolete. I questioned many why they think this was a good thing, and
honestly no one was able to explain to me in their own voice. The only
message I got were either quotes quotes that were the same all over
from one to another, making me wonder whether they were literally
copying each other!?, and that it was good because it was convenient,
for someone &amp;mdash; but then, the funny thing is, no one can well
define this "someone"!? who are they? how many are they? why is it
convenient for them? why this convenience didn't work for others? and
if it is that good, then something terribly bad must also be there,
what is it? I mean, even in its simpliest term, if one group of people
benefit so much from this while others were left out, there is a
social implication, which, if is the negative side of this wave, is
itself deserving study and question. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But the sad reality was, no one, literally no one, voiced a different
opinion! This, is the true tragedy of this fiasco. I will repeat here,
&lt;strong&gt;if you don't hear a different opinion on something, then it is
terribly wrong! stay away from it!&lt;/strong&gt; I don't know how people will feel
when they flip back to those talk shows when the CEOs of these
companies were invited to talk about their GRAND idea, and their
&lt;em&gt;dreams&lt;/em&gt;, and their &lt;em&gt;success&lt;/em&gt; &amp;mdash; I truly believe they had a good
capability, ambition, and the least, a willingness to dream big, and
was able to pull it off, even for five minutes, of his/her glory
&amp;mdash; this is better than, me. Not only I admit this, but I envy
this, and totally think they were successful people, in that regard.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What disappointed me was that while they were standing at the height
of where they were, they had a scope and opportunity to view and judge
with much more inside information than I could, yet they did not show
the capability, or even the willingness, to review, to challenge the
exact same idea that had brought them this glory, thus was absorbed by
it and taken in by its own halo, and eventually were taken by its
collapse. Too many parallel can be drawn between these stories &amp;mdash;
what about &lt;a href="https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0441773/"&gt;Kung Fu Panda&lt;/a&gt;, that Shifu's pet student turned out to
be a monster, because Shifu was blinded by his love to his prodigy?
Too many such stories! Yet, human, yes, human, don't learn.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Then, on the flip side, mobs. If these proud entrepreneurs can have
one thing to take away, they should now see the motion of the mobs
&amp;mdash; they were blindly led to believe in your story, and when it
collapses, it will be naive to ask them to be &lt;strong&gt;rational&lt;/strong&gt; so they
don't just come to your door, with their anger (&lt;strong&gt;and they felt
extremely justified, and logically so, just as they felt extremely
convinced by your shaky story at the beginning, too&lt;/strong&gt;), to smash your
windows, trashes your offices, insults yourself and whoever on their
way, and &lt;strong&gt;demanding for justice, when themselves were violating the
exact word, justice, with what they were doing&lt;/strong&gt;!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is the power of the mobs. The underline assumption is literally
this &amp;mdash; &lt;strong&gt;we were never wrong&lt;/strong&gt;. When I believed in you, I was
led to believe. I was innocent, defendless, and pure minded. I
benefited, but you benefit more. Didn't you walk away w/ millions,
billions, while I only got a &lt;strong&gt;deserved convenience&lt;/strong&gt; (of riding a
free bike)? Didn't I made you the billionaire? Everything you had was
because of, me, me me! Thus, when I am now angry (because I felt I was
cheated), I am simply taking away what I had given you, the piece that
was belong to me, and (who knows, maybe can walk away w/ something
more &amp;mdash; what an opportunist animal mobs really are!) &amp;mdash; but
again, let me make sure, that I'm the victim, I have always been
innocent, and I have never been wrong.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;How ugly! How ridiculous this logic really is! Mobs. In this sense,
entrepreneurs do deserve a big paycheck, because they are playing w/
fire. They are 火中取栗, and they can be burned, big time.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I recall seeing the &lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u-FlWZ1BOcA"&gt;facebook congress hearing&lt;/a&gt;. You know, I like
this guy &amp;mdash; he has a lot of reflection on his success, on his
business, and on how his darling is changing human life. This, is what
I would call the responsibility of an entrepreneur &amp;mdash; it's not
only the responsibility to build a good, healthy environment for
his/her employee because there are many families in the background
whose lives are now depending on his actions, but more importantly,
&lt;strong&gt;a responsibility to reflect, to review, to ask a loads of questions,
of why his has been successful, and how it can go wrong, and what
price someone is paying for his/her benefit&lt;/strong&gt;!?? &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We all know the principle that there is no free lunch. Exactly. There
isn't. When you are benefiting from one seemingly such a wonderful
thing, be it an APP, or the quality of life by industrialization,
urbanization, machine age, information wave.... the terms don't
matter, let's just use the cliche name, &lt;strong&gt;progress&lt;/strong&gt;... then, what are
we giving up for it? Few can answer this question, even fewer care to
ask. Same for myself. When I came to America, I knew my life would be
a better one than staying behind (at that time of the century). The
family knew we gave up a safety net of caring for parents when they
need us, and I experienced the pain of long distance love over and
over. If these are the price to pay, then it is not a clear cut for
anyone, for myself in particular, whether the price equals the gain
&amp;mdash; like anyone else, we want to have the gains, but not the
pains. Sadly, &lt;strong&gt;it never work that way, for anyone&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Sign of mobs are, that they are easily &lt;strong&gt;convinced&lt;/strong&gt; to judge one good
and the other bad, and they don't question &lt;strong&gt;enough&lt;/strong&gt;. If there is one
sign we should look for, to foster, to hope, so that the aggregation
of mobs(= society) is a becoming better, is that there are many many
many many different voices who argue, who fight, who disagree, who
challenge, who is not convinced, who always feel the others' decision
is, questionable..... that, will be a good sign, that the people are now,
smarter, and safer, to deal with.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The common mistake to make, is that you like to fool foolish people,
and feel awesome that your tricks work out so well... that is only
when, the fools haven't turned on you. &lt;strong&gt;Fools, are, fools. If they
can love you foolishly, they will leave you, in a foolish way,
too. Engaging them, as partner or as a opponent, is making a fool of
yourself.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</content><category term="thoughts"></category><category term="thoughts"></category></entry><entry><title>Human intelligence</title><link href="https://fengxia41103.github.io/myblog/human%20intellignece.html" rel="alternate"></link><published>2018-12-13T19:19:00-05:00</published><updated>2018-12-13T19:19:00-05:00</updated><author><name>Feng Xia</name></author><id>tag:fengxia41103.github.io,2018-12-13:/myblog/human intellignece.html</id><summary type="html">&lt;figure class="col l8 m8 s12 right"&gt;

&lt;p&gt;What in incredible &lt;a href="http://dougengelbart.org/content/view/138/000/"&gt;paper&lt;/a&gt;! This says so much computer and
artificial intelligence than any of the popular talks. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Every process of thought or action is made up of sub-processes. Let us
consider such examples as making a pencil stroke, writing a letter of
the alphabet, or making a plan. Quite a few discrete muscle movements
are organized into the making of a pencil stroke; similarly, making
particular pencil strokes and making a plan for a letter are complex
processes in themselves that become sub-processes to the over-all
writing of an alphabetic character.  2a8&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Although every sub-process is a process in its own right, in that it
consists of further sub-processes, there seems to be no point here in
looking for the ultimate bottom of the process-hierarchical
structure. There seems to be no way of telling whether or not the
apparent bottoms (processes that cannot be further subdivided) exist
in the physical world or in the limitations of human understanding.

&lt;p&gt;In any case, it is not necessary to begin from the bottom in
discussing particular process hierarchies. No person uses a process
that is completely unique every time he tackles something
new. Instead, he begins from a group of basic sensory-mental-motor
process capabilities, and adds to these certain of the process
capabilities of his artifacts. There are only a finite number of such
basic human and artifact capabilities from which to draw. Furthermore,
even quite different higher order processes may have in common
relatively high-order sub-processes."
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I have had a few conversations w/ people who are not computer workers,
for example, the girl who is taking care of my Dad. I have always
found it difficult to demonstrate the value of computer, and at the
same time annoyed by elites who brag about the &lt;strong&gt;future without
understanding or even giving much thoughts to the complexity of their
empty promise, and the implication, especially social ones, that a new
way of doing things can bring&lt;/strong&gt;. I will refine this further that there
are too much attention given to the positive side of a change, which
is exciting, both financially and socially, and too little to view it
from a structure that, for example, presented in this paper, that
guides to understand in which area/domain this change belongs to, how
and why it can an impact, who is a first-degree neighbour thus be
affected, and in what way.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Structure, framework. I have always been advocating that in order to
approach an issue, however complex (or simplistic) it is, to have a
framework in place (and it can be completely subjective and incorrect)
is better than none. Framework is essentially of personal view of the
issue. It is not an arbitrary mark you throw on the wall and call it a
structure. Rather, it is a fruit of deep thinking based on that
person's experience, intelligence, and view of the world even. It is
actually a summary of the all the information presented at the time
and were understood by this person, and is thus an aggregation of
information in shape of a design. If you think about it, everyone is
an architect &amp;mdash; we all operate this way (just like this paper is
presenting), that we use our sensory system to collect information,
which by nature will only be a subset of ALL, and then even a smaller
portion of these collected info will be comprehensive to us, and
translated into a place in an overall hiearchy, which formulates a
reason that explains the info &amp;larr; this is the info process, and
potentially triggers a motivation that leads to action.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Therefore, it is only natural that one has a framework, even
implicitly, because one must have one to operate. Yet, the ability to
recognize your own framework, and be able or willing to present it, is
the difference. This probably can be argued as how much one
understands oneself. Self-reflection brings not only a peace of mind, but a
depressing view of oneself &amp;mdash; how limited one is! how
un-intelligent one is! But intelligence don't change unless one sees
where it is (otherwise, one doesn't even have a reference to compare
to, thus will know no improvement nor degradation). Thus, to define
and present one's view, is a bold move, which shows in affirmative
statements. But this is different from those emotion driven
entrepreneurs, who lack the ability to think, but have too much
ability to fool.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If we then ask ourselves where that intelligence is embodied, we are
forced to concede that it is elusively distributed throughout a
hierarchy of functional processes—a hierarchy whose foundation extends
down into natural processes below the depth of our comprehension. If
there is any one thing upon which this 'intelligence depends' it would
seem to be &lt;strong&gt;organization&lt;/strong&gt;.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If it were so very easy to look things up, how would our vocabulary
develop, how would our habits of exploring the intellectual domains of
others shift, how might the sophistication of practical organization
mature (if each person can so quickly and easily look up applicable
rules), how would our education system change to take advantage of
this new external symbol-manipulation capability of students and
teachers (and administrators)?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Traveling is indeed relaxing. I think I know why &amp;rarr; first of all,
you don't have the daily chore to deal with, no daily routine, no
daily worries, no family, no kids, no work. Second, in a new place, it
always spells opportunity, unknown, as if everything is now possible
&amp;rarr; new encounter, new face, new soul mate just around the corner.
People don't know you, you don't know them. Somehow, they all look,
nice, kind, smiling at you. Especially when you are in a new country,
new language feels so exotic, you don't know what they are saying, but
they all sound really, cute, don't they!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Then, there is, people watching. How fascinating! The thing I like to
do the most on a trip is, people watching. Just like now, sitting by a
bay this beautiful window by a sidewalk in Seoul, snowing a bit this

you feel, superior, that you are looking at them as if God is looking
at our earthings, how much pity he has for us then?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The other day while walking pointlessly in Seoul, I ran into this
nice 3-story Starbucks sitting in the middle of a triangle
square. Went up the 3rd floor for a coffee break, perfect location to
watch people in and out the fancy glass buildings surrounding all
around. What do they do? what is their life like? do they have a love?
and are they happy? are they married? or about to get married? are
they dating? or in the middle of divorce? ..... oh, this massive loaf
of cinnamon bread I ordered this morning!!!... too much food!!... even
though it is really really good!!!... you know, life can't be better
than this &amp;mdash; sitting by a warm AC, next to a big winder, no one
else but a low hum of air conditioner, flashing xmas tree and light,
holiday is in the air, cold outside, a BIG mug of hot coffee, no
agenda, no plan, just to kill time, to feel life, as it can be &amp;mdash;
life, is indeed, a beautiful thing. I had moments when I felt life was
hopeless, not worth living anymore. Then, as of this moment, I think I
would regret if I am about to die. There is a side of life that is
vain, ugly, disgusting, harsh, unpleasant. Then, there is this side,
peaceful, quiet, everything falls into its place, no rush, you can
slow down, you can sit here in the morning, typing things on your
mind, thinking about the person you want to think of, how far apart
you have grown, where she is, what she is doing, how well she is
today, does she also have a moment like this today, a cup of coffee
for breakfast, and how much you wished she would be here, sitting
across this table, having a conversation, even to talk about the daily
headache you two have to solve today, it's ok, just be here, be
here. How I wish you were, here!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is such an unexpected trip. Without connecting w/ Seokhwan for
years, all of sudden he popped up in the map, and I decided when and
then that I'm coming to see him, to see his city, his country, and to
give myself a break. I don't know what to expect, and honestly, I
don't really care. Just go somewhere, and have an alone time, is
good. But what a wonderful place this is!!! I constantly think of the
word, 苦寒之地, which must have been in the old days. But then, I have
to say, their king back then picked a GREAT spot to set up this city,
and the city has become really a nice looking place.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So are their people, good looking &amp;mdash; boys, girls, men, women,
they all walk in style, though not yet as exquisite as the Japanese,
but quite close. Girls all have perfect makeups on (well I guess they
are perfect, cause I couldn't tell the difference otherwise), and have
&lt;strong&gt;really beautiful hair&lt;/strong&gt;. They are not all stars, but they take good
care of themselves, and that matters. Girls, women, really, should be
just responsible to be beautiful, to make this society look nice, to
make human life feel, nice. Let men do all the hard work, but enjoy a
scene of beautiful sight, wherever you turn, you feel the sense of
beauty, the sense of what life can produce, can make, can
give. Wouldn't that be a rare gift already! I know there will be
feminists who say that women are more than their body, their look, but
also they have brains. Totally agree, but they underestimate how hard
it is to become elegant, to act elegant, to be a perpetual beauty, not
just when you are young and beautiful by nature, but be that way when
you grow, when you age, when you mature &amp;larr; honestly, I think it
takes not only hard work, but wisdom &amp;rarr; Excel, Powerpoint, MBA,
any of these, you can learn from book and school, but being an elegant
person in life, to have the inner touch that reflects to the outside
world, to warm up the person near you, to &lt;em&gt;lift hearts&lt;/em&gt; that are down,
that, takes talents, takes courage, takes a wonderful mind, to achieve
that.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Noah really liked the movie &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wonder_(film)"&gt;Wonder&lt;/a&gt;. It was an ok story, too easy
for me to predict its line and its ending. Yet, the climax when he was
awarded his school's yearly achievement, was nice, when the principal
said "whose strength carries up the most hearts by the attraction of
his own". Yes, if only she knows, if only I could keep telling her
this &amp;mdash; you have a heart of gold, you have such a kindness and
inner beauty. Not only you are pretty, but you have brought warmth to
everyone around you, that is, wonder, that is why I miss you so much,
and I care about you so much. I wish the coldness of this world will
never get to you, will never let you down. I wished that I would be
there to shield you from all the bad things that can come your way,
but I'm weak and old, and I wouldn't be able to accompany you long
before you would have to face these yourself. For that, I think the
best is to let you go, so you can find someone near your age, so that
he could be there for you, to grow old with you, to protect you the
longest possible time. I don't know whether you understand this. I
think someday you will, if you happen to read this, somehow. As smart
as you are, I know you would.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So my dear sunshine, my 遥远的美丽的人, at this 苦寒之地, I am missing
you. How much you would have loved this snow! I can see your face
brighten up, reaching out to hold a snow flake, as if you were a kid
again. Yes, so this is a perfect day for this trip, snow, snow,,
millions of them coming down, remind me Boston, a place I miss, and
you, a person I miss.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;早安.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;PS. Just realized, this coffee shop is called &lt;em&gt;I'm Home&lt;/em&gt;. Life indeed

&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It is quite an  unexpected book.... wow, while looking up its book
name, it turned out that it is actually called &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/Romance-Tibet-Chinese-Chen-QuZhen/dp/7223011173"&gt;A Romance in
Tibet&lt;/a&gt;, wow! I was making up this blog's name without knowing the
books is called a romance... what a coincidence!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But indeed, this is a romance, and quite a sad book. When the
airbnb host recommended it to me, I was like, ok, sure I'll read it,
but well, maybe. The first few pages were actually quite not getting
it. But that's how it turned out, that getting up 3 in the morning due
to jetlag, I got nothing else to read but this book, and what a sad
story it turned out.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You know, these days somehow I do feel there is something like a fate,
like an invisible hand that is guiding my readings. I came up with
these random books here and there, and for some reason their contents
will converge, will echo during the days I was living, and made me
wonder whether they were all put …&lt;/p&gt;</summary><content type="html">&lt;figure class="col l5 m5 s12"&gt;

these random books here and there, and for some reason their contents
will converge, will echo during the days I was living, and made me
wonder whether they were all put in my path by someone so I would have
read them in that order one by one, and gradually formulate my
thoughts so I think the way I think, and behave the way I do. Is that
so? Or, maybe it's the other way around, that the way I think and look
at this world make them interest to me, but not on other kinds?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I don't know. While reading it, I couldn't help to think of the book
written by Siqi's grandfather, also a narrative of his days in Tibet,
some sixty years later than this. Not that there were much in common,
but it made me to think of her, again. I wish there were time I could
see her again, and I wonder how her hometown is like &amp;mdash; is it
also lying near these places in the book? and how that would have
shaped her ways, her views? I wish to know, but I guess I will never
have the chance to know anymore. This, makes me sad.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I thought of regrets in life, a lot, these days. Not that I have many
of them to brag and to lament. Yesterday while walking in the rain and
with all the neon lights reflected off a watery street, I suddenly had
a feeling that life is so hard, so hopeless, so not fun without her,
that death is indeed a relief, for me. I know it's the depression
talk. My life is actually not bad, comparing to anyone's, and I'm not
bad, comparing to anyone's. As a matter of fact, I should say that my
life is quite comfortable, nice, healthy, and so on... yet, all these
mean little to me, when my heart is empty, lacking a voice inside to
speak to, a person to think of, a love to give and to receive.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So that's the magic of romance. Watching people walking in this
massive metropolitan, I can't help asking how they go about their
life, if they also don't have a luxury of romance? Do they care, or
don't they? and how can they not to, by their own choice, or just by
nature of theirs? I want to know. I want to know how they can reason
with themselves so their life can go on, so that maybe I can check
myself from falling? But deep inside I also know, that even if they
bother to describe theirs to me, I would not take it in &amp;larr; I
would have then argued that theirs is just, theirs, and that has no
reference to mine, besides, mine will turn out to be quite superior
to, most of them, for sure. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;How ironic! Now I sound like my mom, who is never satisfied w/ what
she has, and how much I have despised that!....I don't know. I'm just
getting old, I guess, so I am approaching, like a proximity curve, to
my parent's way, infinitely approximating, but will never touch. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But then, there is romance, that always touches my soul, however
remote it had been, is always beautiful, makes me sad, makes me
wonder. Two souls connect, endure, and be apart &amp;mdash; death is not
the end, if it breaks a love, because that love becomes, eternal.&lt;/p&gt;</content><category term="thoughts"></category><category term="thoughts"></category></entry><entry><title>Fate</title><link href="https://fengxia41103.github.io/myblog/fate.html" rel="alternate"></link><published>2018-12-05T19:01:00-05:00</published><updated>2018-12-05T19:01:00-05:00</updated><author><name>Feng Xia</name></author><id>tag:fengxia41103.github.io,2018-12-05:/myblog/fate.html</id><summary type="html">&lt;figure class="col s12"&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Another raining winter day. Walking out from airbnb, ran into an old
man carrying a garbage bag, a rain coat with a big cut open on the
back. What caught my attention was his black sneakers &amp;mdash; washed
clean by the rain, but felt soaking wet. He was walking with is right
arm swaying in a strange way while his left hand carrying that
bag.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Walking by him, I put umbrella over him, "您好, 我给您打点儿伞吧" "不
用不用" so he answered. But I put umbrella over him and he didn't
resist. "我听您口音也是这边儿的人那" "我大学毕业就留在这儿了...."
didn't catch the rest of his words, then he went across to the other
side of the residence area, I guess it's his job then to keep the area
clean. I watched him went across, but feeling really sad.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So he graduated from college. By looking at him, he would be about …&lt;/p&gt;</summary><content type="html">&lt;figure class="col s12"&gt;

clean. I watched him went across, but feeling really sad.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So he graduated from college. By looking at him, he would be about the
same as my Dad, slightly younger maybe, but in that generation. And
you know, college graduates in those days were, &lt;strong&gt; rare&lt;/strong&gt;! Not sure
what he said is actually true, but then, what's the motivation for him
to tell me otherwise. It doesn't matter. Watching him, I'm just
wondering how one's fate can play out, for better, and for worse.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What is the hand God is dealing me with? I don't know. These days I'm
pretty bothered by losing hair on the back, not much, but still, makes
me upset and uncomfortable. Maybe it has always been there, but well,
it's catching on my mind these days, and I don't really like it. I
think what really bothers me is the irreversible sign of aging. There
are plenty young people walking around in this city, looking good,
healthy, energetic... and here I am, stepping into mid age, and soon
will be categorized as being old, and no one would bother to look at
and to pay attention anymore... and that, is just sad.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Sometimes I wonder, is this really bad? I mean, the perfect
combination will be having the young age, and the experience of what I
have today, and probably also the assets, like the Brookline condo,
and the type of confidence at work, that I have today... if only we
could have them all! But well, no one's life is, perfect, though many
look great, by others' standard, or imagination. Up to this age I
think it is safe to say that you will be willing to swap your life
with no one's &amp;mdash; everyone has a mess in life that s/he is having
a headache to deal with, just that you don't know, until you are close
enough with that person, and his/hers problem becomes, yours, like
caring for aging parents, like caring for young kids, like education,
like career, or health, or old boyfriend girlfriend... you just dont'
know, until you have to deal with.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It's hard. I wonder whether this old man has ever wondered that his
fate will land him at this spot, cleaning up this area in a winter
rain... when I went to the Asian Art Museum at San Fransico, the
exhibit of young immigrants and their parents a few generations back,
all the young men, young women, were sooooo good looking, so
beatufiul! So each person, when s/he was young, was at that age, were
just, beautiful.. and this man, when he was at his college, how proud
he would have been, how much hope he would have had, how wonderful his
future life would have been looked like to him.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So, what is fate? an ever unknown path that takes you somewhere,
somewhere you will only be, at the end, and looking back, and with
regret and sorrow, and with joy and agony, with tears that long have
been shed, with person long have been lost, with a true love one must
have had.. how sad how sad! Is this because of aging, that I'm feeling
so permisistic about life? I guess so, it must be.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But then, when looking back in another 20 some years (and how long
that actually is, 20 some years!!! That's like, a long time!! Yet, as
if being discounted from life, from 45 to 70 becomes, feels, is
regarded, as an instance, the same bucket of so called, old, how
unfair!), I would then wish that I could only come back to this age,
at 45, sitting here, should be full of hope, full of life, full of
possibilities, full of love.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What will be it be? My fate?&lt;/p&gt;</content><category term="thoughts"></category><category term="thoughts"></category></entry><entry><title>Memory</title><link href="https://fengxia41103.github.io/myblog/memory.html" rel="alternate"></link><published>2018-12-05T08:30:00-05:00</published><updated>2018-12-05T08:30:00-05:00</updated><author><name>Feng Xia</name></author><id>tag:fengxia41103.github.io,2018-12-05:/myblog/memory.html</id><summary type="html">&lt;figure class="col l8 m8 s12"&gt;

&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Walking on the road this morning. Chilly early winter day. Rained for
the last two days (or really just on and off of yesterday), and
temperature has dropped to the point that I feel the winter smell.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What makes you sad? and makes you wonder? what makes you to have
thoughts? to feel like writing something? to miss someone? to talk to,
if, anyone? to look at the passing bys, taking interest of what they,
where they are going, or what their life is like?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I don't know. This is indeed a strange city. Maybe taking a walk in
the morning does give you more to think about, to feel about, and to
have something to talk about. Sitting here at Starbucks early morning,
while everybody rushes in and out to get their dose, and xmas song in
the background, should I feel tied to home, where they are looking
forward to the upcoming holiday? But I can't feel that at all. This
empty table, like this empty space, is only giving a replay of …&lt;/p&gt;</summary><content type="html">&lt;figure class="col l8 m8 s12"&gt;

mornings we were sitting together, also at Starbucks, sometimes
chatting, sometimes just sitting there. Not much to say, but much to
save.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So that is memory. What a terrible thing it is! Can a person be called
a person if s/he does not have memory anymore? Dad is like that. He
has lost a lot of things. You can still say that he has memory, some
arbitrary, arcane ones that even hard for me to understand and to
follow. Yet, the type of memory that lingers in my mind, to remind me
of you, is the best of me, is the worst of my day.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Why there are so many shadows that will not go away? Even this isn't
the one we spent time at, it's the, I don't know, not even the smell,
cause this shop doesn't have any coffee smell at all. So what is it?
The lighting? the hour of the day? the empty chair across to mine? or
maybe, it's nothing of these, but only, because, you still occupy a
spot in my heart, in my mind, front row, center, the only audience I
care to please, care to look at, care to feel.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And here I am, a one man show, staged in what they call life. It has
way passed its prime, but for what it is still left, I am here,
playing the play, just for you.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Wherever you are, and whenever you read this. This is a lonely,
strange winter morning in Shanghai, a city that only makes me feel
tolerable, because it has, or it may have, you.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Why? for some reason, I can always feel your existence, somewhere,
around the corner, in this city. Walking on the street in this massive
metropolitan, what's the odds that I could ever meet you again? Yet, I
can't shake the feeling that you are somewhere, somewhere really
close, somewhere I'm scared to look at, to look for.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Are you here? You must be. The rain, the endless winter drizzle, damp,
humid, chilly, not yet cold, and wind picks up, sometimes it makes you
shiver, sometimes it makes it feel like a early spring breeze. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I watched Lost In Translation again last night. Jet lagged, awake 11
at night, so I listened to it, and did some work. I felt really sad
when the guy said, "but I dont want to leave".. "then don't, we will
start a Jazz band".... it's sad, isn't it? How can I put it? I don't
want to leave. Yet, I can't be an anchor for you anymore to make your
life standing still. I'm not good enough for the glamour …&lt;/p&gt;</summary><content type="html">&lt;figure class="col l8 m8 s12"&gt;

want to leave. Yet, I can't be an anchor for you anymore to make your
life standing still. I'm not good enough for the glamour and
perfection of you, as much as I would like to convince myself that I
could take care of you till I die, I will, but I can't make you go
through this, the life that I'm being through &amp;larr; it's not fun,
it's a matter of fact, that I have to take care, have to deal with,
have to figure out. But you, you have full life ahead of you. You
should be trouble free, worry free, burden free, just fly, fly w/ all
you want, fly high, fly w/o being dragged down.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I want you to have this life, not a gift of any kind, but what you
deserve, and what you should have. That's a young life I can't give
you. Though with endless 不舍, I have to let you go on.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But you are everywhere. Watched those Japanese movies on the flight,
one after another, I found you in it &amp;mdash; they all looked like
you. I don't know why. Maybe it's just because they, as being
actresses in a movie, are all good looking, and that is certainly
you. But there is more to it. I can't describe, it's just that
everywhere I turn, I find you, a trace of you, somewhere, on
somebody. It's just there, amazingly, there.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What a person you are! and How much I am missing you! Every step I
take, every turn I make, everything incidence that triggers me a
thought, it's always you, who is there, on my mind, that I speak to,
and wished you were here, next to me, belong to me.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;How wonderful the days you have given me! I will never forget, till
the day I die. If marriage will ruin a relationship, then don't, don't
marry, cause love is such a beautiful thing, that it deserves a chance
to live, to last longer, to be forever, to be always sweet, and never
fade.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Maybe, that is called, missing you.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yes, I'm missing you. In this massive metropolitan, I miss, you.&lt;/p&gt;</content><category term="thoughts"></category><category term="love"></category></entry><entry><title>Bad words</title><link href="https://fengxia41103.github.io/myblog/bad%20words.html" rel="alternate"></link><published>2018-11-16T10:37:00-05:00</published><updated>2018-11-16T10:37:00-05:00</updated><author><name>Feng Xia</name></author><id>tag:fengxia41103.github.io,2018-11-16:/myblog/bad words.html</id><summary type="html">&lt;figure class="col l6 m6 s12"&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So Noah's school called yesterday. During lunch the kids at his table
played truth or dare. Noah dared, a girl, to &lt;code&gt;rape&lt;/code&gt;..... geee.. I was
totally speechless and didn't even understand where he could have
picked up that concept. Teacher said she felt this is a topic she
should leave to parents to talk him about... so he and I had a talk on
the way to Kumon.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The good things is that he admitted he said so, not like before that
he would try to get out of it by denying or finding other excuses
like "but the other kid started it". So where did he get that idea? He
said I told him that!!.. what!? How? where? .. "you remember the movie
we watched yesterday?" "which movie!?" "The Japanese samurai movie."
"Samurai movie?.... oh, you mean, the one in which that guy killed
someone for a girl, and he then attacked that girl?...." "yes"&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Oh mine mine.... so he is referring to this movie &amp;mdash; &lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MdIm_i5vAzU"&gt;Satan's

&lt;p&gt;Oh mine mine.... so he is referring to this movie &amp;mdash; &lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MdIm_i5vAzU"&gt;Satan's
Sword: The Dragon God (1960)- Raizō Ichikawa&lt;/a&gt;, in which a young
Samurai was traveling, and met a girl who fell in love with him. She
had a pursuer who was rather a psycho. He hired a rouge who owned a
gun to ambush this samurai on his way, and abducted her to a
hideout. The rouge, however, wanted to attacked the girl. By being
still in &lt;em&gt;love&lt;/em&gt; with her, well, that was the intention to begin with,
right, so he got in a fight with this rouge, and ended up killing. The
girl tried to run away when they were fighting, but failed to
escape. He then &lt;em&gt;sexually assaulted&lt;/em&gt; her, and that's when I presumably
told Noah about "rape".. actually I asked him what this word means,
and he said it means "sexually assault". "Well, then, is it good or
bad?" "Bad." "Correct, any assault is bad, sexually assault is
especially bad."&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But what got me thinking, is that out of the entire movie of so many
good things one can learn &amp;mdash; bravery, loyalty, love, courage,
nobility, aesthetic, curiosity of what a daily life was like back in
12th century Japan... out of all these, one thing he learned, and came
to him mind, was this, "rape"!... how could this be!!!? why!?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You know. See, everyone grows up eventually, everyone learns about
concept of these words, eventually. There is no denial that somehow
one figures it out, same as sexual education, same probably for
anything else, life in general, that you will learn the truth of life,
truth of reality, and how pleasant and unpleasant it actually is, and
what is important, and what is just flashy and superficial.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Therefore, one needs to know about these bad words, and it is
unrealistic to expect one knows how to use it &lt;strong&gt;properly&lt;/strong&gt; on day 1 as
soon as one learned about it, isn't it? Of course I'm not encourage
such behavior at all. As a matter of fact, I'm totally appalled by a
phone call like this. But it is part of a growing pain I'm afraid, for
both me and Noah. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This always makes me wonder why human mind, as a clean sheet as a
kid's, will be attracted/impressed more by these, in our eyes, bad
things, than those, again in our eyes, the good things!? Is it by
nature that taboo is more attractive and exciting, thus leaving a
stronger impression in memory, thus making it more likely to pop up in
this type of events when he was easily carried away?  What is it that
makes these "fun", for him, but totally not acceptable by our social
standard by any dimension?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I don't know. I think I'm going down the path of generalization myself
now, and am using the word "any" a lot in this discussion, which, by
my own statement last weekend, can not be true, should not be true,
and is just bogus, because &lt;strong&gt;any&lt;/strong&gt; must speak for a generalization
which can not stand a test in logic &amp;larr; what do you mean by any!?
you only need one single counter example to defeat such
generalization. But then, there is these things, such as sexual
assault, which is bad bad bad, in any case, by any standard, and at
any time... so there I have it, an ANY-case, that, is always bad.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So you can try to fish out a counter example for the sake of
argument. But I think once it comes to a judgment, because it is
entirely and solely subjective, it becomes irrelevant whether it is a
generalization &amp;rarr; I think it is wrong, therefore it is wrong.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But the reverse is true, also &amp;rarr; I think it is right, therefore it
is right. What this means? That there isn't such a thing as being
objective? that there isn't a thing called truth? or fact? Even if
they exist, what role do they play in your judgment/conclusion? Isn't
it still your subjective decision to take them or leave them? to
believe them or disregard them? If so, what's the point anymore to dig
up truth? and isn't the version of &lt;em&gt;truth&lt;/em&gt; also a product of the
writer's or the investigator's conclusion, thus is also subjective!?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This can't be good. But I don't see a way out of this strange loop. A
sunny day today. Life is indeed, strange.&lt;/p&gt;</content><category term="thoughts"></category><category term="thoughts"></category></entry><entry><title>Domain knowledge</title><link href="https://fengxia41103.github.io/myblog/domain%20knowledge.html" rel="alternate"></link><published>2018-11-10T04:50:00-05:00</published><updated>2018-11-10T04:50:00-05:00</updated><author><name>Feng Xia</name></author><id>tag:fengxia41103.github.io,2018-11-10:/myblog/domain knowledge.html</id><summary type="html">&lt;figure class="col l6 m6 s12"&gt;

&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;What is a domain knowledge? Domain knowledge implies a knowing of a
specific area of knowledge, like plumber knows plumbing. It's quite
easy to picture that everyone, or should say every profession, is a
its own domain, thus has its own knowledge, which in true, in the same
sense that goes by a Chinese saying, 隔行如隔山. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;However, if we take it broadly, I would argue everything, every
person, has a domain knowledge of a sort that is unique only to that
person. Watching those "10 coolest hand-made toys" youtube videos make
you wonder how creative this person is, how much time s/he has at
hand, and deep down you also know that your brain is not up that, even
given you as much time &amp;mdash; you two are simply, different. Thus,
wouldn't it be fair to say that his/her domain knowledge is different
from yours then!? I think so. No two people are alike, which not only
means that no two people look identically, but also emphasizes their
knowledge repository …&lt;/p&gt;</summary><content type="html">&lt;figure class="col l6 m6 s12"&gt;

wouldn't it be fair to say that his/her domain knowledge is different
from yours then!? I think so. No two people are alike, which not only
means that no two people look identically, but also emphasizes their
knowledge repository, the structure of how they think, how they
perceive, how they process information and derive conclusion, and how
they reason &amp;rarr; in short, their domains are just different, thus
their domain knowledge will be different.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But "different" is itself a broad concept. It's another always-true
statement that people are just different &amp;larr; the counter argument
will be to find a black swan so to prove this statement is wrong. But
this type of always-true statement is not refutable. It has positioned
the question in such a way that it is simply futile to search for a
counter example. Rather, I would challenge the original argument and
its definition  in order to narrow down the scope of it. Once it
becomes more concrete ("being different" is quite an abstract concept,
but narrowing it down to "how are they different? they have different
colors." Well, that is refutable now, if we further define what is
color, and so on...), it becomes actioinable &amp;larr; we can either
prove it right, or wrong.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The reason I am talking about domain knowledge, is that at work I have
constantly run into ideas and projects, my own moonlight POCs
included, that when presenting to another audience to so called
&lt;em&gt;discussions&lt;/em&gt;, there are always two tyes of reactions &amp;mdash; some
find it exciting and &lt;em&gt;like it&lt;/em&gt;, and some put out a few concerns and
counter example, not to plainly shoot down the idea, but to bring in
caution and further &lt;em&gt;discussions&lt;/em&gt; &amp;rarr; these are all good point. But
my question is &amp;mdash; how do you distinguish yourself from an
&lt;strong&gt;existing&lt;/strong&gt; competitor!?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We recognize a "problem", and think we have a good idea to "fix
it". We even wrote some code to POC its feasibility and are hoping to
show its value. But the hard question is always, why you!? why yours!?
I used to draw this discussion eventually to domain knowledge, that
ours is, should be, better, because we have a better domain knowledge,
than competitors'. And if there is a work lagging, I would think that
they have not done their homework right to discover, consolidate, and
benefit from their domain knowledge. This sounds quite alright. But
with the arguments I have presented at the beginning of this article,
wouldn't it now sound fishy that using this ambiguous term is nothing
but to make myself sound smart which, by being an always-true
statement, giving others no chance to prove me wrong!? &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is terrible. But I don't want to yet give up its use. Here is
why. Take this hardware management tool for example. On one hand there
are opensource projects, free of charge; on the other company develops
a product. How to make the company one stand out then!? I mean, we
will lose to opensource simply by the sheer number of
developers, don't you think!? And in nowadays' tech stack, toolsets
are increasingly converging, meaning that if I were a front-end
developer and am asked to draw a line graph, there are only a few
libraries come to mind &amp;mdash; they all look alike, regardless how
well I can tweak them. And with that we also know that value is not at
the line graph even, it is what that graph can tell me, and what I can
do with that info, really matters. So how to achieve these two!?
Domain knowledge.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I firmly believe this is your only chance to stand out, and should be
the only criteria &amp;mdash; &lt;strong&gt;fundamentally it is information
asymmetry&lt;/strong&gt;. I have already said before that power lies in this, so
that's where the power to win over competition lies. There is no other
way. Vendor doesn't even need to intentionally build that barrier by
using something like a trade secret or patent, which lead to another
lengthy debate of moral sense of knowledge. Let's keep an open book. I
always argue that when was the last time you were willing to look at
someone's code, and could actually understand what it was saying!? or,
take any Physics text book, the laws are written down, figured out!
Yet, did you ever read them? and fewer understands them even! &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Therefore, domain knowledge is not secret, but a theory or practice
that is hard to replicate because of its complexity, not of its
secrecy. Vendor is naturally positioned in the front row of this race,
because they created that product at the first place &amp;mdash;
naturally, he knows more of it than anyone else &amp;larr; here, I want to
emphasize again that competing on just sheer data point level is going
to be a losing battle &amp;mdash; collect and display the same data point,
CPU, temperature, raid controller models... these are essential, but
these are the starting line every racer is at. Your advantage as a
vendor should display in the domain knowledge of what those numbers
mean, and what we could do with them &amp;mdash; CPU goes up 100%, is this
good? bad? When upgrading firmware, wouldn't vendor's tool, however
ugly it may be, still holds an edge over an opensource approach,
simply because we think vendor knows better of that level of
operation, and firmware is so fundamental that getting it wrong will
just kill your thousand dollar equipment!? These, is what I will call
domain knowledge &amp;mdash; an edge over others not because we keep
information from others. On the contrary, we just know more, know
better, and are fully willing to share. But these knowledge, really we
should call them &lt;strong&gt;experience&lt;/strong&gt;, like a personal experience, is so
hard to transfer, that it makes you, unique, thus valuable.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For these data driven applications, I think we can view them in three
layers:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Do I have data points that others don't have? &amp;rarr; protocol, or
   sheer openness.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Do I know a scenario of these data points that others don't have?
   &amp;rarr; support cases is a wealthy mine of real world experience. &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;When taking an action, can I keep the system stable and healthy
   better than others can?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I feel we have focuses too much on #1, which leads to competition of
cosmetic, user experience, and at most, convenience. However, none of
these will give you an edge:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;cosmetics: I have already said that toolsets are converging. Your
   line graph will not be that much different from ours. And even it's
   pleasing to look at, one quickly gets bored of it, and will ask the
   question &amp;mdash; what does this line mean?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;UX: this is an endless discussion, and let's leave it to people who
   have passion of, humans.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;convenience: do you realize that this actually implies that
   customer knows the same as you do!?  They are already doing it, but
   you think you have a better way. Then of course, the question is,
   how much better is yours? Well, this is like proving yourself worth
   being loved this girl, and we all know that's just pointless
   &amp;mdash; she loves, or not, has nothing to do with how good a person
   you actually are.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Instead, point #2 is a info repo vendor natually has, but simply will
not be accessible by the public, and don't we all know how creative
and bizarre the real world can be!? This gives you information that is
exclusive, and that leads to advantage!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Point #3 should come out of #2, and one failed at this, one should
fail to distinguish oneself, because this is where the gold is, this
is the &lt;strong&gt;domain knowledge&lt;/strong&gt;. Getting to this is hard, but that's how
it should be done.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So this lengthy, ambiguous, argument, is what I think about domain
knowledge.  Confusing, isn't it!?&lt;/p&gt;</content><category term="thoughts"></category><category term="thoughts"></category></entry><entry><title>Addiction</title><link href="https://fengxia41103.github.io/myblog/addiction.html" rel="alternate"></link><published>2018-11-08T20:37:00-05:00</published><updated>2018-11-08T20:37:00-05:00</updated><author><name>Feng Xia</name></author><id>tag:fengxia41103.github.io,2018-11-08:/myblog/addiction.html</id><summary type="html">&lt;figure class="col l5 m6 s12"&gt;

&lt;p&gt;What is an addiction then!? and why is this word negative!? I
think when we talk about this word, the implied message logic is that
&lt;em&gt;it is bad because it puts a person into an &lt;strong&gt;extreme&lt;/strong&gt; condition,
thus is not sustainable, thus is not healthy&lt;/em&gt; &amp;larr; so there are
quite a few assumptions:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Extreme state is, bad (but is it bad because of #2 below, that it
   is not sustainable!? or, regardless it is sustainable or not, it is
   just bad being in any kind of extreme? and is there such a thing as
   "extreme &amp;amp; good"?).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Unsustainable is no good. Well, this is actually interesting then,
   because then I would ask, what is the sustainable state!? Is
   drinking water instead of being an alcoholic more sustainable!? Is
   it defined as being able to live longer, thus more &lt;em&gt;sustainable&lt;/em&gt;?
   or less likely to be bored of!? This last one must not be true
   then, because alcoholics don't get bore of liquors, thus definition
   of this word, alcoholic!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So, it is not whether you will be tire of …&lt;/p&gt;</summary><content type="html">&lt;figure class="col l5 m6 s12"&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So, it is not whether you will be tire of doing the same thing over
   and over. What about being able to do that longer than others!?
   When you can walk longer than sprint, walking, is more sustainable
   than sprint. Therefore, if taking average course one can last
   longer than the other, this one is more sustainable.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;These two criteria have nothing to do with whether this addiction
   makes one happy. You can be addicted to an act that makes you
   really happy, but it is still an addiction, thus, bad.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So, is being in an extreme state really bad!? I actually start to think
that they are not.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;First of all, what is an alternative if not being extreme? Somewhere
in the middle. But how to identify of this point!? Without knowing it,
how do we know we are off!? and even if we do know where it is, is
keeping at that balance state all the time possible!? I would argue it
is not. So people are thinking of deviation &amp;mdash; what is the degree
of us deviating from this balance? But this leads to two questions:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;How to measure a deviation &amp;larr; and this implies we know two data
   points, the reference (that balance point), and where we are.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What is the criteria so it becomes bad?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So, as long as we don't have a definition of these two, we can't
battle "not being extreme", because we just don't know.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Secondly, we associate addition to things like smoking, drugs, these
things get you high, well, under the name of also &lt;em&gt;making you
happy&lt;/em&gt;. Therefore we think they are bad, because your body craves for
them once you are addicted. But is getting high, bad? We know these
things make your brain emmit some chemicals so you feel the
experience. But other actions can trigger them just as well &amp;mdash;
sports, sex, and in stone age days, hunting, war &amp;rarr; we know
getting in a fight will get your body into a state that it feels,
high, then extreme fatigue &amp;larr; isn't this the same cycle that
getting high experiences!? I don't know. Maybe they are different
chemicals, different processes, but I think there are tremendous
overlap between the two.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Thirdly, if getting high makes you, happy. Don't we all be pursuing,
happiness, in life, as the ultimate goal!? Then, here it is, why not!?
So it is not sustainable, won't last, but then, what will? I feel
there is a convolution of logic &amp;rarr; this doesn't feel right, but I
don't know what it is, 诡异的逻辑.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Well well. So I don't have an answer, not even a train of thoughts,
just a mess of conflicting statements. But still, as I have been
telling Noah, as I have been told by my dad at Noah's age, two things
don't touch &amp;mdash; drugs, and gambling. Addiction or not, they will
ruin your life, and your happiness.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Addicted to love? Might be ok.&lt;/p&gt;</content><category term="thoughts"></category><category term="thoughts"></category></entry><entry><title>A better world</title><link href="https://fengxia41103.github.io/myblog/a%20better%20world.html" rel="alternate"></link><published>2018-11-01T10:57:00-04:00</published><updated>2018-11-01T10:57:00-04:00</updated><author><name>Feng Xia</name></author><id>tag:fengxia41103.github.io,2018-11-01:/myblog/a better world.html</id><summary type="html">&lt;figure class="col s12"&gt;

&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It has been a fascinating thought to me &amp;mdash; is human the only
specie who thinks about leaving a better world for their children?
This perception, or statement, has been widely used in many talks,
conversations, lectures, debates, and propaganda, that by doing so and
so, we are to leave our children a better world. Or, often presented
in the opposite way, that by not doing so and so, we are leaving them
with a less world than ours, and shouldn't this give us, the current
generation, the moms and dads, a strong incentive to change!?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is how NPR's discussion of climate change has presented
itself. On one hand, I have been talking to Noah about becoming a
vegetarian. By eating less meat (here I'm also blindly taking someone
else's statement as truth &amp;larr; individually by eating less meat, we
could make our contribution to help the climate change catestrophe),
we are doing our share to help a change. But on the other, I was
thinking to myself, &lt;strong&gt;why leaving them with a better world is …&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</summary><content type="html">&lt;figure class="col s12"&gt;

we are doing our share to help a change. But on the other, I was
thinking to myself, &lt;strong&gt;why leaving them with a better world is taken as
an indisputable, wish!?&lt;/strong&gt; Don't we always argue that my definition of
&lt;em&gt;being better&lt;/em&gt; is not necessarily the same as theirs? Don't all parent
generation do this by imposing a superior knowledge that "I know what
is good for you", and gets back fired when their children grow up, and
the young generation simply ignores such advice or concern, and turns
out to be a life, sometimes better, sometimes worse, than previous
generation has predicted? Then, if we learn from the parental lesson
by treating kids as more of a peer than a brain-less walking body,
shouldn't we also apply the same principle in those grand topics, such
as climate change, that the children generation will, either live in a
world which is just different, or figure out a new way of living that
cope with the new environment, or even better (or worse) that their
definition of a &lt;em&gt;good life&lt;/em&gt; becomes a different version from ours?
&amp;larr; what we value as being good, such as nature, specie diversity,
blue sky, clean air, wouldn't it be that case that they will start to
like indoor, AC-ed environment, artificial lights, virtual reality,
and so on (don't these sound familiar already!?).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I understand this picture sounds really disturbing. But I am not too
sure that what I wish to leave them is actually good. If borrowing
from personal experience of love and relationship, I would even argue
that being good is not the point &amp;mdash; being what they want is
important. Hasn't there been enough cases we all know that being the
&lt;strong&gt;good guy&lt;/strong&gt; gets you nowhere, but giving her what she wants (if you
are lucky to know, or smart enough to figure it out) is what makes her
happy. Isn't that the whole point of "leaving them a better world" is
implying that a "better world" will make them happy!?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But how do we know!? or do we know? If I take this to an extreme, how
do we know that they don't love, war!? or death!? or bullying!? Aren't
we again giving them a world that conforms with our principle and
preference, while depriving them an opportunity to develop
&lt;em&gt;organically&lt;/em&gt; of their own!?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But this can't be right. I do think there is a consistent principle of
good versus bad &amp;mdash; clean air, good; smogs, bad. Safe environment,
good; discrimination, bad.... I'm speaking from my own education and
perception. I fully understand that Noah's generation will have
variation of many of these what I hold as true or dear.  But I still
believe there are things which are bad, regardless which generation is
in prime. War, for one, is bad. Human who are caught in it is
miserable, outright miserable.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What about ants? what's their good life, or better life? do they care
their children as we do? or they care them in a different way? This is
the same logic one debates about history &amp;mdash; what we judge of
history is at the point of view of ours. Rolling back to their time,
do they still appear the same way!? and since going back in time is
impossible, then how can we reconstruct the "back then" faithfully?
Wouldn't there be unlimited number of factors that it is
mathematically impossible to do so!? If we know about butterfly
effect, then unless we roll back in time, the entire analysis of
history and their lessons learned would be nothing but a &lt;strong&gt;subjective
opinion&lt;/strong&gt; by the author, wouldn't it!?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I don't know. The more I think about human society, about what is
good, what is right, the more I start to question whether there is a
&lt;strong&gt;truth&lt;/strong&gt; that is irrelevant from our interpretation, or &lt;a href="https://fengxia41103.github.io/myblog/imagination is life.html"&gt;everything is
just a human imagination&lt;/a&gt;. Take the dollar for example. We all know
that paper money is nothing but, a piece of paper. But then, is gold
really better than this paper!? Not really. It has not so called
&lt;strong&gt;intrinsic value&lt;/strong&gt; either. It is just a material, a carrier, that
many people agrees upon, that's all. It is always someone's dream that
you will find gold everywhere on Mars or somewhere, where it was
treated like dirt, but beings over there values, human waste, as their
"gold"!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is the same theme over and over and over. When US conquered the
West, native Indians couldn't care less about &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Great_Sioux_War_of_1876"&gt;gold mine in Black
Hill&lt;/a&gt;. Yet, gold is values by everyone else. So there you go,
people poured in to take over the territory which were protected by
law (at the time) as Indian reservation. You can call them driven by
greed. I think &lt;strong&gt;the essence of greed, is just, imagination&lt;/strong&gt;!! So
what they fought over essentially was a thing that lived in nothing
but imagination of a society (in our words, the modern society, but
really, is modern == more imagination!?), while yours (in this case
the local Indians) did not share the same imagination. But then, their
lives were destroyed because of it. How ugly! Honestly, I totally
believe that such imagination is both the core attribute of human, and
the core cause of everything terrible happening to human. In this
sense, I would even question whether propaganda is really such an
evil!? Isn't it just another form of, imagination!?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Strength is always the weakness&lt;/strong&gt;. The more creative we become, the
more we are encouraging imagination, the more wonders we will see and
implement, then, the more nasty, ugly, terrible traits human will
develop, will demonstrate, will endure.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Is this good? bad? better? or worse?&lt;/p&gt;</content><category term="thoughts"></category><category term="thoughts"></category></entry><entry><title>Early morning</title><link href="https://fengxia41103.github.io/myblog/early%20morning.html" rel="alternate"></link><published>2018-10-29T04:32:00-04:00</published><updated>2018-10-29T04:32:00-04:00</updated><author><name>Feng Xia</name></author><id>tag:fengxia41103.github.io,2018-10-29:/myblog/early morning.html</id><summary type="html">&lt;figure class="col s12"&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I'm getting used to getting up early to feed them. But I still can't
get used to not thinking of you, when I'm awake, when I'm lying there
in an early winter morning like this. Where are you?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I don't know where you are anymore, nor hear from you of anything in
your life. Sometimes I feel quite upset about this, that I'm now out
of your life, maybe even for the rest of it, that I am nothing but a
stranger to you, like million others in that city, in this world. Yet,
you are not someone whom I only bump into on a street. The days, the
moments kept coming back to me, day and night.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I haven't had a nice afternoon nap like yesterday for a long time.
Noah and his mom were at church. Waking up, a room filled with cozy
sunshine, and zhu wawa cuddling next to me, twisting left and right,
as if don't know how to show off his cuteness and his yearning for
love anymore, stretching stretching …&lt;/p&gt;</summary><content type="html">&lt;figure class="col s12"&gt;

sunshine, and zhu wawa cuddling next to me, twisting left and right,
as if don't know how to show off his cuteness and his yearning for
love anymore, stretching stretching, he put his soft paws over my
mouth, as if to say "don't say anything"... it was a moment I felt
genuinely happy, a life with loved one near by, no more, no less. All
of sudden, I realized one thing, that happiness only exists in
moments, and a moment can only be counted in a split of second, then
disappears, becoming a past, becoming only a memory one could think
of, but never able to keep.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I miss you, my dear sunshine, wherever you are, I miss you. I miss the
evening when we sat on top of 南山 watching the city lights under our
feet, miss the day we went out for a day tour roaming around the city,
ended up climbing this little hill and finding a temple with no other
tourist but us, and you tripped on a stair, and I pretended we were
shooting a movie scene, how funny that was! I remember you holding a
stick in hand like a little boy with his sword marching on, remember
arcades when you raced against a group of teenager boys who must have
been fascinated by having someone like you to join. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You are special. No matter how hard I tried to leave you, to put these
moments to rest, they will not go. There is nothing I can do
about. They are here, to stay. If unhappiness are simply longer, more,
than those happy moments, then happiness has to be sharper, stronger,
to balance, and that's what they are &amp;mdash; these memories, these
moments when I see them like a movie playing in my head, scene by
scene, over and over and over, is what keep me warm, keep me sane. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Darkness is all over me; you, gave me light.&lt;/p&gt;</content><category term="thoughts"></category><category term="love"></category></entry><entry><title>Law</title><link href="https://fengxia41103.github.io/myblog/law.html" rel="alternate"></link><published>2018-10-06T09:17:00-04:00</published><updated>2018-10-06T09:17:00-04:00</updated><author><name>Feng Xia</name></author><id>tag:fengxia41103.github.io,2018-10-06:/myblog/law.html</id><summary type="html">&lt;figure class="col l6 m6 s12"&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It is, I think, the darkest moment in history, that I have been
experienced in this great country. Listening to senator hearing for
the first time last Thursday, and I was both impressed by the
capability to grasp the core of the issue that these senators
demonstrated, and the disturbing display by this guy who is bitter,
angry, aggressive, eager to please his boss, and not hesitating to
express a statement in the form of a conspiracy, even linking it to
"the Clintons", who, regardless what type of opponent they have been
in the presidential race, not to mention that Mr. Clinton has been a
real president elected and was doing a good job by the measure of
economy. What type of person would this guy be that he is now being
bestowed the &lt;strong&gt;super power&lt;/strong&gt; of being a life-long employed judge

sitting on the bench of a sacred institution, which I have always
viewed with awe and respect, because I thought it holds all the wisdom
in this world despite how hard, how difficult to determine, the
problem it is assigned to make a decision (think about abortion, gay
marriage, anything racial). If we say that the US government has had
periods and presidents that failed to win the respect of the world,
and had flunked terribly in making this country and this world a
better place, this Supreme Court has always been the last line of
defense that people could still trust, still have a faith that truth,
objectivity, fairness, righteousness, and an idealism that runs in the
core of this form of democracy, is being held, being guarded, firmly
and thoroughly. They are like the priests of today's society. When all
measures fail, we believe they know better, and will guide us out of
trouble and chaos.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But all these have been proven to be an illusion, shattered. I don't
have an opinion whether he had really done the harassment back 30 some
years. I'm against him not because I think he has violated the
law. But as a job applicant, he has shown himself not be a proper
candidate for the job. Period. Let me ask you this, when was the last
time you interviewed someone, asking him/her a question, and this
person just throw it back at you &amp;mdash; do you know the answer?
&amp;mdash; or even making a comment that your question is just an attack
on behalf of some organization, some ideology, some force!!!!?? Give
me a break! You tell me, will you hire this person!? This is truly a
running joke. I don't care how qualified s/he is, how wonderful s/he
can do the job, I don't think manager will embrace an employee who has
such attitude, not to mention the teammates who will be working with
this person!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yes, this is another question I want to ask &amp;mdash; why the other
judges have no saying in this interview!? Aren't they the people who
will be working as this elite &lt;strong&gt;team&lt;/strong&gt;!? Then, shouldn't they also
give a vote on whom they feel comfortable to work with!? This is
totally absurd!!! If judicial branch is designed to be independent
from other two branches, why in the hell is the head of the executive
branch nominating this candidate!???? This is truly contradictory to
what I have always believed the merit of this system. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And honestly, the more I'm witness these type of fiasco unfold in
front of the public's eyes, the more I recall Tom's comment before the
2016 election, that "Trump will the worst" possible person for the
job. At the time, without having any experience with Trump, I had
hoped, and sometimes even hailed, his disruptive manner to the
traditional political cliches. But now, I feel he is a total disaster,
totally, disastrous. He runs this country as if this is his family
business, and he demonstrated a trait of a dictator, a moody one I
should say, like no others I have seen (except Billismo). He might be
capable, but I'm against any form of such singular, super,
concentrated, unchallenged, authority! any!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is a form that leads China into a totalitarian path, leads an
engineering team into low efficiency, leads an inevitable pattern of
irresponsibility, because it allows one, and only one, decision making
process, that is top down, single to N, and no feedback
loop. Participants will throw up their hands and say, you know what,
I'll just do what you say, but I won't contribute any of my minds,
because it's useless, won't be considered, and even could bring fire
on my own &amp;mdash; but you see, where then will be the line between
being a member of a team, and being but a slave!?? This exactly why I
hate, hate the authoritarian approach of the Chinese management style,
and now why I am feeling so upset of what this country is heading.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is indeed, terrible, even horrible. Kavanaugh had one thing
right, the effect of this event will be felt long after this has passed
us. I don't know how Supreme Court will function and be viewed
since. One thing I'm sure &amp;rarr; politics are ugly, disgraceful, and
frustrating, in both camps of the Western's and the Eastern's. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And, hold on for two more year. I'm sure to vote in 2020. Trump, out.&lt;/p&gt;</content><category term="thoughts"></category><category term="thoughts"></category></entry><entry><title>Dictator, human language, concept</title><link href="https://fengxia41103.github.io/myblog/dictator.html" rel="alternate"></link><published>2018-10-05T10:39:00-04:00</published><updated>2018-10-05T10:39:00-04:00</updated><author><name>Feng Xia</name></author><id>tag:fengxia41103.github.io,2018-10-05:/myblog/dictator.html</id><summary type="html">&lt;figure class="col l6 m6 s12"&gt;

&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Here is a really interesting conversation with Noah. We have been
watching a documentary (&lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JhXKlYnSWjA"&gt;Soviet Storm: World War II — In The
East.&lt;/a&gt;). At his age he is absorbed to the war scenes. Then, driving
from his school we were talking about how Russia fought the war, he
started saying that Stalin is the head of all Russian troops, and he
quoted a &lt;em&gt;famous order&lt;/em&gt; by him that no one can retreat (I think he was
talking about the Leninggrad).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So I said, you know, Stalin was actually a terrible person. "Why?"
"Cause he is a dictator." "What is a dictator?" I actually don't
know. I tried to come up with a definition, "Dictator is someone who
does not like disagreement. He only wants what he wants." "Oh"&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Then, we were talking about German, "Hitler is a dictator, too." I
said. "No!" "What do you mean by no!?" I was rather &lt;strong&gt;alarmed&lt;/strong&gt;!
"Adolf is not a dictator!" He said it in such an affirmative tone that
I was truly start to wonder what type of message …&lt;/p&gt;</summary><content type="html">&lt;figure class="col l6 m6 s12"&gt;

I was truly start to wonder what type of message/impression he has got
about Adolf Hitler. "But why you say so?" "Because, there is a general
who was constantly disgreeing with Adolf. Constantly!" errr.....&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This makes me wonder, how many of these knowledge we have taken so
much for granted, never questioned much, thought we have comprehended
thorough without doubt (of course, who could argue when we say Stalin
and Hitler were dictators? and don't we all know what dictator is,
when we see one!?). Then, come along these kids. You star to realize
just how uncertain you actually are about what you think you
know. Really, dictator, how to define it? and is that definition,
whatever it is, questionable also? What about other words, probably
good words? What are they? Why there are some traits in human we have
always admired, respected, hoped to become, like integrity, honest,
kindness? Or, are they also recent events, maybe after the
Renaissance(?), like the idea of State, patriotism, identity of a
country, or race? &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I have always challenged the human language that on the one hand they
are necessary to describe, to communicate, thus essential to us. Yet,
they are constantly in flux that new words created at the moment that
fits perfect for its meaning, then it gets lost, even reversed, in the
different setting, but we continue take them as if they hold one and
only one interpretation. And even worse, language, any nouns, are
nothing but a label, and people use and abuse these labels to achieve
their goals (politics comes to mind, which is notoriously prevalent in
labeling opponents as if the label itself represents an objective
opinion. Yet we all know there is not objectivity in this exercise at
all &amp;larr; by logic, noun/label can only be a subjective opinion
because naming anything, anyone, is nothing but a human mind
activity &amp;mdash; cloud is perfect fine on its own with or without a
name to it, and it certainly was never consulted whether it likes the
name &lt;code&gt;cloud&lt;/code&gt;, maybe it likes the name &lt;code&gt;mary&lt;/code&gt; better!?).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So, where is the balance, if there is one at all!? We have to use a
language in life, but we are caught by this invention. Now with the
amass population of social media and mobile device, communication has
expanded in magnitude. So we see the phenomenon of all kinds of word
games, some funny, some outright ugly because they are a lie. See,
even while writing this, I have inevitably used the word &lt;code&gt;lie&lt;/code&gt; to
describe a concept I am thinking. Yet, there is nothing about this
word that holds a truth of any kind. Only because it has been learned
by million other English speakers so we are &lt;em&gt;on the same page&lt;/em&gt; of what
it means. Martian might as well have called it &lt;strong&gt;truth&lt;/strong&gt;, and confused
the hell out of all earth people.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Well, is it a concept in mind that drives the use of a label? Like the
talk of dictator. I was trying to convey a concept of a type of
person/behavior to Noah. So I guess the only solution is if one can
transmit mind wave to another human being, somehow, and gets
understood. No words required. But how do we verify even if this is
possible? I mean, how do I know s/he gets the &lt;em&gt;concept&lt;/em&gt; exactly as I
transmitted? As an engineer I actually don't see a solution at
all. Even in this scenario, we are implying that the two are both
alive! The best value of literature is that thoughts/concepts can
carry over time &amp;larr; this makes it possible for human knowledge pool
to increment.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But then, there is love, when two souls are indeed in sync, in a
mysterious way, that no words are necessary, but they understand each
other, feel each other, ALWAYS, on the same page. So there must be
hope, of some kind. I guess for now, Noah, the word "dictator" is just
bad. It's the concept that matters, not the definition.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It has been said that what makes human &lt;em&gt;superior to&lt;/em&gt; (or different
from) other species on this planet is that human is the only one that
can imagine; others operate off facts and reality. They do not possess
the skill (or the brain capacity) to imagine a virtual world,
something that is not there, that is &lt;em&gt;maybe&lt;/em&gt;, that is possible.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is quite interesting, because it definitely feels so &amp;mdash; we
are often moved and motivated by a futuristic view, which may or may
not pan out to be the case. Yet we get excited about it, work hard
based on such projection, and gets disappointed if it doesn't realize
the way we &lt;em&gt;want&lt;/em&gt;. So is love, is life.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I was thinking today while limping along &amp;rarr; what makes of life?
what makes one full of life?  why getting old makes one, less lively,
appearing to have less life?  Is it really the beauty, the young skin,
the age? These are rather, factual. There is no denial that elders
don't look &lt;em&gt;as good&lt;/em&gt;, but that is also …&lt;/p&gt;</summary><content type="html">&lt;figure class="col l8 m8 s12"&gt;

appearing to have less life?  Is it really the beauty, the young skin,
the age? These are rather, factual. There is no denial that elders
don't look &lt;em&gt;as good&lt;/em&gt;, but that is also by the eyes of the young I
would think. Even when I heard other species don't imagine, I would
have argued that there are two assumptions to this that can be
challenged:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;how do you know a frog doesn't imagine?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;you can't impose your definition of &lt;em&gt;imagination&lt;/em&gt; upon a frog cause
   s/he (or it) also imagine, but differently from yours.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Therefore, using this statement to support the argument that human
thus is better, is rather groundless &amp;larr; this is the same when you
say you are the best looking person in the world (or your mom says so)
because you are using a standard so subjective (and almost absolutely
unique) that no one else can match. As soon as we start to question
the objectivity of it, the saying crumbles down.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So aging, wrinkled skins, lost physiques, can not be used to make the
case of having less life. In the eyes of the 80s, ladies in their 60s
are young (then how funny that human is so obsessed of age difference
when they are actually young! A love between a 20-year-old girl and a
40-year-old guy often gets a rap as if the girl is at loss and the guy
is taking advantage of her). And even their definition of life has
likely changed from the ones I'm thinking of &amp;larr; maybe they view
experience of ups and downs more valuable than a pretty face, a
healthy teeth more than a flush hair.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Then, what about the proximity to death? Surely the closer you are,
the less life you should have. This sounds right. Yet, how to explain
people who are more, lively, in their 80s than someone who is in the
20s!? Stress? Unhappiness? unfairly treated by life? bad luck?... None
of this sounds right.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here is my theory. &lt;strong&gt;The degree of life is indeed defined by the 
capacity to imagine.&lt;/strong&gt; The more of you that is still willing to
imagine, and the less you are views things in its reality and be
annoyed by it (or, like me these days, even upset by it), the more
life you have. Kids are known to be master of imagination, and no one
could deny that kids, all of them, are full of life, energy. Yet, we
will also agree that they are the farthest from reality &amp;larr; they
take no notice of time, no etiquette of any except their instinct, no
sense of order, completion, anything.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When they start to grow up, they are thrown into the reality and
forced to learn, to adapt, and to replace, bit by bit, their
imaginative world with facts. Like the talk on NPR today, human took
astrology because they thought the sky, the wind, the sun, the moon
were talking to him, telling him it is time to plant, to harvest, and
so on (what a self-important view!). Then, came the scientist, whose
so called truth (physics) tells the complete opposite &amp;larr; that you
are nobody in this world, no sun god is overseeing your business, you
better either plant your seed when the time is right, which physics
and satellite are making it pin-point accurate, or your crop will
fail. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the pre-weather-forecast version, we feel loved, we revered these
mysterious forces, we feel connected, there is life in everything; in
the factual world, yes we as a specie has advanced and has gained much
more control than sacrificing a pig to pray for rain. Yet, we have
less &lt;em&gt;life&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When I'm depressed, I feel the say way. When I got frustrated by some
BS talks and wondered how people can be blind to such contradicting
reasoning and sometimes pure lies, life itself becomes a burning hell.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Then, when love strikes, when a picture of her and a life with her
dangling in front of my mind, life is wonderful. So I think the
argument is indeed correct &amp;mdash; that human is defined by its
capacity to imagine, not by its capacity to take facts. Old people
don't have less life because they are old, but because they know more,
they see more reality, and they put less weight to imagine. Not that
they don't imagine. I think they do; I think we will also do. Just
that when you imagine, you hear louder and louder a voice in your
head, in your heart, telling you this is virtual.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When we gain the capability to distinguish reality from fiction, we
are becoming stronger, wiser, a better person, I believe. Then, like
everything else in life, we pay a price of not believing in a tin
solider friend, or love, or a rosy future. We feel, less life.&lt;/p&gt;</content><category term="thoughts"></category><category term="thoughts"></category></entry><entry><title>How hard is it to listen?</title><link href="https://fengxia41103.github.io/myblog/hard%20to%20listen.html" rel="alternate"></link><published>2018-10-01T18:10:00-04:00</published><updated>2018-10-01T18:10:00-04:00</updated><author><name>Feng Xia</name></author><id>tag:fengxia41103.github.io,2018-10-01:/myblog/hard to listen.html</id><summary type="html">&lt;figure class="col l6 m6 s12"&gt;

&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I guess it must be hard. Noah completely tipped me off again
today. His glasses were bent (slightly), and I asked him what
happened. He said there was nothing. Then he said yes he was hit by
somebody. Then the story turned out to be that he chose to be under
someone's chair during &lt;em&gt;independent reading&lt;/em&gt; time, and the kid kicked
into his face, somehow. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I was totally mad! on multiple degrees!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;First, lie. I hate this. If you  did it, admit it. Don't try to wiggle
out of it,  especially when you are  only, what, 10!? There  is no way
you are going to fool me yet. And, didn't we just talk about this last
week, that  any lie will  only lead  to more lies  so it rolls  like a
snowball until a spectacular fall. The longer you can cover it up, the
messier it will be  when it crashes. I know kid  doesn't this yet. But
this is a lesson in life, and he needs to learn it, needs to memorizes
this, needs …&lt;/p&gt;</summary><content type="html">&lt;figure class="col l6 m6 s12"&gt;

this is a lesson in life, and he needs to learn it, needs to memorizes
this, needs to &lt;strong&gt;never do this again&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Second, integrity. We just went over  last week! I was pissed off when
finding out during a school's parent even that he had skipped A LOT of
works in  class (I'm talking  4 out of 5  pages are just  blank!!!) He
said  they are  optional.  Fine.  But even  the  required  one is  not
completed! We had  a long discussion after it, and  it wasn't pleasant
at all. I brought up the  topic of &lt;code&gt;integrity&lt;/code&gt;, which his social study
went over in 3rd grade. Integrity, is  to do the right thing even when
no one  is looking or knowing.  I was using  it to tell him  that even
without me  finding out, he should  have been a good  student in these
classes  by doing  his homework  and  listening to  teachers. But,  he
didn't, and this is really upsetting.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Even just a couple weeks ago, we were joking about his 1st grade day
when the Japanese teacher emailed us about his &lt;strong&gt;unacceptable
behavior&lt;/strong&gt; in her class. He said, "I remembered!" I was actually
rather surprised, and impressed. But then!? This!? This is really
disappointing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Third, poor judgment. I really hate to say this, but putting your own
face to someone's foot as a fun way to play, in class!!?, is just
plain stupid. He was asking for it, asking for the damage, asking to
be kicked. He didn't care a thing about what could have happened to
his glasses, to his safety.. this is just, fxxxx, stupid! I wish the
kid could have kicked a lot harder than just causing a bent glasses,
if only he could then learn the lesson. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I don't know. Sometimes I really feel he has a terrible judgement. I
try to argue that it is his age, and his even less age than his
calendar age psychologically. Yet, I really think this will carry into
his life even when he is older. Poor judgment don't just go away. I
have witnesses many in adults, and it just amazes me how and why these
people could not comprehend &amp;mdash; people racing to a red light,
saying one thing while acting another, pretending what they are not,
feeling blown up as if they were god, looking down people who serve
them, believing a superficial statement w/o questioning or even
thinking.....&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I don't know. By being different, Noah is actually becoming the very
opposite of his wishes &amp;rarr; he is becoming commonly mindless,
stupid, mass.&lt;/p&gt;</content><category term="thoughts"></category><category term="thoughts"></category></entry><entry><title>Total Happiness</title><link href="https://fengxia41103.github.io/myblog/total%20happiness.html" rel="alternate"></link><published>2018-09-26T10:45:00-04:00</published><updated>2018-09-26T10:45:00-04:00</updated><author><name>Feng Xia</name></author><id>tag:fengxia41103.github.io,2018-09-26:/myblog/total happiness.html</id><summary type="html">&lt;figure class="col s12"&gt;

&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I was thinking. If we add up the total happiness of this world, versus
all the grief, sadness, unhappiness, how would they come out to be?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I'm depressed. Noah is not doing his homework at school, and he is
moving too much in class, as usual. It pissed me off, and made me
really feeling powerless. He is refusing to grow up, but I'm getting
old, and nothing is being done. While I was feeling the blues, I start
to wonder everyone I saw roaming around the campus whether s/he has a
blue day also. I'm sure everybody has. I have long been convinced that
there is nobody's life you would be willing to swap once you learn how
messy and imperfect theirs is. Just like mine, just like yours.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So if we ever add them all up, are there more happiness than
unhappiness? On the one hand, we will all agree that happy time is
much less than unhappy time in one's life. So it seems that by sheer
number unhappiness will win …&lt;/p&gt;</summary><content type="html">&lt;figure class="col s12"&gt;

unhappiness? On the one hand, we will all agree that happy time is
much less than unhappy time in one's life. So it seems that by sheer
number unhappiness will win. Then, when you are in love, the intensity
of that happiness is so strong that it can probably offset a lot of
unhappy days.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But then, isn't there also a theory that people are more sensitive to
loss than to gains? This would lead to the opposite conclusion that
intensity of loss, thus unhappy days, more than that of happy days?
Then, which is correct?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I don't know. Blues, depression, frustration, days without excitement
and without hope... it is certainly not fun.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I try to picture a day by the Charles, watching sunset, watching
people, watching geese flying by, watching the days go by. It's the
same 24 hours like everywhere else on this planet. It doesn't change a
thing, practically speaking. Will that really make a difference? If
so, how different? and why different?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I don't know. I guess people are yearning to a new environment,
because, like taking vacation, you walk away from a set of life as if
all the problems in that life can be ignored, made to disappear. Some of
them will, actually, since new setting makes them not applicable
anymore.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Then, there are others, will not go away. They are more patient than
we want them to be. They sit still, wait for you to come back, then
reassert themselves in front of you, may not be all at once, but
surely, persistently, stubbornly, like a trickle, they emerge silently
onto the stage, even without a word, you know, it's there.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I used to believe the total luck in one's life is a fixed number. Thus
using it up front in your younger years will leave less for later, and
vice versa. I wonder the total unhappiness in this world is a fixed
number, too. Lovers generate happiness, few, but intense. The the same
amount unhappiness is needed to counter balance them, spread out, like
air, blanket many, maybe everybody, with a tint of blue.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Like rain falling from sky, leave a few spots on everyone's
t-shirt. Instead of being water, it's ink, permanent mark, a dot,
tarnish a perfect white T, some finds it beautiful, some is
annoyed, nobody has a detergent to wash it off.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That's unhappiness, in life.&lt;/p&gt;</content><category term="thoughts"></category><category term="thoughts"></category></entry><entry><title>Life without meaning</title><link href="https://fengxia41103.github.io/myblog/life%20without%20meaning.html" rel="alternate"></link><published>2018-09-19T10:45:00-04:00</published><updated>2018-09-19T10:45:00-04:00</updated><author><name>Feng Xia</name></author><id>tag:fengxia41103.github.io,2018-09-19:/myblog/life without meaning.html</id><summary type="html">&lt;figure class="col l6 m6 s12"&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I don't know. All of a sudden while walking back from gym to office, I
felt this moment of, emptiness. Really. It's a sensation I never had
before. It's not a strong feeling, but distinctly there, that life is
blank, meaningless.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I lost the touch of what it is for, what there is to looked forward
to, what is in there for me. The sky is blue, temperature comfortable,
nothing dramatic in life, everyday is a routine. Why I had this
feeling then?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I missed you a lot today. I wanted to write you something. But we are
soo far apart now, I don't even know what to call you anymore. I feel
awkward to begin a letter, though I so want to chat with you, to learn
what you are up to, how life has treated you, and whether you are
happy. I'm worried. There have been many disturbing nights I dreamed
of you. Waking up in the middle of night, I wanted to talk to you,

happy. I'm worried. There have been many disturbing nights I dreamed
of you. Waking up in the middle of night, I wanted to talk to you,
hear your voice, to know you are ok. But then, I'm also afraid. I
shouldn't interrupt your quiet life. You should live the way you want
to, and secretly I'm still hoping that someday I will get a message
from you, even just a &lt;code&gt;hi&lt;/code&gt;, so I know you have not forgotten me.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Is this silly? or just too idealistic? I don't know. This is part of
me I can not change I guess. I have always been living in this
idealistic world, in which there is no BS, no pretense, no
self-importance, no so called conventional wisdom that 5-year apart is
an ideal for a couple &amp;larr; BS! total BS. Age should never be a
factor to determine. After all, how many can you meet in life? and why
age gap is anything but an invention of human since time itself is
nothing but an invention? Further, why age is so important when we are
young, yet when I get to 60s, suddenly I can marry someone in 40s and
everyone will just be ok!? But it's 10+ years of gap! Why is it ok
then, but not now?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I hate this type of social norms. To me, they are not norms at
all. They are sayings inherited from past but no one has questioned
its standing, and everyone accepts it on face value. Sad. This leads
all kinds of unhappiness for individuals whose heart says
otherwise. This same bond has an effect on me also, that I felt
uncomfortable w/ you because you are so young, so beautiful, so
perfect. I wish I could live out of these things I hate. Yet, myself
is caught in it and could not get away. How sad really! I guess I'm
not really as strong as I picture myself to be, or wish myself to
be. It takes two to make a couple. I think you did fine, it's me who
is still a slave of convention.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I don't know. Thinking of you fills my morning in many days. It's
bitter an sweet. I try to sense you in this universe, try to feel how
you feel. I can't seem to know anymore.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It's a life, without meaning, when you are not there.&lt;/p&gt;</content><category term="thoughts"></category><category term="love"></category></entry><entry><title>Burned out</title><link href="https://fengxia41103.github.io/myblog/burned%20out.html" rel="alternate"></link><published>2018-09-18T10:36:00-04:00</published><updated>2018-09-18T10:36:00-04:00</updated><author><name>Feng Xia</name></author><id>tag:fengxia41103.github.io,2018-09-18:/myblog/burned out.html</id><summary type="html">&lt;figure class="col l4 m4 s12"&gt;

listening, miss the minutes I was leaning on Ray's tomb in this cold
winter day, just him and I, I played my music, which I know he would
laugh at me again if he were there, yet it was a music in the all
yard, sunny, cold, winter day, so out of tune, so out of place, so
warm, lively, and peace.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I feel sad, maybe it's just depression again. It comes in waves. On
some days it was bad, then hope and happiness kicked in in others, and
life became endurable again. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Why is missing somebody so hard? Why is it that we will miss somebody,
some days, some moments, some blinks in life, and they will never
fade? I don't know whether it's just me or it's a human trait &amp;larr; I
always feel I'm living in the past. I always tried best to be nice and
to appreciate the present. Yet, things inevitably slip into a past
term, left me with nothing but a tremendous ocean of sadness and
memory.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But in memory, she lives, safe and sound, immune to time, immune to
all the bad things in life, immune to hardship, forever young, forever
lovely, forever beautiful, forever close by.&lt;/p&gt;</content><category term="thoughts"></category><category term="thoughts"></category></entry><entry><title>2nd Child Policy</title><link href="https://fengxia41103.github.io/myblog/2nd%20child%20policy.html" rel="alternate"></link><published>2018-09-13T19:19:00-04:00</published><updated>2018-09-13T19:19:00-04:00</updated><author><name>Feng Xia</name></author><id>tag:fengxia41103.github.io,2018-09-13:/myblog/2nd child policy.html</id><summary type="html">&lt;figure class="col s12"&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iL5PnFojoj8"&gt;This&lt;/a&gt; has to be the most disturbing talk I have ever heard so far, and
this makes me very angry.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The talk is about China's new policy to encourage having more than one
child, and these people talked about possible ways to turn the tide of
China's declining population.  Sigh. But this is truly sad sad sad in
multiple ways  and it is  totally disgusting, misleading,  wrong, just
morally wrong,  technically wrong,  politically wrong,  and absolutely
against humanity!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;180 turn&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;No where they every even dared to touch the No.1 topic I think they
should have discussed &amp;larr; this is truly an elephant in the room,
yet everybody turns his head and as if it doesn't exist!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;How can a country reverse its one-child policy, the one that has been
criticized by human right group, by UN, by everybody except China
itself, just like that!&lt;/strong&gt; How can this be acceptable!!! This speaks to

a case in point of China's opaque decision making process that a
policy that was sooo dear and soooo important that if you get caught
you will be fined and be humiliated and even harmed in public, now
suddenly, turns into a reverse gear, with equal justification, equal
legitimacy, equal support by these experts!! &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This, to me, is the scarest thing! Come on. How can I trust such
process that it does not turn on me someday and crush me because its
agenda puts me in its way! This is like a HUGE truck on the road but
switching lane at a blink of eye without giving signal, without
apology, without any concern of who the hell is driving next it, or
being on board! In daily life we will take this driver to be mad, to
be irresponsible (in polite term), and will shun from him/her as much
as we can. Yet, when it is a government, a country, no one, no one in
this talk even dare to stand up to challenge authority with this
question:"So, were we wrong in the past!? If so, shouldn't you
apologize!?"&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Talking about 知识份子的良心, which I see none! Sigh.... this is total
bullshit! total disgust! totally purely, wrong!.. You know, with such
pattern unchallenged, such decision making unchanged, un-reviewed,
un-criticized, un-punished, we are letting our own life to be
manipulated, and eventually, to be crushed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;for the greater good&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I have argued in &lt;a href="https://fengxia41103.github.io/myblog/too much trust.html"&gt;too much trust&lt;/a&gt; in multi folds that anything, I
mean, anything, that is titled as "for a greater good", should be
carefully examined, eagerly questioned, cautiously observed, hardly
participated, never (by all means) obeyed and adopted.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;How can anyone even allow such a saying as "为国生娃"!!!!!! Not to
mention this State has not been a nice companion to be with!? Isn't
this like asking a woman to bear you a child while you are treat her
like trash!? and of course, your argument is that without me you would
have been living on a street... doesn't this sound familiar to you!?
Oh my god, how can anyone in 21st century, boasting to be educated, be
civilized, be westernized, be modern, fall in such a stupidity!!! This
is outrageous! Pure insanity!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Stop preaching "do this for your country"!!! No, I don't want to give
birth to my child because it is mainstream! No. I can do it for love,
for a sexual need, for my own reason of any kind, but the last thing
on my mind when I have sex is to be patriotic!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;How bizzare it is!! How dare you to ask me to do so!?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;leading to humanity disaster&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What they don't realize, and this truly saddens me and scares me, is
that this argument is paving the way to a humanity disaster. Here is
how this logic will unfold.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;First of all, this is total discrimination against age, against old
people. I have long debated with myself that from an engineer's point
of view to optimize efficiency and maximize social progress, I, if
were a dictator, would have a policy to eliminate the elders as soon
as his/her contribution is less than his/her cost &amp;larr; but I could
never bring myself to agree with such conclusion. This is wrong, even
logically I think it is correct, but morally, humanely, personally, it
is WRONG WRONG WRONG! &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We must be alarmed by the name &lt;strong&gt;aging society&lt;/strong&gt;, which ironically has
been on this path for the last 30+ years, and yet as if everybody is
suddenly waking up from a dream, and switching immediately into a
panic mode! Demographics can neither be increased in a short term, nor
decreased in a short term. Period. Again, what we should have
questioned is why China has been ignoring this long-term trend all
along, and continue to treat this topic as if it's an on-off switch
&amp;mdash; turn it on, make 1 million babies, right now! This is fuxxed
up. Paving a justification to view aging in such a negative way will
lead to policy to remove "un-contributing" population &amp;larr; this is
nothing but the same method that all humanity disaster has started
with, some kind of philosophy to:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;establish the objective to be &lt;strong&gt;optimal&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;label and remove the &lt;strong&gt;inefficient&lt;/strong&gt; ones&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Wake up people. You might be ok in your 20s, 30s, 40s, but such a
mentality is a beast out of cage &amp;larr; once it is out, it will crash
and burn in blood, and it doesn't really care whose blood it takes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Second, when talking about policy to &lt;strong&gt;encourage birth&lt;/strong&gt;, it is
inevitably leading to a social view of some group being preferred to
others. If, as one of the expert said "for example, letting coastal
residents to..." (essentially enjoying a previlege of a kind), it is
nothing but a one step away from what we have all learned in class, in
TV, in any book of WWII, that "&lt;blank&gt; people are inferior
race... thus..." &amp;larr; you know what this is!? This is fascism, is
racial discrimination, and can only be ended with war, with terrible
social and human cost. &lt;strong&gt;How can anyone in today's civilization say
such a thing without feeling shame!!??&lt;/strong&gt; geeee.... if only these
people take a step back and read what I have just said, they will
realize how terrible himself/herself has just sounded!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;self-conflicting&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It's a common saying, and is the baseline of all these people's
argument, that people don't want to have more kids because:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;People with good education don't like to have babies because, it
   will lower their quality of life&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;People who have good life don't like to have babies because, it will
   lower their quality of life.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Well well well. Now let me ask you this: &lt;strong&gt;do you wish your kid to
have a good/better life than yours? and do you wish them to have
good/better education?&lt;/strong&gt; I have yet to meet a single parent who says
No to this. Well, then, following the initial logic, doesn't this mean
that the next generation will have less babies because, they will have
a better education &amp;amp; better life than their parents'!?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So, if our goal is to reverse this population trend, it seems to me
the logical step should be &lt;strong&gt;to lower education and to lower quality
life&lt;/strong&gt; of our next generation, so that they will be willing to give more
birth! Now, people, will you still be &lt;em&gt;patriotic&lt;/em&gt;?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You see, this is a completely conflicting logic that they are stating
without thinking over how this will unfold. And honestly, let's be
straight here:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;High education &amp;amp; life quality is not in negative correlation with
child birth. On the contrary, parents wanting their kids to have a
good life is a great thing. (Speaking for any parents), it is super
important that the society in the future, in the next 25 years when my
son grows up, is in a good shape. I want to do my part, not only for
my own sake, but also for Noah to have a good life. That, is a strong
motivation, to be a good citizen, to be a good person (role model) in
life, and to make a new generation of intelligence, of knowledge, and
of kindness. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Education makes people criticize more, challenges status quo more,
thus having less confidence in a rosy future for the next 25 year if
things are let be without checks. I think this is actually why many of
those who has received high education don't want to have kids &amp;larr;
not that they have less sexual drive, but they have a deeper
understanding of things, of human, of society, of what the next 25
years may be like, and a stronger will to determine his/her own life,
and a stronger feeling of responsibility when there is a
child. Therefore, education is not the enemy of child birth, nor the
cause of decline of population.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So really, people. &lt;strong&gt;This logic can not be true!&lt;/strong&gt; It's an urban
myth at most. Stop quoting it for your statement. It, in my view, is
FALSE.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;responsibility&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;How can young parents make a condition that if only
State/company/society makes raising a baby easier, I would have had
more kids!???? &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I totally agree, that raising a kid is hard. Yet, we parents also
agree that we love them, wish them the best, though they have brought
us the most frustrating experience, most agonizing moment, most
tiresome nights &amp;amp; days, most anxious episodes.... we regret,
sometimes, sincerely, anger sometimes, uncontrollably, totally at lose
of what to do with them, too many times... yet, we deal with it, try
not to give it up, peddle water to keep head above water, to put out
as much to support them, to give them a good life.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I can use some help, for sure. But it is not a condition. Child is the
result of a love, or a passionate night. She is not a bargain chip,
not a prerequisite &amp;larr; I have always advised young friends to
forget about "I want to get ready before having a kid" &amp;larr; you
simply have no way to &lt;strong&gt;be ready&lt;/strong&gt;. God deals you a child, if he
chooses so, and you deal with it. Period. You can never be ready. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And it becomes even more bizarre that &lt;strong&gt;if society supports the old,
young people can be more creative, more productive&lt;/strong&gt;... are you
fxxxxing kidding me!!??? You might as well just say, you know what, if
only society takes care of all my problems, I'll be a happy man.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Give me break!! Kid, parents, this is all your responsibility. Yes,
responsibility is not fun. But no, without it your life will not be
paradise. On the contrary, I would guess it will be quite miserable
&amp;larr; if your creativity and productivity is depending on so called
social support to such a degree, man, I can bet you are neither
creative nor productive. I guarantee it, because you are nothing but a
selfish, grown-up baby.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;last line&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I haven't been so annoyed and so angry with something like this for a
while. This is really sad. I hate this talk. Honestly, I worry about
China. I think it's going in a direction that people would suffer
greatly. I'm seeing it unfold in front of my eyes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But mostly, I worry about Siqi. She has a full life ahead of her. I
will regret dearly if she were caught in such turmoil someday. I wish
I could have helped her from going through this; I wish I could be
there if the tide comes to her; I wish I could bring her to safety, or
at least, peddle the boat for her, so she will be ok.&lt;/p&gt;</content><category term="thoughts"></category><category term="thoughts"></category></entry><entry><title>Hurricane</title><link href="https://fengxia41103.github.io/myblog/hurricane.html" rel="alternate"></link><published>2018-09-10T16:37:00-04:00</published><updated>2018-09-10T16:37:00-04:00</updated><author><name>Feng Xia</name></author><id>tag:fengxia41103.github.io,2018-09-10:/myblog/hurricane.html</id><summary type="html">&lt;figure class="col l6 m6 s12"&gt;

&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So there is a hurricane coming to NC. The curious thing, however, is
that there is an air of excitement in the air &amp;larr; everybody is
rushing to grocery to stock up food, people calling each other just to
exchange that &lt;code&gt;Costco has run out of water since yesterday&lt;/code&gt;.. actually
now thinking back, I think this same pattern has played out also when
Boston was hit by snow storms, that people were both nervous and
excited.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To think of it, I think this speaks about human psychie. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;First of all, this risk is certainly not really being taken as a risk,
at all. Let me ask you this, if this risk is plainly a risk that you
won't survive if caught in it, will you even feel any chance of "yeah
let's go to buy some bottle water!?" The underline message of this
madness is that all these people are 100% sure that they will survive,
they will be fine, and hardly they even expect their daily convenience
will be interrupted at all &amp;larr; here is my …&lt;/p&gt;</summary><content type="html">&lt;figure class="col l6 m6 s12"&gt;

let's go to buy some bottle water!?" The underline message of this
madness is that all these people are 100% sure that they will survive,
they will be fine, and hardly they even expect their daily convenience
will be interrupted at all &amp;larr; here is my toilet flushing, my
running water so I can take shower, and Netflix works smoothly, maybe
even my 5G is never down so I can update my profile w/ some stormy
pictures... this is nothing but a kid's thriller ride in a theme
park:"ahhhhh....."  splash... all soaking wet, but everybody is
laughing. Doesn't this speak for human's tendency to underestimate
risk, or putting in an encouraging spin, that human is optimistic?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Secondly, excuses. I think human needs excuses, in order to justify
their action, especially the ones that they know themselves that they
are unusual, outliers. For example, everybody is driving in a rush
with a sense of emergency and purpose. How interesting! Everybody is a
on mission, "I need to get to the store" "I need to buy this"... for a
cause that human has no control whatsoever, it is the perfect clause
to give everybody a purpose, instantly. Since no one's action caused
this hurricane, my madness of driving and honking and impatience at
the checkout line is perfectly justified, understood, if not
absolutely expected. Does this speak for built-in self-importance that
everybody has? Yes I think so. Hurricane is a God's act, it's meant to
remind his creation that regardless how much steel you have, you can
be crushed easily with his whip. Yet, the contrary is achieved &amp;larr;
everybody is made important, is feeling important. If God is watching,
he has to be upset, "what the heck!?"&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Third, living for a purpose. Ordinary life is boring,
purposeless. Having a kid gives one a purpose, so each parent acts
with a will of steel. Same when there is a crisis in a scale, a
natural disaster, a war, a movement, a tribal fight..... human needs
something in mind in order to feel life. The day when I have a thought
to write or a diagram to create, I feel good. But how could that be!?
Don't we all hate tasks? when did you ever feel happy when your boss
walks to you and said "here I got you 10 more things to do"!? Then why
having something-to-do actually makes you, excited!? I think at least
there is a different between being excited versus being happy. My
theory is that the excitement raises your energy level so you don't
feel as tired, therefore it appears that you are happier!
Anyway. People need tasks, need to-dos, I think the difference is
tasks that are &lt;code&gt;doable&lt;/code&gt; &amp;amp; &lt;code&gt;I need it anyway&lt;/code&gt;, are ok; the work ones
are the &lt;code&gt;I dont know how to do this either&lt;/code&gt; kind, and that tips people
off.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Fourth, god-send-vacation. This natural disaster must be bad for
business owners. I just watched a girl from nearby Chinese restaurant
walking to grocery and came back w/ nothing in hand. I guess their
business model has been that zero stock of ingredient but re-stock
from this grocery when running low. This is common but how they are
going to operate today when everybody is rushing to this same grocery
to buy out EVERYTHING!?  But for corporate employees, this is really
really good &amp;mdash; no responsibility, no obligation, plenty
possibility down the line, and zero fault! This is free-jail
card. What a relief for everybody when life itself is full of
responsibility and deadlines? You know, I kind of wonder whether we
should call this natural disaster, or a natural holiday!? I vote for
holiday, because it really is.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Fifth,  community feeling.  It has  long  been rumored  that human  is
social animal,  that you feel  better when connected with  other human
beings. The problem,  of course, is that few is  connected to you, and
you are willing to  connect to few. All of sudden,  now everyone is in
this same  group of  &lt;strong&gt;potential victim&lt;/strong&gt; &amp;mdash;  we have  one common
topic to talk, to exchange a few  lines of caring and warm feeling, to
shed a sense of humor in face of &lt;em&gt;danger&lt;/em&gt; (which I have already argued
that this is not taken as danger at  all), and to feel being part of a
&lt;strong&gt;greater something&lt;/strong&gt;. How fascinating!? I have always criticized this
tendency of human  being herded into belief of a  "greater good" which
led to terrible human tragedy, and I have always wished people to have
more  independent thinking.  Yet,  witnessing this  episode proves  to
myself that this is such a built-in character that changing it is like
asking a person to  walk on one leg only when he has  two &amp;larr; it is
entirely  unnatural.  But  is  philosophy  then  a  losing  battle?  I
sincerely wish  not. Yet,  this does highlight  the tragedy  that lies
within, that  human race is  doomed to be  caught by propaganda,  by a
version of a greater good someone preaches... it's like drug, once you
are part  of some group, it's  hard to pull  yourself out of, be  it a
love  relationship, a  team,  a school,  a company,  a  church, or  in
today's scene, a  hurricane. We are eager to  find common denominator,
we are  ready to accept  a denominator, we are  nothing but a  list of
common denominators (this sounds very much like the "who am I, and who
are you" argument I put in &lt;a href="https://fengxia41103.github.io/myblog/social media.html"&gt;social media&lt;/a&gt;).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the end, I went shopping w/ Noah after his Kumon also. The moment I
walked in and saw shelves of green in produce cooler &amp;amp; buckets of
fruits of all kinds (and there are watermelons the size to feed a
family for a week!), well, there isn't really much reason to feel
nervous then &amp;rarr; I can live off a week of vegetables and
fruits. It's good to your health!&lt;/p&gt;</content><category term="thoughts"></category><category term="thoughts"></category></entry><entry><title>Accelerated anonymity</title><link href="https://fengxia41103.github.io/myblog/accelerated%20anonymity.html" rel="alternate"></link><published>2018-09-04T10:42:00-04:00</published><updated>2018-09-04T10:42:00-04:00</updated><author><name>Feng Xia</name></author><id>tag:fengxia41103.github.io,2018-09-04:/myblog/accelerated anonymity.html</id><summary type="html">&lt;p&gt;It feels that everything is converging.

want to feel important, to justify your own being, being valuable,
being &lt;em&gt;smarter than many&lt;/em&gt;, being a good person, being a thinker &amp;larr;
really, just whatever image I want to project of myself, that's the
deep down motives, yet I'm motivated by it exactly because I don't
have it, and chances because I'm not capable of achieving it (thus
don't have it yet), Therefore, the louder I'm speaking in that term,
the louder I'm really announcing to the world that I am not that. How
tragic.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This leads to the topic of what I want to discuss today, what I call
&lt;strong&gt;acclerated anonymity&lt;/strong&gt;. There is a common theme wherever I turn,
that people in society has this anxiety to become &lt;strong&gt;known&lt;/strong&gt;,
recognized, agreed upon. Why!? In this Japanese movie, &lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9us-TZ6aR74"&gt;Tokyo
Story&lt;/a&gt;, a common acknowledgment of price one pays by going to a
big city like Tokyo is that you becomes insignificant, an ant. There are millions
of you out there, doing the same thing, living the same life, thus
yourself becomes a person without identity. This exact same feeling is
being echoed in this generation in China, and perhaps in previous
generations also when people were literally treated as trash and a
part-of some great-good. So tools such as social media becomes
immensely popular because we now have a channel to make yourself seen
and heard, and even applauded. We are all on a stage putting on a
show, and waiting for audience to show up, to admire us, to get some
eyeballs, and to get, if not financial benefit, at least emotional
benefit.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This same logic also intensifies the sensation of love, that out of
this billion people or million people, s/he finds me, and likes me,
and even adores me, what's the odds! what a fate! &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Then, there is marketing, images of a life that feels
ready-to-be-owned if only you put out your credit card, now, painless,
effortless, reasonable, entitled, of course. The book of image
explained well that this is only made possible with advent of mass
production that what used to be available only for the elites and the
rich, is now lowered in price that commoners can afford also, with a
bit alternation in form, in exquisiteness, in quality, in feel, in
originality, in its emotional meaning, and sometimes even in practical
usage. But no matter, there you have it, even as a mockup, as a
counterfeit, as a A货， as 山寨, it's better than none, than nothing
(actually, doesn't this feel like the POC valud I hold so dear!? that
the leap from 0 to 1 is qualitative, while 1-N is
quantitative). Fascinating.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But then, this anxiety, this feeling of not-being-recognized, is
accelerating. Going into a crowd makes you feel small; a growing
population, or just being in a country of large population, highlights
this instantly. So everybody is desperately holding on some identity,
internally and externally, to prove his/her existence. Therefore, the
LV, the vanity, the fashion, the wechat and your fans... but then,
what is the alternative? what is the other extreme? seclusion!? that
doesn't sound good either. And arguably, what about book authors?
those really master pieces, and music, and essays, thoughts,
philosophies... they didn't just write them for their self
entertaining, did they!? They wanted their voice and opinion to be
heard, to be adopted. So can I say they were also just as vain as us
who wants to buy identity with $$? It does seem that we are on equal
footing in this aspect. But theirs are, more complex? more advanced?
more influential? I don't know.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So indeed, this feeling/desire of being somebody is universal and
true. It must be part of a human mind. It's there, and we are born
with it. There is nothing wrong about this anxiety. It's as natural as
eating and shitting, just that it needs to be understood and handled.
My reading of all these phenomenon is that this growing intensity of
becoming known is exactly a mirror image of population expansion, and
progress of large scale coorperation that answers growing complexity
of problem human society is to solve (and doesn't this in turn create
more complex problems? how self-propelling this is!) But then, what
is the other extreme, that a tribe with a handful of residents, you
know everyone by name and their family tree back to a few generations,
even with blood ties all the way back!?  Does it then alleviate or
even remove such desire to &lt;strong&gt;known&lt;/strong&gt;? and also, at least we will agree
that being known is different from being agreed with. But in today's
anonymity, these two are essentially the same motivation &amp;larr; if not
seeking an agreement, then why bother to be known!? Then why, why we
are so eager to seek an agreeing voice? Is it because we just lack
self-confidence? why now? and did we have this crisis in a tribe mode?
What happens that your opinion was not agreed by tribe members? well,
I guess then you will be kicked out, and die, so there is natural
selection at work, haha. But then, today's society is practicing this
same act, that especially in a (closed-minded) society, different opinion
is not welcomed, is surpressed, is to be removed and its owner
silienced and even eliminated &amp;larr; but this should not be justified,
should it!? &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I don't know. &lt;strong&gt;The core has not changed, but the scale has
changed&lt;/strong&gt;. The growth of sheer number of population, the growing
interconnection from tribe to State to now Globalization, the growing
level of coordination in production especially in procurement and
assembly (I still firmly believe the logistics of physical goods are
soooo much more difficult than sending bits over a wire) &amp;rarr; these
are driving what we feel as the acceleration of anonymity.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Is it bad? No. It's annoying, but inevitable. It's what makes our life
better than an ancient king, but also drives us nuts. Just like
everything else, this is another case of built-in contradiction of
existence &amp;rarr; the strength is the weakness, the benefit is the
cost. No escape, always true.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;ah, hope&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Here is a good news &amp;rarr; there is hope!  If you live in &lt;code&gt;middle
income (XP)&lt;/code&gt; countries, you are out of luck because population
is growing; if you are in &lt;code&gt;high income (XD)&lt;/code&gt; countries,
your anxiety has a hope ~~&lt;/p&gt;</content><category term="thoughts"></category><category term="thoughts"></category></entry><entry><title>Too much trust</title><link href="https://fengxia41103.github.io/myblog/too%20much%20trust.html" rel="alternate"></link><published>2018-08-28T17:37:00-04:00</published><updated>2018-08-28T17:37:00-04:00</updated><author><name>Feng Xia</name></author><id>tag:fengxia41103.github.io,2018-08-28:/myblog/too much trust.html</id><summary type="html">&lt;p&gt;It has become a cliché that China nowadays are lacking trust.

&lt;p&gt;That's right. You heard me. Isn't the blind trust that people dive
into whatever the government's policy says, eg. 大众创新， 工业4.0, 人
工智能，大数据, because they argued that the most trustworthy entity
in this society is the government, because, well, you can't trust
anyone else. So authority becomes the last hope to represent
trust. Then, exactly because the same blind trust of so called
&lt;code&gt;knowledge&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code&gt;expert&lt;/code&gt;, even &lt;code&gt;history&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code&gt;book&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code&gt;theory&lt;/code&gt;, and even a
neutral word such as &lt;code&gt;data&lt;/code&gt; (which I have argued in &lt;a href="https://fengxia41103.github.io/myblog/drafts/digit analysis.html"&gt;data digit&lt;/a&gt; &amp;amp;
&lt;a href="https://fengxia41103.github.io/myblog/data and credit score.html"&gt;data &amp;amp; credit score&lt;/a&gt; that China has totally misunderstood, perhaps
intentionally, about the meaning of data, and is actively abusing the
word &lt;code&gt;data&lt;/code&gt; up to what I would simply call an &lt;strong&gt;intellectual crime&lt;/strong&gt;),
that has &lt;strong&gt;misled&lt;/strong&gt; audience astray with or without a dark thought of
manipulation &amp;mdash; with, in the sense that many do know what they
are selling; without, in the sense, that many do believe what they are
selling (and this is infinitely worse because they are becoming
&lt;strong&gt;sincere liers&lt;/strong&gt;).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is not only scary, but outright wrong, and is the root cause of
all these sad, really, sad, reality that is being unfolded in front of
our eyes. Why would I trust a stranger and get into his car? why
should I trust a company who actively advocate that ride is fun
because you can have encounter w/ pretty girl as passenger? why should
I trust government's policy if his track record has shown over and
over and over again that:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;he never admits he did anything wrong&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;he never said "I'm sorry"&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;he changes his mind 180 degrees in many occasions, which had
   brought tremendous headache to your private life &amp;mdash; how about
   the policy of having baby, for one example? and the right to buy a
   house, for another? &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;and hi never discloses his decision making process, nor his budget book.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If taking him as an individual person, I challenge anyone would say,
"you know what!? He is a great guy, let's marry my daughter to him."
So, why should there be &lt;strong&gt;any trust&lt;/strong&gt;!?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Then, all the BS data published, all the BS theory circulating in
wechat and among friends &amp;amp; family, all the BS advice to be long-lived
or just to be healthy.... everything, I do mean everything, should be
challenged, should be criticized, and should be suspected! There isn't
such a thing as TRUST. As a matter of fact, I would say TRUST can only
exist when the foundation is being extremely doubtful, thus extremely
cautious, thus extremely conservative and protective. TRUST only exist
when there is an army of measure to deal with it when it &lt;strong&gt;goes
wrong&lt;/strong&gt; relative to 1 that describes the "right" scenario &amp;larr; like
writing programs, really, the majority of the code is to deal with
conditions or guard conditions that will crash the system, while only
a minor amount will end up being the feature implementation. Follow
this you can even argue that all the code to deal with &lt;code&gt;alternative
course&lt;/code&gt; (in UML's syntax) is part of the feature/requirement itself,
and that's exactly right.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Will you trust a car that have no brake, just because its normal
course/main feature is that it moves forward!? Will you trust
yourself, at all, if there is no hospital/doctor ever, in this world,
because the normal course of life is be in the same state tomorrow
like today, and today like yesterday?... you get the idea. It will be
simply crazy to agree that normal course is all; and it's simply a
crime if normal course is being presented as the ONLY course possible,
available, or advisable.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Then, why the hell you would trust an author and his/her saying while
there is no &lt;em&gt;counter arguments&lt;/em&gt;!? why to trust a data when nowhere in
its analysis it first defines its assumptions? why to trust a
government policy that you can only hear exactly ONE WAY of
&lt;strong&gt;interpretation&lt;/strong&gt;, while in fact NO LANGUAGE in the world, including
math, is capable to do that!? Think about it, even the Bible, which
speaks THE TRUTH, has different ways to read its story and
message. And there it is, a policy rolled out fresh out of oven, is
being viewed without ambiguity, without doubt, without challenge,
without critics, without uproar from somebody, some group &amp;rarr; this
just can not be! This only means one thing, that opinions have been
suppressed, and whoever is promoting this wants you to have one
possible conclusion.  But now since I have laid these out flat, if you
look at this logic chain again, I will be really curious that who
would want to do that to you!?  and who would want to live in that!?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;China needs &lt;code&gt;anti trust&lt;/code&gt;, someone like me, a lot of me. Trust, is a
result, of debate, proof, and clarity; it is not a cause. Whoever
promotes this idea is actually getting it reversed. Well, see, I'm
practicing my own preach here &amp;rarr; I don't trust these guys, don't
take their statement easily. People will find me just annoying, I
guess. But it's ok. I trust my own judgement more than others'. I
trust quite a few authors, whose book and writing, though I don't
understand, I find them intriguing &amp;mdash; &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Social_Contract"&gt;social contract&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Road_to_Serfdom"&gt;the
road to serfdom&lt;/a&gt; &amp;mdash; am I committing the same foolishness that
I'm criticizing here!? No. I trust them, exactly because all these
writings are in tone and in spirit of &lt;strong&gt;do not trust&lt;/strong&gt;!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yes, if you can't be as angry and as annoying as I am, take Reagan's
word for a starter at least:"&lt;strong&gt;Trust, but verify&lt;/strong&gt;".&lt;/p&gt;</content><category term="thoughts"></category><category term="thoughts"></category></entry><entry><title>On Noah's 10th birthday</title><link href="https://fengxia41103.github.io/myblog/on%20noah%2010th%20birthday.html" rel="alternate"></link><published>2018-08-27T11:00:00-04:00</published><updated>2018-08-27T11:00:00-04:00</updated><author><name>Feng Xia</name></author><id>tag:fengxia41103.github.io,2018-08-27:/myblog/on noah 10th birthday.html</id><summary type="html">&lt;figure class="col s12"&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Hard to believe, the guy is 10 years old now. I can still feel the
day, the day that he was coming to this world, and the day it was a
hot summer day, and I was biking between hospital and home. He came at
1pm, the same time when my brother passed away. I joked that he was
him reborn into this family. This gave my moom, and everyone in the
family, a comfort, that he is back to us again, in Noah's body, and
will be loved and cherished and spoiled, as if it is a second chance
for everybody, like a lost, found.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I wanted to believe that myself, too. I missed Lei. It is becoming
less frequent now that I will think of him. But he is still there. I
wish there were more I could have done at the time, to ease his
pain. I wish I had been more mature, more independent, and more
thoughtful, and more wise perhaps, to know what to do, and to do what

wish there were more I could have done at the time, to ease his

is well, and right. Yet, time is indeed a passing river, never stops
for anyone, for any soul... how funny this is! that &lt;strong&gt;time&lt;/strong&gt; is purely
a human invention, yet, we are so at the mercy of it, that we could
only look at it with a deep sigh, and nothing, absolutely nothing, we
can do about it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I told Noah many times that there are many things I can help him with,
but there is one thing nobody can give him more, and that is time. I
was saying so to get him some sense of time. But it is true. Time
flies, life is like a summer, with a flash, the summer of life is
gone. I start to feel the age, start to see that the summer of my life
is at its end, and it does feel rather sad. Then, here is Noah, double
digit now, and this summer has felt really short. People say time
starts to accelerate once kids are growing up. If only, that mine
would stand still, then let theirs go by as quickly as they will,
turning 10 is a big deal I think, because he is now a teen, and he
starts to have a lot of thought of him own these day.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;He is really funny sometimes. So big guy, happy birthday! I don't know
how long I can accompany you. It's God's will, so I wouldn't guess. So
far, I have enjoyed you very much. Though there are endless headaches,
and frustrations, and such. I wouldn't say it's all worth it; it's all
part of you, and I start to accept them, as they are, and I do love
you and care about you very much, as you are.&lt;/p&gt;</content><category term="thoughts"></category><category term="thoughts"></category></entry><entry><title>Technology responsibility</title><link href="https://fengxia41103.github.io/myblog/technology%20responsibility.html" rel="alternate"></link><published>2018-08-16T11:25:00-04:00</published><updated>2018-08-16T11:25:00-04:00</updated><author><name>Feng Xia</name></author><id>tag:fengxia41103.github.io,2018-08-16:/myblog/technology responsibility.html</id><summary type="html">&lt;figure class="col l5 m5 s12"&gt;

&lt;p&gt;What touched me, and got me think today, is Frank said about
technology. He asked technology to think harder how people can use it
in a &lt;code&gt;self-serving&lt;/code&gt; way, and to build a box around it so to circumvent
its abuse. This is quite in the same call that people talk about
facebook fiasco, which I have ranted my view on &lt;a href="https://fengxia41103.github.io/myblog/social media.html"&gt;social media&lt;/a&gt;. It
feels right, and actually I'd like to see it happen. But as an
engineer who implements these technology, I feel challenged.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;it is actually practical&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;First of all, I don't think it is practical to even foresee how people
can abuse your technology. Like when any sharp knife is banned on
airplane after 911. To me, if I'm intending to do harm to people, then
without accessing to a sharp knife becomes an inconvenience, not a
stopper. What about the fork they issued you at lunch? and even a
chord of some sort will be enough to strangle someone. But I also
think this logic is valid, because this is the same for, say, bike
locks, that it doesn't stop bike thief, just makes his stealing
harder, takes longer, thus increasing his risk of being caught, which
in turn deterring him from trying.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Therefore, the prevention logic is not to stop, but to raise the bar
so your determination has to rise higher than before in order to tip
off to the evil side. Yes if you are hardcore, nothing is going to
stop you; well, then, since being a &lt;code&gt;hardcore&lt;/code&gt; is not defined,
quantified, and rare, thus playing w/ human nature of being lazy and
satisfied w/ mediocrity, this strategy will work. Make sense.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;build-in to fail&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But even so, there can be million ways to self-serve my technology,
which, if I were the inventor, can not be held responsible because I
just could not know. Think about kids. Any parent can relate million
stories when kid picks up something and use it in a &lt;strong&gt;creative&lt;/strong&gt; way,
which in adult's eyes it was purely playing w/ fire! We will yell at
the kid, blame the supervising adult, but also like to hear some
apologies from that manufacturer/inventor, for a emotional comfort I
guess. Why so!?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I think underline there is this feeling of &lt;strong&gt;guilt&lt;/strong&gt; when things like
that happen. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Parent feels bad of themselves since they are the one responsible
   for enlightening the kid not to do such thing.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;They also feel bad that their breed turn out to be absent-minded
   adventurer (and don't all parents think their child is the best,
   smartest, or at least we all hope/wish so, even reality speaks
   differently!?), which is against his/her view of their product.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Then, if Eve ate the apple, snake is to be hated, thus the external
   influences &amp;mdash; manufacturers, bad friends, commercials, violent
   movies, and so on.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The apple also appears to be in fault &amp;larr; why are you so
   enticing!? If only you taste just bad, then the kid would not have
   taken attention of you!&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I don't know. I think the chain can go quite long, and you can see
many echos in these chain that, in different story lines, a couple of
these points are manifested to be the top-level significance, but
eventually w/ discussion developed, all these points (and more) will
be linked and derived, so that essentially this loop of logics keep
repeating themselves. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This then raises a question &amp;mdash; if we will drag out all these
points anyway in all the incidents, then we really don't have a clue
of what to blame, and how to solve it then! If borrowing a common
cliche in love scene, that if your relationships always go sore in the
same way &amp;larr; meeting the same type of date, had similar process
then similar breakups, then there is built-ins of you is the cause,
because you are the &lt;strong&gt;common denominator&lt;/strong&gt;! &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Therefore, parallelly, if we always feel these steps in the logic
above when something goes awry, shouldn't it also point to a built-in
feature of you (or the kid) that is actually the common denominator!? &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I think so. It's not the apple, or the snake. It is Eve herself, who
possessed this sense of curiosity stronger than, say, Adam, thus she
is receptive to snake's talk, thus have a lower bar to become her
version of &lt;code&gt;hardcore&lt;/code&gt; &amp;rarr; nothing is going to stop her from tipping
off, if it wasn't the apple, the story will be a pear, or a peach, or,
how about an evil watermelon!?... hahaha....&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;what's the solution&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This leads another conversation. We all talk about social
responsibility, or just responsibility in general. I do think people,
or good people, are responsible people. But then, since we can't not
foresee how a product can be used by bad people, how can I claim to be
a responsible engineer? Are we at mercy of these bad/creative guys who
use our technology for an end which we disagree? and how can we
gain/regain control if we don't like at mercy in others' hands?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the aftermath of WWII, people pleaded for conscience of bad guys
that they lost common sense and committed horrible deeds. But they
also evoked the same logic to defend themselves that their job/task
was but a screw on a giant machine, what's for the screw to know and
to determine this machines does, and to stop it!? There is question
about information &amp;larr; whether screw is made to be aware of the
machine's function, and his role in it; and another question of
capability &amp;larr; that screw can cripple this machine. Both of these,
are easier said than done, and I think that is the reality.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But there is hope, and hope lies in recognition of free information
flow assisted w/ technology. If you look at the question above, the
capability has an underline message that a screw is too small of a
scale in front of machine. Yet, quantity will change it, because the
machine is composed nothing but all these screws! So when 1 screw
changes nothing, 90% of screws can not stop the machine, it can change
this machine into something entirely different, like transformer!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So how to amass quantity? Brain wash, of course, for one. But I will
never agree w/ that, because it is a top-down approach &amp;mdash; an idea
is &lt;strong&gt;imposed upon&lt;/strong&gt; us, not our own ideas bubbling up. The key, is
information free flow. Only by informing this single tiny screw of the
entire machine, of what his role affects the outcome, can the screw
makes a link &amp;mdash; some crew cares, some don't; some makes a link
that is factually right, while others make skewed version &amp;mdash; no
matter! &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Only with this background can one be possible to see result of his
action, even remotely, and start to build a sense of his role and his
effect, and this is the foundation of developing responsibility.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Therefore, technology itself has not right or wrong. It's a tool. User
has built-ins that she can do nothing about, and will manifest on these
tools in a way that was unexpected. That's fine. Human nature, is,
nature. As long as we allow such incidents be reported, evaluated, and
learn to build guards around these past incidents, we are on the path
of becoming responsible. I don't believe there is an end game, like
the ultimate responsibility of some kind, so being on the trajectory
and has the capability to iterate so to approximate an ideal state,
even indefinitely unachievable, is all we need, is all we got. &lt;/p&gt;</content><category term="thoughts"></category><category term="thoughts"></category></entry><entry><title>Social media</title><link href="https://fengxia41103.github.io/myblog/social%20media.html" rel="alternate"></link><published>2018-08-03T21:00:00-04:00</published><updated>2018-08-03T21:00:00-04:00</updated><author><name>Feng Xia</name></author><id>tag:fengxia41103.github.io,2018-08-03:/myblog/social media.html</id><summary type="html">&lt;figure class="col l8 m8 s12"&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The recent downfall of Facebook stock and its data privacy fiasco have
been spectacular, and saddening. People are talking about data privacy
as if it is an evil just releases from Gene's bottle, and of course,
when a giant like Facebook shows a crack, millions are worked up to
bring it dow, for its great tragedy that years later all MBA books and
zillion talks on evolution of technology will have a lot of fun to awe
its audience, and for profiting from such a downfall if only it is so
predictable and exciting, like any revolution that mobs are bringing
down the ruling authority and everyone sees an opportunity to
reshuffle the social deck he or she has been given, and maybe this
time a better card will be in hand.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;All in all, this is a true irony, that the social networking giant is

&lt;p&gt;The recent downfall of Facebook stock and its data privacy fiasco have
been spectacular, and saddening. People are talking about data privacy

when a giant like Facebook shows a crack, millions are worked up to

&lt;p&gt;All in all, this is a true irony, that the social networking giant is
facing a social force that it both created, and in an arena he is the
king.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But really, what I want to talk about is something even more
fundamental than privacy, and more worthwhile to debate and reflect,
if not alarmingly being too little, too late. Because over the last 10
years, the word &lt;code&gt;social networking&lt;/code&gt; has been hailed as the gospel of
the future, but truly this was done more genuinely than what is of
those buzz words flooding the media nowadays such as AI, big data
anaylsys, or sharing economy, since it does touch something core to
human existence, on which I will be discussing in this essay.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Social media and social networking have indeed transformed
communication method that people are device-savy are engaging. Not
only it is convenient to talk to your dad and mom internationally or
nationally; it has become a forum of ideas, opinions, life in a
real-time sense, and manifested and recorded in a degree that has
never happened and possible in the past. One hundred or one thousand
years later historians and researchers will face an overwhelmingly
amount of day-to-day or even minute-to-minute data to reconstruct what
our life in year 2018 is like. No more speculation and guess work from
some books written decades since the even happened, and from debris or
broken pieces of archaeology artifacts to derive/reverse-engineer what
is like. If assuming that data is still readable then, and data is
processable and understandable then, then this generation must be the
one that has been mostly documented, recorded, manifested as if
everyone is on a stage, hunger for information and for attention.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I'm not a fan of posting my life, nor a fan seeing alerts/updates of
someone I know has just left for lunch, or having a cup of coffee,
everyday at this time. But it' ok if you like to make your life known,
however the side you choose to show, prefer to be remembered, and
be eager to run away from. I have no problem with this at all. But
there is other things of social networking that I feel deserve much
attention, which unfortunately has not been given by media, by public,
by private citizen, by everyone whose reference of daily life and
meaning is being changed by them.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;torturing yourself&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Watching any wechat user, or any of the 13 billion Chinese
walking on the street, standing on escalator, sitting somewhere,
eating, riding a subway, climbing stairs, dating with friends,
gathering with family, participating a meeting, talking to client or
boss or whoever, toileting... if driving and texting is bad, then I
think shitting and wechatting is disgusting, disturbing, humiliating,
bizzare, degrading, unhealthy, and utterly covering your beloved phone
with germs and god knows what, and for no good reason whatsoever.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Because if you are only willing to take one step back out of this
&lt;strong&gt;fantastic high&lt;/strong&gt; of constant suspension (yes indeed this is the
suspense movie you are starring!), I highly suspect any part of your
life is living such a cutting edge and importance that it can not be
missed, even for a few minutes. Really, even God rests on Sunday, whom
do you think you are!?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This level of &lt;strong&gt;anxiety&lt;/strong&gt;, yes, if you are a social networking user,
&lt;strong&gt;you are anxious&lt;/strong&gt;, is just bizzare! This is worse than mid-age
crisis, because it does not care whether your true age is mid or
not. The anxiety to see a response to your &lt;code&gt;message in a bottle&lt;/code&gt; is
getting to your nerve &amp;mdash; oh mine mine mine, did s/he say
something to my post? ... oh nothing yet... &amp;lt;20 seconds later&amp;gt;
.... didn't I feel the phone just lighted up? there is new
message!....&amp;lt;20 seconds later&amp;gt;... maybe it's here now... I'm always
watching such strange reality show with an urge to laugh and to pity
&amp;mdash; at the end of day, why put yourself through such a misery by
torturing yourself with anxiety, by caring so much how others react to
you, how they comment on a conversation, how they view your activity,
how they think about you, how they like or dislike you!?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I understand the argument that as a social member, as all human are
meant to be one, and gively I agree with this statement, thus a person
must care about others' view of you, makes a kind gesture to fit in,
and be a good citizen &amp;larr; it's duty, built-in requirement, thus
inevitable, necessary, and justified.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I get it. I'm not against human society, relationship, even though I'm
quite anti-social these days that I don't enjoy hanging out with
people I don't enjoy hanging out with, and I don't give a fxxx who the
fxx this person is if s/he is someone I'm interested in knowing, am
happy to be with, and am willing to have a relationship. But really,
often than not I think this argument is only &lt;strong&gt;borrowed&lt;/strong&gt; by the
person to justify his checking-my-phone-every-20-seconds
behavior. &lt;strong&gt;Fundamentally, s/he take herself/himself too seriously.&lt;/strong&gt;
Universe is rotating around her, thus if you have not yet responded to
her message, you must be composing it as we speak, or must be
digesting her meaningful words and formulating a reply in
mind... either way, your mind is occupied by this input, and should
display CPU 100% on all cores, and all memory used up!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But the reality is, how many people in your life you would care so
much!? I know one, and you probably have, whatever, a few, a
dozen?.... it won't be many, that's the point, because if there are
many, then you are either playing a God's role, or you are treating
them equally shittyly, because you don't know what &lt;strong&gt;care means&lt;/strong&gt;. So,
now take a flip side of this, how many would consider you as that
person s/he cares!? Equally, the odds is pretty low. So really, if you
feel otherwise, either you are in love, or you are in a high and
refusing to wake up.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is not some dark theory I'm proposing on human. This is how human
emotion is &amp;mdash; emotion is an expansive item to have, it take s
tremendous energy, space, life. Most of us so called common people
simply have no such capacity to create that much caring and love that
can drive and support the type of &lt;strong&gt;anxious-of-your-response&lt;/strong&gt;
pattern! We just can't, and will not.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Therefore, bringing such an anxiety on yourself is completly rootless,
and can only be viewed as a sign of poor judgement of yourself, your
social networking participants, and the word &lt;code&gt;relationship&lt;/code&gt; in general.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;slowing down your brain&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Another effect of social media, and enabled by technology, is that
your day is becoming a long list of &lt;code&gt;[20, 20, 20, 20......]&lt;/code&gt; (in
seconds). Not only the anxiety and disappointment of not seeing a
response tortures your mind, this pattern forces your brain to
constantly doing a &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Context_switch"&gt;context switching&lt;/a&gt; &amp;larr; ask your IT friend,
if he is worth his salt, he will know the conclusion, that &lt;strong&gt;context
switching is expansive&lt;/strong&gt;. It is necessary, but any designer will show
his smartness by avoiding unnecessary switching whenever
possible. This is not just a technical talk of optimization; this is
basic principle, because at the end of day, your brain is what defines
you, no one yet I know of is willingly to be called "slow", or
"stupid", and we often laugh at animals such as Dash (Zootopia)
because he reacts slooooooooowly!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Then why the heck you want to slow down your brain by forcing it to
context switching every 20 seconds!!!!????&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Isn't this, stupid, or what!?
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;prisoner of diversity&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Have your noticed, heard, and must have experienced, that by so called
&lt;code&gt;user profiling&lt;/code&gt; backed by big data analysis and AI, that on one hand
you don't need to bother with Amazon search much at all, since all the
products you bought, often buy, likely to be interested, aligned with
your shopping cart history, derived from what they know about your
needs, your taste, your life, are right there! How convenient!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Then, at the same time, Youtube becomes static, any recommendation of
the sort described above becomes, &lt;strong&gt;STATIC&lt;/strong&gt;. You are seeing
recommendations as your top choice, and the more you choose from them,
well, the stronger a belief that you do like this type of stuff!
&amp;rarr; this is becoming &lt;strong&gt;completly self-propelling and
self-fullfilling&lt;/strong&gt;!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This actually proves a point I have longed to state, that when
information becomes overwhelmingly abundant, a person will be
saturated (again, see my brain analysis in previous section), thus his
only method to handle this is to &lt;strong&gt;limit inputs&lt;/strong&gt;, thus we are seeing
proliferation of the &lt;strong&gt;reader's digest of book club&lt;/strong&gt; dressed in name
of condensed information (or even more shamelessly, educator in a 21st
form, give me a break!!), and also, profiling. Both share the same
characteristics that &lt;strong&gt;please make a decision for me&lt;/strong&gt; &amp;mdash; you
know, I'm not sure they are doing anything wrong while writing this
line, because I suspect human, or most people, are just lazy, they
don't like to think, to explore. I think this is explained by my
context switching argument above!!! How nice!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So well, my point is that these so called recommendations and
what-you-know-about-me (even-better-than-myself!) urban myth, are
putting us into a prison of diversity of views. Our inputs are
converging, willingly and unknowingly, thus our outputs will also
converge, which re-inforces &lt;strong&gt;the legitimacy of those choices given to
us, not chosen by us&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you enjoy anxiety, this is actually something worth feeling anxious
about &amp;mdash; that we are losing not only the ability to choose, but
the options to choose from. In today's social networking high, we are
feeling not too few, but too many choices. But if not careful, this
exactly fact is driving us into the other extreme, that we will still
have more than ever to choose from, just they are becoming the same!!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Remember Ford's T-model? that we can make it any color you want, as
long as it is black.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Wow.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;who am I, and who are you&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If I have not scared you up to this point, there is one more thing
that social networking has done a wonderful job that is even more
spectacular than smashing your waking time to pieces &amp;mdash; it has
smashed yourself into pieces.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Every person is a unity of God knows how many different persons in one
body &amp;mdash; there is part of you who loves badminton, another part
who loves music, another who loves books, another who loves woman or
man or whatever, another who enjoys computer, another who loves
family, another who cares your ex girlfriend(s), ..... you get the
picture. There isn't, has never been, a single YOU. There has always
been a bundle of different you, that is being simplified, labeled as,
you.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What the social networking does is to bubble these sides of you up and
manifest them so that now you are member of a history group because
you all love reading history books, a member of the kids club because
all of your kids are rising 4th grade, a member of this interest
group, a member of that, a member of ..... so what used to be a blob
of blur, a feel and a preference that is fuzzy, hard to define and
hard to describe, now social networking computers have built abstracts
and database models to define them precisely and accurately (remember,
they know better of yourself than you do), and all these sides are now
clearer than ever, almost even defined, and certainly visible, and you
are actively aware of their existence.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While you are excitingly discovering yourself and finding it
satisfying that these many sides of you have all found its groups, you
have also submitted yourself to be re-defined in a modular
fashion. The good news is that this is exactly how dating app works,
that you fill in a form to describe you, and computer uses these
&lt;code&gt;attributes&lt;/code&gt; of you to match for literally a &lt;code&gt;percentage&lt;/code&gt; of
similarity &amp;mdash; you two have 80% in common in term of hobbies! wow,
very likely you will like each other! Actually, this, if not
deciphering the mystery of LOVE, is helping to improve the odds of
initial success (well, initial is hard, but a success in marriage is
much much harder, and odds by looking at court filings doesn't look
encouraging).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But then, what is a marriage anymore, if I'm only loving the 20% of
you!? or even 80%, 90%!? What about the 10% left!? Do I seek to
satisfy that &lt;em&gt;outside the marriage&lt;/em&gt;? Is it then justified for me or
for you to do so? After all, look, math is pretty clear here, 100%
overlapping is an impossibility, so we all have to live with a gap
here &amp;mdash; this actually feels right, because we have all know that
no one is perfect, and some will even take this further to state that
no one is perfect for you... haha....&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Well, so when I talk you next time, or work with you, or having a
coffee, which part of you am I talking to? looking at? having a
relationship with? Do I even need to ask or confirm or request that a
particular side of you is the one I want to talk to, to love, to care?
and even with such possibility, what if you disagree, but willing to
give me the "I love fashion" side of you to be with my "let go for a
movie" side of me!? Is this a mismatch? or just fine?
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is just, weird.&lt;/p&gt;</content><category term="thoughts"></category><category term="thoughts"></category></entry><entry><title>A dream</title><link href="https://fengxia41103.github.io/myblog/a%20dream.html" rel="alternate"></link><published>2018-07-20T10:33:00-04:00</published><updated>2018-07-20T10:33:00-04:00</updated><author><name>Feng Xia</name></author><id>tag:fengxia41103.github.io,2018-07-20:/myblog/a dream.html</id><summary type="html">&lt;figure class="col s12"&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I had a dream, as vivid as it can be, that I was walking next to
you. You were wearing the black dress, the one you look so refined and
elegant in. I reached out to your hand, but you retrieved it inside
your sleeve, and only after a couple tries that I was able to hold it
in mine. I couldn't tell whether you were happy or not. You were
probably reluctant.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But, at the moment, I felt so happy. It was like something long lost
found, well, it is, a person long lost, found. Then I woke up. 2:30 in
the morning. I wanted to text you to tell you that I have a dream of
you, again, and it hasn't been there fore a while, and I was really
scared that you stopped coming to my dream. Now you are there, again.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But, I didn't. It's really a struggle for me whether I should continue
to be present in your life, or should disappear altogether so that you
could have yours …&lt;/p&gt;</summary><content type="html">&lt;figure class="col s12"&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But, I didn't. It's really a struggle for me whether I should continue
to be present in your life, or should disappear altogether so that you
could have yours without any concern of me. I always think the latter
is better, better for you. But then, what am I to judge what's better
or worse? am I playing the God's hand again? I always have this
tendency to put myself in a superior position as if I am the wise one
that knows what's better. Well, not that I'm being arrogant or over
self-confident. I actually feel this way because I care so much, want
to make the best of, and wish the best for. And yet, everytime, it
comes out in such a negative way, at the receiving end anyway, that I
felt discredited, unfair, and disappointed. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Why? I can only think that it  must be me, the only common denominator
in all  these cases,  that must  have something  wrong, a  low emotion
intelligence, a  blant attitude, or  just arrogance but myself  is not
seeing it.  However,  I know I didn't do anything,  say anything, with
any  intention  to be  misguiding,  looking  down on  ppl,  lecturing,
prejudicial, let alone lie or manipulative.  I will just kill myself I
ever fell  into the spell  of being someone  who lie or  is dishonest,
because I will be disgusted by myself  so much I couldn't be live with
myself anymore.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I miss you. Yes, I do, many many many times. I tried to hide your from
my mind,  so you could live  in a space  in me that is  not disturbed,
quiet, safe,  and sweet. Yet, there  you are, always stroll  out, many
times a day,  not a word, not a  sound, not a smile or a  cry, but you
are there. I talk to you, somehow,  sometimes of things I just did and
thought I did it  well, so want you to feel proud, to  say "I know you
are  the best";  sometimes just  sadness,  moments I  don't feel  like
seeing anyone else, talking to anyone else, just you, being there, the
only one I still have a wish to talk to, about things that saddens me,
bothers me.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And this dream, feels so real, so real. I don't know whether you felt
anything at that moment. Were you sleeping then? Did you hide your
hands in your sleeves and didn't want to give it to me? and did you
come along to walk by my side?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I don't  know where you  are anymore. It's ok  that none of  these has
been true, it's ok  it's a dream that it disappears when  I wake up. I
still feel it,  as real as it  could be, as wonderful as  it could be,
because it had you, in it.&lt;/p&gt;</content><category term="thoughts"></category><category term="love"></category></entry><entry><title>Not feeling well, today</title><link href="https://fengxia41103.github.io/myblog/not%20feeling%20well%20today.html" rel="alternate"></link><published>2018-07-13T10:50:00-04:00</published><updated>2018-07-13T10:50:00-04:00</updated><author><name>Feng Xia</name></author><id>tag:fengxia41103.github.io,2018-07-13:/myblog/not feeling well today.html</id><summary type="html">&lt;figure class="col s12"&gt;

I have walked out of their life. Maybe she feels that way, too. But
then I know I didn't. I didn't mean to, and I did what I said I would,
I didn't lie or being insincere about the future and how we could

cared, but I meant to get myself ready so I could do what I committed
to do.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But sometimes I feel it was taken in the wrong way, or maybe it was
just timing and pressure and temptation and everything else. There

&lt;p&gt;But there is one thing I can always look at myself into the eyes, or
God's when I'm in the death bed, that I was honest to myself, to her,
to 米粒儿 &amp;amp; 米答应. I had never thought of anything that could mean to
be harm them in any way. How could I? Seeing her cry was the hardest
thing, and I don't want that to happen anymore, ever. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I don't know. Maybe I did leave. But I left everything good about me,
there. I have nothing left I'm feeling proud of. I don't know what I
will be, dying alone perhaps. But that doesn't scare me a bit. Yes,
death is a relief, a closure. I would wish to see them again, to see
the smiles, the laughs, the meows and goofy moves, the song you sang,
and the talents that I have so admired and wished for your success and
happiness.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Like this lovely silly cat, it always brightens my day, like you have
done, to my life.&lt;/p&gt;</content><category term="thoughts"></category><category term="love"></category></entry><entry><title>Waste of mind</title><link href="https://fengxia41103.github.io/myblog/waste%20of%20mind.html" rel="alternate"></link><published>2018-07-12T17:13:00-04:00</published><updated>2018-07-12T17:13:00-04:00</updated><author><name>Feng Xia</name></author><id>tag:fengxia41103.github.io,2018-07-12:/myblog/waste of mind.html</id><summary type="html">&lt;figure class="col l3 m6 s12"&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Wow, this is quite unbelievable! I read a line:"A mind is a terrible
thing to waste." (looking it up, there is an &lt;a href="https://www.npr.org/sections/codeswitch/2013/06/14/191796469/a-mind-is-a-terrible-thing-to"&gt;NPR&lt;/a&gt;!) yes I have
always remembered this line, because it is so true &amp;mdash; despite
that I have been losing faith of human being in general, I do consider
a mind, well, regardless it is doing good or evil, is a terrible thing
to waste. After all, I think the mind is the one only thing that human
may come out of his own misery. Reading books always gives me this,
false hope maybe, that once a while, just about everything goes into
darkness, there is some mind, somewhere, somehow, wired so
differently, that sparks a light, that gives, hope.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The recent movie of &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dying_to_Survive"&gt;"Dying to Survive"&lt;/a&gt; is another case in point,
that goods came out of something so original, so humble, so remote

&lt;p&gt;Well, before I started this article, I was actually going to make a
fun of this news I just came across, that "陕西省社科联经研究决定开展
“梁家河大学问”课题研究", because my first reaction is, what a waste of
mind! But then, why wouldn't such nose browning aldo derive something
worthwhile? What's the difference between the drive to propose such
research versus peddling something legal or illegal just to make
money? If we don't understand how these are different, how do I know I
don't step over the &lt;em&gt;line&lt;/em&gt; someday myself, and wasted the mind I have?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I don't  have an  answer. Somehow I  do have a  gut feeling  that this
drive is quite  different from just an  urge to make money.  It is not
greed... well, not a greed of $$, but can we say it's a greed of fame?
of &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Social_capital"&gt;social  capital&lt;/a&gt;? and don't  these greed  all converge to  be a
greed of $$ at the end anyway? hmmm... this is worth looking into, how
do we categorize  greeds!? and what are the inter-links  among them? I
think the older I  get, the clearer I start to  realize that these bad
words/concepts should  not be avoided.  Instead, we should  look right
into its  eyes, with fear  and uncertainty maybe, but  nonetheless, to
face it, so  you can watch, study,  maybe figure out how  strong it is
really, and  start to  see a  strategy to break  it down  into smaller
tasks so to defeat it, if we really think it's a bad thing to exist.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Without further due, here is the 17 research topics:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It's not easy to produce proposals for such a dry topic (IMHO). But
well, I have to admire their capability to tolerate the BS, to even
think in this BS fashion, internalize this BS, and become thoughtful
enough to put such concept together.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Wow, I guess theirs minds are probably even smarter than mine. With
that endurance and persistence, they could certainly do wonderful
things, be successful and all that. And here they are, putting their
mind into a study of these topics, certainly the prospective of where
to start is totally beyond me. But as a human member, they have
demonstrated an incredible character in spending energy and mind on
something as arcane, uninteresting (to me at last) as these topics, I
have to say, like the twins of greed, this sheds a hope on us &amp;larr;
who knows, somewhere, someone, will use this same character on
something, good, and we will all be thankful then.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So I think, there isn't a waste of mind, as long as your mind is
working on something, and better be something boring, hard, no one
likes to bother type. Even by just absorbing yourself into these so
you don't let loose your brain power on something truly terrible, like
crimes, then you are still doing the society a favor.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What a bizzare logic this is!&lt;/p&gt;</content><category term="thoughts"></category><category term="thoughts"></category></entry><entry><title>Development</title><link href="https://fengxia41103.github.io/myblog/development.html" rel="alternate"></link><published>2018-07-05T21:52:00-04:00</published><updated>2018-07-05T21:52:00-04:00</updated><author><name>Feng Xia</name></author><id>tag:fengxia41103.github.io,2018-07-05:/myblog/development.html</id><summary type="html">&lt;p&gt;This is a quite fascinating argument, and quite unexpected when I'm

&lt;blockquote&gt;

stand  on  popular  but  treacherous ground.  One  reason  eradication

becomes superficially plausible if you  assume that development is the
social objective, axiomatically to be  considered good, by which other

contributed  during  a   normal  life  span  to   the  gross  national
product. If he dies prematurely the  years of useful labor cut off are
lost and consistute a social cost. If  he is by a measurable amount of
his assumed potential. And that is  economic loss. All these costs may
be charged  to a  malaria if  malaria is the  villain, along  with the
direct  expenses  of  treatment,  and  weighed  against  the  cost  of
eliminating the disease or reducing it by any given amount.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If the  model predicts that  fighting disease pays, then  the exercise
can seem as harmless as it  ought to seem superfluous. But suppose the
fight  is  found  not  to  pay.  As  the  whole  point  of  running  a
cost-benefit model is to sway governments presumed to be responsive to
that kind of  argument, would they not be under  as strong pressure to
forgo malaria  control when the  model lights  turn red as  to proceed
when they are green?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Unpleasant as  is that proffered  choice, in the name  of economic
reason, to buy or not to buy lives, there is still a more unpleasant
middle ground: To buy certain  lives and sacrifice others&lt;/strong&gt;. WHO has
come  perilously  close to  recommending  that  governments do  just
that. As a  limited war against malaria by  definition cannot extend
to  the  protection  of  all  people, a  suggested  strategy  is  to
concentrate  on protecting  those people  in society  whose economic
contributions are most important  &amp;mdash; workers in key industries,
producers of  cash crops, those who  labor to build roads,  dams and
other capital  improvements, in short  all those who are  useful for
development.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This implies a curious and dismaying  reversal of values. It used to
be argued  that development  was a good  thing because  it benefited
people; now we seem on the point  of agreeing to have blushed at the
implication  that  human  life  was  to  be  protected  only  as  it
contributed to the gross national  product. No politician appears to
have protested  the cynicism  thus imputed to  political leadership.
Everyone is busy  being "realistic."  &lt;strong&gt;If you want to  do good in a
world so obsessed with development that  it allows only two kinds of
nation, the  developed and  the developing, you  have to  prove that
doing good is one way to develop&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Failure  of the  idea  of mosquito  eradication has  in  truth left  a
vacuum.  Nations such  as  India, that  came such  a  long way  toward
abolishing the  ancient malarial scourge,  do not want it  back; their
governments in fact have no real  political choice but to continue the
fight.  Yet the  warriors remain  disprited,  badly in  need of  fresh
purpose.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It may  be that the most  damaging legacy of eradication  has been the
mental conditioning  it fostered.  The eradicators  developed military
minds: The game, they thought, must go to  them or to us, win or to be
defeated.  But there  were skeptics  of the  eradication strategy  all
along who  protested that  this was  not the real  choice in  the real
world where man habitually copes with recurrent and perennial problems
that he  can never hope  to resolve  and put away  forever. Protecting
ourselves against  the malarial  plasmodium can  be accepted  as quite
probably a task for all tiime without being daunted by the prospect.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Malarial  fighters  have been  a  mercurial  lot, subject  to  intense
enthusiasms  and deep  discouragements. Yet  their own  history should
hearten them.  Unless The  End is finally  here, current  doldrums are
also  part  of   that  history,  they  are   therefore  interlude  not
culmination.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So in name of development, as it is another "-ism", those that do not
benefit the course of it will be deemed unworthy. Again, I found
emphasis on individual, value and right of an individual, is
constantly being challenged, if not at all denied, by these "in the
name of &lt;fill in your label&gt;" &lt;em&gt;beliefs&lt;/em&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I  recall  listening to  Jeffery  Sachs  at  BU  when he  argued  that
perpetual progress is  neither possible nor practical  &amp;mdash; even if
we believe in that universe is inifite, traveling straight towards one
direction will  only bring us back  to where we are.  Economy progress
and development can not go upwards  forever, and I think his point was
that it should not, either. Implication is not only that all resources
on earth will not be enough to support everyone living like Americans,
but this story  of malaria highlighted another aspect  when things are
viewed in a cost-benefit model.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Written in  1978, this argument  has yet convinced mass  to reconsider
the path we are  on, achievements we yearn for, value  of life (as the
Chinese have gone through mania of the  age of success in the last few
years, when preaching of success was  the talk of the day), whether we
can only  go forward, in  a forever  motion of moving  faster, growing
bigger, richer.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I  don't know  whether there  is  a cap  of  human society,  be it  in
population,  in wealth,  in  resource consumption,  in creativity,  in
imagination,  in  invention of  disaster,  in  fostering bias  and  in
correction of  faults.... In theory  I would  think there is  an upper
limit. I'm just living at the tip of its early phase, I suppose. There
is a long way to go, I hope.  &lt;/p&gt;</content><category term="thoughts"></category><category term="thoughts"></category></entry><entry><title>China witness</title><link href="https://fengxia41103.github.io/myblog/china%20witness.html" rel="alternate"></link><published>2018-07-02T13:54:00-04:00</published><updated>2018-07-02T13:54:00-04:00</updated><author><name>Feng Xia</name></author><id>tag:fengxia41103.github.io,2018-07-02:/myblog/china witness.html</id><summary type="html">&lt;p&gt;I have seen this &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/China-Witness-Voices-Silent-Generation/dp/0307388530"&gt;book&lt;/a&gt; on Reader's Corner's shelf for sometime,

predicts that you will then settle on the next one, the mid-range one,
that he is actually selling, which he already knew since the very
beginning. What the hell.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But then, I bought the book, read it, and felt deeply sad inside. Not
that those personal stories were interesting, probably remote, to my
experience. After all, that's a generation or two of which I had
little sense of, heard only some from my own family accounts through
dad and uncles, and had always felt distant, almost repulsed to
absorb, since that age of darkness was too heavy to think about, too
depressing to dig in, and don't we also secretly believe/hope that it
is not going to happen again anyway, so might as well not to burden
yourself with those information.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But then, there  was a clip or  two, that caught me to  think, to feel
disturbed, to  feel really really sad.  I wish there were  also hope I
felt. But  I have to  say there was much  more sadness than  any other
emotions. It's not a sadness of a lost love or a lost generation or of
their suffering. I can't describe what  it is, it is a profound anger,
perhaps, now to think of it, and  a feeling of sorry for that they had
to twisted and turned  and made the best out of what  they had (or was
given)  so  to survive,  yes,  just  survive, not  flourishing,  just,
survive.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Life is hard, for every single generation. There are always one or two
the &lt;em&gt;lucky&lt;/em&gt;  ones, but  overall, it  is hard.  So religion  comes into
play, so  is any kind  of thing that gives  you comfort so  to balance
hardship. It's  funny that  even yesterday  when I  dropped Noah  at a
local Chinese church for his first, and mine too, Sunday school, and I
was dragged into a newbie session in which a senior member (I guess he
is, though I  have no clue how  the ranking system works  in a church)
was discussing w/ three  of us (two were a couple  and the woman works
at Lenovo,  too!), and her  question was, religion is  probably needed
because  people need  something  to help  go  through life's  hardtime
&amp;rarr; a psychological need.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On the one hand, I think everybody would just agree w/ her point,
because this is such a universal ask. On the other hand, I also feel
seeking it is then a challenge, if not a impossibility, because there
are so many to choose from (and doesn't each one clams they are the
true one, while others are just plain false!?), but without a
reference, how can one choose? Oh well. I'll leave this to another
discussion later.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here, I want to jog down a few sections from this book, which, while
reading them, gave me a moment of, silence.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;Page 199, "Tea houses and news singers"&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Sitting opposite Old Mr Wu, the "written complaint" he had paid
someone to write on his behalf clutched in my hands, my heart
ached. These peasants who thought that young Westerners in fashionable
"begging jeans" were poor, and that doing hard, ill-regarded labour in
the city was to "enjoy life and make big money", did not even have the
basic information or understanding they needed to live in the same
era. But they had never made demands for a better life ot the rich and
powerful who requsitioned them into bankruptcy. Yet those "mother and
father officials" who have survived until today only because the
peasants kept to their work instead of throwing down their hoes to
make revolution and class struggle apparently never paused in their
daily banquets to consider the price the peasants have paid with their
blook and sweat.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;China's peasants have been treated as a part of the 10,000 things of
nature, a group that nobody notices. People are concerned about the
melting of the ice caps, they fret over the disappearance of the Asian
tigers, they fume at the desert swallowing up the green lands, they
even have interminable discussions over the right combination of
vitamins ofr every dish of food. But how man people are calling out
for an improvement in the living conditions of the Chinese peasants?
How many people pause to consider the bowls of weak vegetable soup in
China's poverty-stricken villages, with just a few grains of rice
added to stave off hunger? How many people would go to read a story
like "The Gourd Children" or "The Monkey King" to the children of poor
farmers who don't even know which end to open a book at or where to
start reading from on the page, so that those hearts, whose first
awareness was of days and nights of hunger, cold and disease, can have
their share of goals and beautiful memories like the rest of us? How
many people realise that helping those poverty-stricken, uneducated
peasants begins with wresting power from local officials who in turn
have no education and simply do not understand the law?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;China has become strong, China has stood up, but we cannot stand on
the shoulders of the peasants for the world to admire how tall we
are. We cannot let the peasants' blood and sweat water the tree of our
national pride.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;CLEANER: Yes, all of them, even the new ones they've just hung
up. It's just that one over the soap dispenser, there's a mark on the
man's face, I can't get it off.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;MANAGER: Don't you srub that off, I put that tape over the man's eyes
myself. Whatever were they were thinking of, hanging a picture of a
man in a ladies' toilet? How come the floor in that cubicle isn't
shiny?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;CLEANER: I've just mopped it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;MANAGER: Not hard enough, you should mop the floor until you can see
the face of the person in the next toilet!
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;&amp;mdash; Zhengda Shopping Center, Shanghai, 12 May 2007:&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;YOUNG WOMAN: This bran's no good!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;YOUNG MAN: It looks really great on you.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;YOUNG WOMAN: What do you know about it? Nobody takes this brand
seriously. I'll crash and burn in the interview, for certain!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;YOUNG MAN: Well, can't you wear that one from Next?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;YOUNG WOMAN: That brand's too old-fashioned &amp;mdash; as soon as the
boss sees it he'll know that I'm behind the times.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;YOUNG MAN: Things are really expansive here, and money's tight for me
this month.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;YOUNG WOMAN: So do you really love me?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;YOUNG MAN: Of course I love you!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;YOUNG WOMAN: Do you? Then you couldn't let me show up in the clothes
that aren't even brand names and lose face in front of a foreign
boss, now, could you?
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;Page 417&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Closing paragraphs.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;These voices mostly come from the younger generation, I guess, because
most of their parents and grandparents don't know how to use a
computer &amp;mdash; they are a generation who know, instead, of civil
war, political madness, and queuing for food. In seeing those young
Chinese united in such a way, in their care, their outrage and
national pride, I realise I may be wrong about them. I used to think
that they were too comfortable and too rich to understand China's
hungry past, or those poor, uneducated peasants and the misunderstood
last generations.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;All of this made me think of that song "Dyed with my Blood", again:
why does the national flag have to be painted with Chinese blood? I
pray for my motherland &amp;mdash; I hope there will be peasce and
strength, rooted in love and happy families, and with friends around
the world.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;img src="images/simpson.jpg"/&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I have been thinking, is generalization good, or bad, or inevitable? I
kinda of wonder that looking at something, especially something new,
in a generalized term, is actually inevitable. Watching Noah learning
things since young, he has to generalize things in order to recognize
anything &amp;mdash; this is a dog, that is a cat. Over the weekend I got
a few mosquito bites which annoyed me to hell. Then I was thinking
about the book I picked up last week, something about the history of
Malaria, which to many runs that mosquito is spreading virus, thus if
we could eliminate mosquito entirely (as a specie), then we are good.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Well, then I was thinking, among that gazillion mosquitoes, are we now
just  viewing ALL  of them  as a  single identity,  a unified  blob of
living thing with a set of common  traits, and how many of us have any
idea how many  mosquitoes out there!? I bet there  are many. Then, how
many among  them are  actually the  cause Malaria?   I don't  know.  I
challenge anyone …&lt;/p&gt;</summary><content type="html">&lt;figure class="col s12 center"&gt;

many among  them are  actually the  cause Malaria?   I don't  know.  I
challenge anyone around  me knows that. Then, we human  being view ALL
of them an enemy in a bio  warfare, and targeting to kill them all (at
least on a conceptual level. I  think the biologist who are developing
human side of the weaponry actually do have some idea of which type of
mosquito is good &amp;amp; which is bad.)  S case in point, this is exactly we
can comprehend things,  anything, because our capacity  simply can not
incorporate all  the details in order  to track and distinguish  at an
individual  level. Therefore,  the  only way  to  build a  "knowledge"
(quote on purpose) is to generalize.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This  same  is happening  actually  in  my  work.  When I'm  proud  of
&lt;em&gt;building a data model&lt;/em&gt; through analysis,  I always thought in term of
&lt;em&gt;attributes&lt;/em&gt; so that a set of  attributes become a representation of a
thing &amp;mdash; a car, a user, a server. These are data models, and they
are abstracts which &lt;strong&gt;approximate&lt;/strong&gt; the  real thing, but will never be
as real as the real thing, because  we know from the beginning that we
are not going to,  and simply can not (and I mean  this not because we
are  lazy, but  we  do NOT  have the  tool  &amp;mdash; language,  syntax,
methodology, to describe them in an OVERALL fashion! Honestly, I don't
know what such a description will look like in my wildest dream!  It's
just   beyond  me   at   this  moment!)   include   all  details   and
possibilities. Thus,  a model is,  as I  have always said,  a personal
view, an opinion if you will, of  this thing &amp;mdash; I many abstract a
car into a shell, 4 wheels, a steering wheel, and so forth; but we all
know that first  of all, kids always  don't view car in such  a way at
the  beginning  (eventually they  conform  w/  our views,  but  that's
completely drilled into their head by us, not their organic view). And
secondly,  this  exactly  abstract  of  a  car  becomes  a  force  our
imagination has  to battle in  order to  &lt;em&gt;think outside the  box&lt;/em&gt;! Why
does car have to  have 4 wheels? or wheels at  all?... a dominant view
becomes a convention, a convention becomes a rule, a rule becomes both
a guide that has proven to work, and a cat who constantly patrolls its
territory  looking  for  intrusion  to fight  off  &amp;larr;  this  isn't
inspired by some dark human nature. This  is logic, and I can see this
logic has played in the past, is  playing now, and will play again and
again and again,  in different forms and spaces and  contexts, but the
same logic, over and over.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But  then, such  abstract, which  =  learning =  knowledge, is  really
problematic,  and this  is tightly  related to  technology. NPR  talks
about policy  uses &lt;em&gt;profiling&lt;/em&gt;  (based on  data analysis)  to identify
candidates to monitor, who essentially is said (by algorithm!) to have
higher probability to commit a crime. Well, this is easily understood,
from both  a conventional  wisdom point  of view  and a  data analysis
POV.  What comes  into  the  play is  the  word  &lt;code&gt;history&lt;/code&gt; (or  &lt;code&gt;track
record&lt;/code&gt;) &amp;rarr;  if you have  done wrong in the  past, you may  have a
certain traits stronger than other people's, and these traits are more
likely to get you in a situation  that law defines as a crime &amp;larr; a
quick  temper,  a  violent   history,  or  even  single-parent  family
background,   low-education,   drug  taking,   and   so   on  and   so
forth. Actually most people will agree that such statistics do support
these claims.  But if  so, what about  individual!? what  about having
opportunity to correct what was wrong? what about &lt;strong&gt;not discriminating
somebody&lt;/strong&gt; by just putting on a label?  I mean, how do we know we have
stamped a label  too liberally that it has not  becomes a bias against
somebody without a cause or foundation?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But then, without using a label, how do we learn!? The entire so
called science and technology is built upon this method of
abstraction. This is how we can ever simplify the world in a way so
that we can study and comprehend. Otherwise, it will the Go game or
any of the so-called ancient Chinese art form, martial art included,
that we have to count on some odd historical genius to advance it,
because its value lies in its &lt;em&gt;entire format&lt;/em&gt;, so it can not be broken
down, be analytically deciphered, thus hard to teach and to share
knowledge, and impossible to replicate.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I think human is caught in a dilemma. I don't believe there is
solution. Therefore, the struggle between abstracting into a common
theme versus calling to treat individual &lt;em&gt;equally&lt;/em&gt; will continue to
exist without a solution. This then gives a perfect excuse (if they
are actually smart because they consciously manipulated this leverage
to their advantage) or just plainly a side-effect, that discrimination
based on race, gender, education, family tie, whatever (and these are
just labels!), is truly an inherited consequence of the nature of human
recognition. If we think they are evil deeds (which I believe they
are), we have to watch ourselves, and remind ourselves how we have
created them in the first place, like creating a child, you can't just
walk away &amp;rarr; you can be irresponsible by not raising her, but the
biological bond is forever true, and you can't deny it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But when I look at my mosquito bites, I still don't them at all, in a
most general way, with a most general label &amp;rarr; and if I cannot
overcome this, how would I know I won't apply this same flaw on other
things, things that can cause harm to other human, friend or foe!?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As a member of human, I feel powerless.&lt;/p&gt;</content><category term="thoughts"></category><category term="thoughts"></category></entry><entry><title>System capability model</title><link href="https://fengxia41103.github.io/myblog/capability%20model.html" rel="alternate"></link><published>2018-06-12T09:20:00-04:00</published><updated>2018-06-12T09:20:00-04:00</updated><author><name>Feng Xia</name></author><id>tag:fengxia41103.github.io,2018-06-12:/myblog/capability model.html</id><summary type="html">&lt;p&gt;Ah, &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data_center_infrastructure_management"&gt;DCIM&lt;/a&gt;.

eg. interface changes a name, or VLAN gets re-named. Are these
networking management? or asset management?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To give an example: what does it mean when a server is &lt;em&gt;under
management&lt;/em&gt;? First is to inventory (model, serial #,
components...). But this is certainly not sufficient. What's the
&lt;em&gt;state&lt;/em&gt; of it? (firmware version, BIOS settings). Then, reading these
and display them leads to the next step -- can we update them? Now
this is LXCA and its alternatives. But this leads to more, because
server &lt;em&gt;state&lt;/em&gt; is meaningful only to whoever is using it
(workloads).... on top of these, a deployment involving multiple
servers will have a shutdown or bootup sequence which may call for a
specific order because of data dependency &amp;larr; don't shutdown
storage server before all its &lt;em&gt;writers&lt;/em&gt; have been turned off.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Therefore, managing a server will inevitably involve multiple
attributes at the same time, thus it must be a vertical view that cuts
through all the services mentioned above. In other words, previously
we extract a list of attributes from an object and build a system 
based on commonality of their meaning, eg. we put all serial numbers
into a system called "asset management", all fan speed and heat
assumption into a "energy management" system, and so on.
But such approach will always result in overlapping
presentation of the same object in multiple domains, which then
leads to a turf war that each fights over
whose reference is &lt;em&gt;more true than others&lt;/em&gt;. A band-aid concept then is
brought up to build a &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Master_data_management"&gt;MDM&lt;/a&gt;, a place where all different references
are reconcilled so to have a consistency and authority. But then, any
secondary presentation of a data leads to a load of questions such as
data synchronization, data integrity, and whether MDM is a receiver of
first-line system, or the source for them? &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It should not be that way.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;A capability model&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Instead, I am proposing a different approach. Take any attribute you
would like to &lt;em&gt;management&lt;/em&gt;, I would define its management using a
model of &lt;strong&gt;five levels of capabilities&lt;/strong&gt; (see below). The higher the
level of capability we implement, the more control we have over that
attribute, and having control is just another term for management.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;figure class="col s12 center"&gt;
  &lt;img src="images/my%20capability%20model.png"/&gt;
  &lt;figcaption&gt;Five levels of capabilities&lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;level 1: inventory&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is capability of bookkeeping, such as an inventory of hardware as
seen in vanilla netbox. The distinguished character of data is that
they are static &amp;mdash; serial number, UUID, and the like. Some data
are changed over time, such as rack position, but the frequency of its
change justifies it to be fully capable of a manual update.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Acceptable strategy:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;manual, or import&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;auto &amp;larr; discovery &lt;a href="https://github.com/xcat2/confluent/"&gt;confluent&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;level 2: reality, and/or, design&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;These two go hand-in-hand, and I'll explain why so.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Reality is referring to a form of &lt;strong&gt;passive read&lt;/strong&gt; to collect
information &amp;mdash; meta of a system, network traffic, interface name,
power state, host name, MAC address. It provides data to form a view
of &lt;strong&gt;what we actually have&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Remember, in a machine world, if it can read once, it can read
continuously for many many times.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If one can describe a reality, the same syntax shall be able to
describe also a &lt;strong&gt;design&lt;/strong&gt; &amp;mdash; an expectation of what we want to
have.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In any software-defined scheme, we can easily relate to a set of
&lt;em&gt;configuration values&lt;/em&gt; as the design, while their effects represent
the reality &amp;mdash; I want to set host name to be "xyz", well, so what
is its name as of this moment? or in a programming language context,
reality is the &lt;code&gt;get&lt;/code&gt; while design is the &lt;code&gt;set&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But one curious thing of this level is that these two capabilities are
not both required! You can have a way to read reality, but may have no
way to match it to a design. For example, &lt;a href="https://www.elastic.co/products/logstash"&gt;&lt;code&gt;logdash&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, is a reality
tool, not a design tool. Then there is Visio, PPT, Word, that you can
write all about your design, and they will not do anything to convert
your text to a line of code or a configured system.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Acceptable strategy:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;For monitoring, auto ONLY (manual is meaningless).&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;level 3: diff&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Diff = reality - design&lt;/strong&gt;.  If you have ever been in a brainstorm
session of new idea, this is what got most people execited about,
because it quickly leads to: customer configurable threshold, and
&lt;strong&gt;alerts&lt;/strong&gt;. Now everybody is picturing a buzzing text message, or at
least an email, to alert an admin in the middle of a night when &lt;strong&gt;a
diff exceeds a threshold&lt;/strong&gt; &amp;larr; it feels empowering, intelligent,
and machine like.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But this is a lot harder than many would like to believe. The
challenge lies in the detail of the &lt;strong&gt;design&lt;/strong&gt; &amp;larr; what consists of
your design? what are the indexes? values? definition of done? Few
people are good at describing what they want in an upfront
fashion. Often enough it becomes a guess game, while either both
parties enjoy, or one gets completly annoyed and frustrated.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You: I want to buy a ticket.
Agent: where are you going?
You: Raleigh, NC.
Agent: here it is.
You: But it's no good.
Agent: What do you mean?
You: It's not a United Airline flight.
Agent: Oh, np. Here is a UA ticket.
You: No good.
Agent: Why?
You: It's a morning flight!
Agent: What would you prefer?
.....&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Challenge is in the hand of designer &amp;mdash; how well can s/he list
out a list of preferences, and how important they are... if you have
written software requirements, you know most, if not all projects, die
right here.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Acceptable strategy:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;auto (manual is meaningless).&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;level 4: design &amp;rarr; reality&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As soon as one can monitor and validate (level 3 capabilities), the
next logical step is to &lt;strong&gt;make design into reality&lt;/strong&gt;. This at least
takes care of Day 0 deployment. It requires:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;a syntax to describe design, &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;a tool to convert it into executable instructions, &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;a monitoring service/agent to read where we are&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;a validation/diff to know how far are we from destination&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To user, this is what they will call a &lt;code&gt;state&lt;/code&gt; &amp;mdash; they give you a
wish list, and you are the genie in a bottle.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Acceptable strategy:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;paper instruction&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;some level of automation&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;many orchestration tools all claim to achieve this with zero pains.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;level 5: diff &amp;rarr; design&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If level 4 gets your design to a reality on day 1, then system will
inevitably drift and diff from design over time. Alert is nice, but
self-correction is better.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Different from design &amp;rarr; reality, diff is essentially a moving
target. Unlike design which is a static set of expectations, diff can
expose a value on one has thought about. Thus a capability to bring
diff back into designed state is a challenge.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Acceptable strategy:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Full re-build: wipe it clean and re-build as if new.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Incremental correction.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Hybrid: this is the hardest one, also the most likely approach,
   because it involves a decision of when we should just wipe it clean
   and rebuild, and when a correction is preferred.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;An exercise&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Let's try it with managing a server. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;figure class="col s12 center"&gt;
  &lt;img src="images/netbox%20device.png"/&gt;
  &lt;figcaption&gt;Example: netbox device model&lt;/figcaption&gt;  
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Filling a value to each and every attribute field does not make the
server managed&lt;/strong&gt;. Instead, we should examine one attribute at a time. Take
&lt;code&gt;primary_ip4&lt;/code&gt; attribute for example:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;level 1: can we document/inventory its value?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;level 2: &lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;reality: can we discover IP and match it with a server?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;design: can we define an IP for a server before this IP actually
  exists?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;level 3: can we audit and sound an alarm if there is a diff?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;level 4: can we command this server to obtain a pre-defined IP?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;level 5: if diff is detected, can we do sonmething to re-obtain the original IP
   besides sounding an alarm?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In Netbox, this capability stops at level 1. It can inventory, but has
no discovery capability, no design capability, thus having no level
3-5 capabilities either. Therefore, the IP attribute of a
server in Netbox is managed at Level 1, if that satisfies your requirement.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;Conclusion&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There is no silver bullet. View, framework, paradigm, these are just
convenient words, labels, jargons, or BS-es. Attribute is often real
and concrete &amp;mdash; a rack position, a serial number;
but its management is ambiguous. However, following a vertical view
in term of these capabilities, we can at least create five

&lt;p&gt;Sitting in Lucky Tree with Noah yesterday evening was a wonderful
time. Sunset, the lights came through the corridor like a special
lighting effect. Noah was absorbed in his silly word game and his back
was facing the door, so he couldn't see the lights, but it was there,
for me, to experience this moment of quietness, family-ness, just he
and I, and he was in a good mood, laughing at my silly jokes as if I
were the best comedian, and he picked it up with his own silly twist,
and went on to invent a whole series of words that were completely
new, completely silly, but he enjoyed them very much. And I so wished
you were there, if the three of us, to be there, just like the last
morning we went for breakfast, and you and Noah went off to get him a
cake, when you walked to me, leading Noah's hand, I could only wish
the time to stop, stop, stop. There were nothing more I could want,
nothing more I would wish, nothing more.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Don't know where you are now. Walking in this world becomes
dull. Lights shined on me, made me to close eyes for a while. Like
waking up from a dream, suddenly, wake up, look around, you have gone,
nowhere to be found.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Only lights, evening sunset, through the front door, filled room with
a lullaby, 我最亲爱的人, 你在哪儿?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It's quiet here. Office is deserted due to the upcoming long
weekend. It feels rather strange. Listening to the &lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MZqdlZ3juJI"&gt;song&lt;/a&gt; makes me to
think of you, and the days agains. Mr.Makato is still here. He is
always here early in the morning, and leave late at night. Is he is
alone? Doesn't he ever go home? Does he have a home?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I want to see you. This moment of quietness. A scene came to my mind,
that years later when I was still thinking of you, and my kids look at
me and you, and could not figure out what is soo good about you, like
when we look at others' love, you wonder what's so special of that
person to make him/her so hooked to it. For outsiders, it always looks
&lt;em&gt;unlikely&lt;/em&gt;, but for people who are the subjective, s/he can't help it.
So that's how I am feeling. I can't help it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Was ready to go home, to pick up Noah early so we can spend some time
together. I can already see his smile if I tell him we can play
computer game together. What a wonderful age! He is so easily
entertained, satisfied, and find so many things, happy, genuinely
happy. When did I lose these on the way to now? I may still have some,
but not a lot left, and is becoming less and less. How sad.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I always think there is a song for any couple, either as boyfriend
girlfriend, or just a one-night-stand. Whatever, there is a song, that
describes the mood, the scene, the feel, the touch, the emotion when
two eyes first met, when two hands first touch, when two bodies first
unite, for the two hearts first soften and melt. Love is wonderful. I
can't think of anything else in life so far that gives you more of a
sensation than when you are in love. I think women are indeed wiser
than men &amp;larr; women recognize this long ago before a man grows to
his maturity and start to realize how wonderful a relationship he
has/had.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Sometimes I try to picture that song. There is one you sent me. I like
it. I thought it is the one. But sometimes I felt otherwise. This, the
one I'm listening, feels more like how I feel. Then there are other
songs, that bring back other memories, feelings, people in the past,
or life in the past, pain or happiness &amp;larr; you know, regardless
what they are, they are always part of you, just like any food you
eat, will eventually become part of you, and any book you read, shapes
your mind, even just a tiny bit, will now inseparable. 蒋方舟 said
"dating with someone is like a ghost story, because you see the
reflections of all his/her previous relationships". How true. So
sometimes I feel I shouldn't have let you go, because the process is
what matters; but still, everytime I start to miss you, I remind
myself how I could have faced otherwise when I'm getting too old for
you, and you have such a full life ahead! No I can't, I can't do this
to you. You are free, and should be free. Live a life as it will give
you, I don't know how good or bad it can be. Forever I wanted to be
next to you so to make sure you are protected, cherished. I will do
that, as a shadow perhaps, so when you fall, ever, that's when you
will feel me again, down below, to catch you.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Bless.

&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I just had a thought &amp;mdash; many mid-age women claim that they feel
the best of themselves in this age band because they are independent,
self-sufficient, less anxious, not that they have fewer troubles in
life, but they view them as a matter-of-fact, just deal with it when
it comes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On one hand, the cliche is always that mid-age is a tough time because
we have fewer choices now than when we were young, but much more
obligation/responsibilities to fulfill, family, kids, parents, and so
on. Therefore there are many of the "I have to" scenarios, part of it
that it becomes a convenient execuse to do the things you want and to
dodge the things you don't like; on the other hand they do feel that
you have to do them because you are aware that alternatives (not
like before that you simply don't know what the alternative path can
lead to, thus were feeling hopeful because you didn't know better), if
any, is not that pretty and easy either. So might as well …&lt;/p&gt;</summary><content type="html">&lt;figure class="col l6 m6 s12"&gt;

like before that you simply don't know what the alternative path can
lead to, thus were feeling hopeful because you didn't know better), if
any, is not that pretty and easy either. So might as well &lt;em&gt;force
through&lt;/em&gt; on this same path, of which at least you know some about. So
there is marriage that people hold on to, not that they like it, but
they feel they have to (until another &lt;strong&gt;perfect candidate&lt;/strong&gt; shows up
in hour life), the job you have to go to everyday (and all jobs are
not fun and easy, and mingle with a new team, new environment,
essentially a new social group, is not only very tiring, but quite
scary.).....&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So literature, talks, movies, TVs, all depict a mid-life crisis when
these inevitable tasks crash on you, probably in a blow-up fashion
(when all the misfortunes happen at once), and honestly, the blow-up
fashion is the probably the only possible fashion this will play out,
because the original so called "balance" is so fragile that any
deviation will cause it to &amp;rarr; CRASH! So we keep tittering by the
edge of a cliff, trying not to look down, not to fall, to fool the
mind that the cliff does not exist, to look for even a grass to grab,
thinking that at least it will create some resistance when gravity
kicks in &amp;larr; maybe it will slow down the fall? maybe it is just
strong enough to hold me?.... in sum, we want a sense of security, but
it feels like an impossible goal.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But then, why women in their 40s feel so good about themselves? and
even for myself, I feel so much, more sure about myself than ever, not
because of the skills I have or the job or the status. I mean, if
measured by any of these dimensions I'm an absolute loser in any
common sense and categories. No. I started to feel "sure" about myself
because now I'm angrier these day, which then translate to that I
constantly feel that I don't care much about the surroundings, other
people's views or opinions, anymore. Noah, like me, is keenly
sensitive of people around, and gets influenced easily. Siqi, probably
the same, when she said she is a like a mirror merely reflecting the
people around her. I wonder this is an attribute of smartness &amp;larr;
because you are smart, your mind is that much perceptive to things and
people, so you, if viewed as a machine, acquires a much greater amount
of information that it feeds your powerful brain to process to keep it
busy, then in return you feel more, know more, think more, thun wiser
and smarter, than those who don't &amp;mdash; a perfect, positive,
feedback loop!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So when I don't pay attention to others anymore, does it then make me
dumb, in the end, because I cut off the feedback loop now? Actually I
would say no. Sometimes I feel I'm simply turning inward more, so I
still sense these things, think/process, but it becomes an
entertainment for myself, a show without an audience, versus when I
was younger the best time is when there is an audience who
applauds. No, audience is not needed anymore. I think that makes a
difference. This leads to that since I don't seek for approval by
others, things you do, or not do, becomes solely your own decision
&amp;mdash; you do it because you enjoy some part of it, no one forces you
to. Alternatives are many. The reason you didn't take them is not that
you have to do this one, but you have made a choice for yourself. And
even for alternatives, I sometimes think I know too many alternatives,
which makes choice difficult (aren't we all fear the cost of
opportunity?). If only God has laid one path in front of you, and you
have no choice but this one! &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For young folks, alternatives were few, due mostly to their limited
life experience (at one point I firmly believed that going to college,
getting married, having a kid, is THE ONLY GOOD PATH I should
take). As many of them look quite promising, because, they seem to
solve the current problem. Well, they might do solve your problem, but
they also come with theirs, just different ones, and devils are in the
details, they only look easier than what you have because, you haven't
been there yet. Once you take a few steps on that alternative path,
boy, isn't this one hard!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So this is what life has taught me &amp;mdash; there is no silver
bullet. Everything comes with a set of good things and bad
things. Making decision or choosing alternative is simply swapping one
set of these goods and bads with another. No difference (well, there
is I have to say, because Siqi is such a wonderful, beautiful, person,
of mind &amp;amp; soul.) Therefore, I feel relieved at this age, that there
isn't anything I &lt;strong&gt;have to&lt;/strong&gt;. No. There are many I can choose from,
because it's all about whether I'm willing to take that path or not.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I think this explains why these 40ish women feel relieved, and I think
it's the right feeling to have. We in our 40s have less possibilities,
but abundant alternatives. What's lacking is will, but that's not an
age thing. It's more of a personal attribute, some have it, some
don't. It can be labled as risk taking, or being conservative, or
being a responsible, or just being satisfied with what you have
(what-is-happiness kind of talk).... whatever it is called, I want to
make it clear, that &lt;strong&gt;it's a decision you are making, there is no
"I have to", there is only "I do"&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;</content><category term="thoughts"></category><category term="thoughts"></category></entry><entry><title>How many can one love</title><link href="https://fengxia41103.github.io/myblog/how%20many%20can%20one%20love.html" rel="alternate"></link><published>2018-05-14T11:30:00-04:00</published><updated>2018-05-14T11:30:00-04:00</updated><author><name>Feng Xia</name></author><id>tag:fengxia41103.github.io,2018-05-14:/myblog/how many can one love.html</id><summary type="html">&lt;figure class="col l6 m6 s12"&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Train is an interesting, amazing thing. Never thought I will be
sitting on a train (CalTrain) which brought me a feeling of riding
train in China.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I haven't expected to see your messages, because I think it is the
right thing to do that I should disappear from your life
entirely. Watching a movie the other night, a line struck me &amp;mdash; a
woman said she hates a man, that she is now 39, and have not
married. I don't want you to be like that. I want you to move on your
life, because you have so much ahead of you. Don't waste time with
me. Don't. Everyone has a life to live, live yours, experience
yours. I feel like a parent who is watching over his child, knowing
all too well what is ahead of him, yet have to refrain from directing
his life &amp;mdash; if it were a fall, I could only be there when he
falls, and pull him out if I am able to. So that's how I feel,

watching the Californian sun zooming by my window. Out there, it is a
crowded town with homes, cars, trees, grasses, mountain at remote
background. But they are just passing by; you, stayed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Walking on the street the other night, I was thinking to myself, just
how many women I have fallen in love with in my life? Surprisingly,
there have been quite a few. So what does it mean? Does it mean that
human, or male, is capable of (or rather, instintly will) loving
&lt;em&gt;quite a few? Each episode was real. I tried to think which one is the
one I _love the most&lt;/em&gt;, the one who left a dent on my soul, whereas
others who have been loved, but moved on? Sometime I picture lying in
death bed, which one of them I would want to see the most, the one
whom I want to know she is doing well, will be ok, and regretfully I
now have to leave first?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Each breakup was a tough one. They all felt the end of the world. I
know some have now faded in memory whose name and smile hardly pass
through my mind anymore. Then there are one and two, whose voice and
figure linger on, peeked from deep inside as often as they have always
been, fresh, close, vivid, real.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So, how many can one love in a life? many, perhaps. Then there is one,
whose shadow takes over all of them. Is she the true love? or just a
wound never closed? or, perhaps, as perfect as a love, can be?&lt;/p&gt;</content><category term="thoughts"></category><category term="love"></category></entry><entry><title>Technology and society</title><link href="https://fengxia41103.github.io/myblog/technology%20and%20society.html" rel="alternate"></link><published>2018-05-02T16:02:00-04:00</published><updated>2018-05-02T16:02:00-04:00</updated><author><name>Feng Xia</name></author><id>tag:fengxia41103.github.io,2018-05-02:/myblog/technology and society.html</id><summary type="html">&lt;figure class="col s12"&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I have been thinking quite a bit about technology, and its
relationship to society. I used to be a firm believer, and a
practitioner, of technology. After all, it is what I do, and I
actually enjoying writing code and drawing diagrams to analyze a
problem at hand and to illustrate my thinkings.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;government knows more than we have imagined&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;However, while reading the book &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/Short-History-Chinese-Communism-Franklin/dp/0138094187/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&amp;amp;qid=1525356168&amp;amp;sr=8-1&amp;amp;keywords=short+history+of+the+chinese+communism"&gt;"Short history the Chinese

written in 1970s, has a quite good understanding of CCP's historical
events, its path till the writing, its organization, its agenda, and
its main players and who they are and what they do and have done. What
makes it even more impressive is that data are collected from official

&lt;strong&gt;biased&lt;/strong&gt; opinion, is so crooked and abused that nothing is worth
noticing, let alone quoting. But author has made a clear case out of
these, and have illustrated cleared and nicely how the party has
formulated its strategies to get where it is. It certainly had a
critical tone on many of the policies, especially it had zero illusion
of its propaganda and the political objective these tools were used to
achieve. Towards the mid reading, I could almost picture myself being
a party chief or a country lead who thinks not of picture of
individual's life, but an impact on a mass scale that effects will be
counted in generations, and trial-and-error in lights of its being
beneficial or necessary for many while some, well there will always be
some edges cases don't you think?, who will lose and suffer &amp;mdash; so
it's life, so it's always the case, so if the number is small enough
and I could sleep well without losing conscience, this will the price
to pay. Too bad.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This feeling scares me! I start to understand how these people sitting
on the top of a country/county/province will reason on a
policy/decision. The impact is too remote, and their life are
&lt;strong&gt;isolated&lt;/strong&gt; from it so they are essentially operating a joy stick of
a war game killing and all without feeling a pinch. Therefore, it is
not that they are dark minded, well some of them are, but the system
has &lt;strong&gt;prevented them from relating to&lt;/strong&gt; the consequence of their
decision. As if a feedback loop is cut, there is not enough
information for them to think otherwise larr; I'm not giving them
execues. But I do want to gain a better understanding of them instead
of just despising them blankly.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So now back on this book. If it is available, someone in the
government would read it &amp;rarr; that means government's knowledge pool
(in a general sense) has these bits &amp;rarr; US has a really good
understanding of CCP, and vice versa &amp;rarr; a looked confusing
decision made by either government is likely based on such knowledge
pool while the mass (myself as one, so are all the Beijing taxi
drivers) will only be baffled because we do not have access to that
knowledge pool &amp;rarr; since gov has an army of smart people (analysts
and so on) to collect, to study these books and information, its
knowledge pool is logically more comprehensive and richer than any
individual's &amp;rarr; its decision can not be dismissed
lightly. Instead, these decisions are logical, strong, and careful,
but the flaw lies in that decision makers are systematically shielded
from negative impact of their own behaviors, thus making them fly
blindly &amp;rarr; decision will be irrational, random, harmful, arrogant,
even ridiculous.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Therefore, the question is, how to give them a feedback loop?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;on technology&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I have been thinking over a lot about the line Siqi said that she is
like mirror, merely reflecting the people around her. I actually
wonder whether this is true to anybody &amp;larr; don't we all be
influenced (tinted or distilled) by our social environment?  don't we
all will adopt the behaviorial pattern, some necessary for a
day-to-day survival, some just convenient (in this social
circumstance)? don't we all learn from peer and others around us whose
acts will inevitably impact our life (work &amp;amp; leisure) so we would have
to &lt;strong&gt;react&lt;/strong&gt; to them, thus involuntarily fall into the logical path
that their behaviors have initiated?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This makes me feel that human, as individual or as a mass, is
fatefully trapped in an ebb of force-and-counter-force, which is
exactly why we constantly feel 人在江湖身不由己. Then, what about
freedom of the mind? control of your own life/destiny? be what you
want to be?... are these just illusions one gives to oneself? or the
society/media/government/education has etched into your mind, just
like these communist methods to preach their ideology to the young so
to shape their belief? &amp;rarr; this is a bleak picture, I think.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So, what's the role technology is playing? I mean, is it elevating us
out of this trap, or is it deepening the trap, or just numbing us in a
new way, like a new medicine that promises wonder, but ages later the
generation will be laughing at it because it is made of nothing but
harmless and useless dirt? One way or the other, what is the proof?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;Proof that it is helping&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There are plenty. Living standard is definitely much much higher than
before, which was made only possible because of the development of
technology &amp;mdash; count any appliances you can't live without, iphone
included. Well, one can also argue that the standard is measured by
modern men, therefore looking from an ancient prospective, it is worse
than then, not better &amp;larr; well, it is a fair statement. After all,
and adjective is up for debate (see &lt;a href="https://fengxia41103.github.io/myblog/mid night.html"&gt;mid night&lt;/a&gt; and
&lt;a href="https://fengxia41103.github.io/myblog/euphemism.html"&gt;euphemism&lt;/a&gt;). But even for those &lt;strong&gt;organic fever&lt;/strong&gt; person,
natural's benefit is only enjoyable if nature's disease doesn't kill
you like they used to, for which we owe to advancement of medical
knowledge, to biology, to methods/workflows/statistics/... that made
these advancements happen. So for that, as long as you are actually
reading this article, you are already an beneficiary of technology,
and your living standard is a fruit of technology.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;Proof that it is not working&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Technology is speeding up information flow, information storage, and
information creation. My perception is that a vast amount of &lt;strong&gt;one-time
data&lt;/strong&gt; are being created due to convenience of technology. They do
contain information; but that information will be permanently locked
in itself that they will never be used &amp;rarr; in other words, if we
measure a life span of information from its creation to its demise, I
would dare to guess that 99.99999% of all data that are being created
today will be less than a day, an hour, an instant (can I find a study on
this topic!?). When was a last time you flip through that selfie from
yesterday, or last year's birthday party, or of your ex-? It was
generated, stored (probably multiple copies on the Internet), and
forgotten. Period. This feels like those sad stuff animals. But the
rate of these information, especially the ones in digital form, is
unprecedently higher than anything human has experienced up to the
last 15 years!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So, do we really know what we are doing?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;acceleration of generation crowding-out&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One thing I have been witnessing is that an acceleration of younger
generation &lt;em&gt;pushing out&lt;/em&gt; those who are less than even 10 years senior
to them &amp;larr; what I called "China's youth culture".  In other words,
the life span of a person's social contribution is under a mounting
pressure &amp;mdash; it's manifest in China that 00s is pushing out 90s,
and 90s was obsoleting 80s, and so forth. Each generation feels a
shortening window for them to be a contributor as worker bees, which
in its reality sense means &lt;strong&gt;you will be viewed as too old to find a
job&lt;/strong&gt;. A common reasoning is that wealth has been rising, thus making
leisure a more acceptable life style than a working bee &amp;larr; after
all, who wants to work if one can get a comfortable life without it!?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="center" style="max-width:854px"&gt;

    &lt;/iframe&gt;
  &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But the &lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yPGwA7t6bpI"&gt;"Grow old better"&lt;/a&gt; by Jared Diamond has another point
&amp;mdash; the Internet is now a repository of human knowledge. It
enables the young with access to information that were previously
unattainable unless you were privileged (priest) and old enough
(elders in a tribe).  Btw, they also operate those devices much better
than older generations. Therefore, they should legitimately feel
&lt;strong&gt;empowered&lt;/strong&gt; and on par with senior peers. The competitive advantage
of an older generation lies in their &lt;strong&gt;experience&lt;/strong&gt; &amp;larr; gained by
internalizing these information and by practicing them (and failed
more times over time). But then, how many in that generation holds up
to that!? Few. Most people are not only lazy thinker, but lazy
practitioner &amp;rarr; they hear, but hearing is not
listening. Therefore, new crops in their 20s are not only equipped
with the same information, but are hungrier (socially), cheaper
(financially), healthier, and can be over-worked without breaking down
or revolution. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As a captalist, whom would you pick?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;can information lead to democracy?&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Another hope of technology is that information transparency brings
accountability, thus leaning towards democracy. It can be said that
Arab Spring and many others were exactly that. But then, there is the
GFW which we can conveniently blame for its backwardness.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But how about many poor/developing countries/continent whose
population has access to Youtube, but remained to be war plagued,
struggling with basic human needs!? Cambodia doesn't ban Youtube.  But
even those who own a phone are busy making ends meet, and thoughts of
self-education via these only resources have to be secondary at
best. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And among rich countries, information is not too little, but too much.
Many of them are manufactured, manipulated, false, are skewing mass
opinion under the cover of data analysis, AI, or simply,
technology. If wealth of information is causal to a &lt;em&gt;good&lt;/em&gt; society,
then it is not showing its effect. Facebook falls into a fiasco of
Cambridge Analytics. Is it really wrong to piece together a &lt;em&gt;social
profile&lt;/em&gt; of a voter in technology so to influence his/her vote? After
all, didn't users give Facebook those data at the first place? and to
ask them draw a line within which their data CAN be used, are they
capable to describe, explain, let alone enforce!?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I used to think there is an arm race between computer technology
(cloud computing comes to mind) and evils like the GFW. I know for
sure technology side will win. But I was also thinking a free
information flow is good for everybody, and will bring enlightenment,
reasoning, you know, all the good stuff. But I am becoming more and
more pessimistic about this view now. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The goal can be achieved:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Access to information.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Information is factual.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Reader will read this information.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;S/he will internalize it (understands its meaning/intention).&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;S/he can learn from it.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;... the more I'm writing down this list, the more I feel there is no
hope. The condition chain will break down as early as #2!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I don't know. Technology is the best thing we know so far. It's not a
wonder pill, not even a happy pill. It's a method better than
none. Maybe just focus on getting #1 done, and let human carry his own
fate from that point on.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;God bless us all.&lt;/p&gt;</content><category term="thoughts"></category><category term="thoughts"></category></entry><entry><title>Sadness</title><link href="https://fengxia41103.github.io/myblog/sadness.html" rel="alternate"></link><published>2018-04-27T13:00:00-04:00</published><updated>2018-04-27T13:00:00-04:00</updated><author><name>Feng Xia</name></author><id>tag:fengxia41103.github.io,2018-04-27:/myblog/sadness.html</id><summary type="html">&lt;figure class="col s12"&gt;

met and were in love. I was 27, she was 19. I don't know how many
times I have watched, listened to, and dreamed of, this movie. Each
time it touches me deeper and deeper, makes me wonder why two people
would love then go apart, marry yet think back, miss the other person

&lt;p&gt;It's a wonderful movie, a wonderful story. The guitar at Chen Li's

it is a memory one can only dare to look at when the memory is about
to disappear forever, still pains, still hurts, still live, still
real.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I don't know. Sadness, a boundless ocean of sadness, surrounds me
when the music plays. I was talking to Noah's mom last night that I

&lt;p&gt;I was thinking. People get anxious on topic like bitcoin, why? Some
talk says because the feeling of "loss" is greater than the feeling of
"gain" even though the amount is the same. This has been proven in
stock books. But then, things like bitcoin, or success, is &lt;strong&gt;NOT&lt;/strong&gt; a
loss &amp;larr; you can only lose something if you had it already. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As you can see, many many many times, marketing or hooligans will
present this thing in a light of "them being finite" &amp;mdash; there are
only these many ocean view spots you can ever build a house for; there
is only these many bitcoins determined by its algorithm (and do we
have a math book on this algorithm!? and how much have we proven, on
paper, that its set is finite!? I mean, how do I know this statement
is true!?), and even life itself &amp;mdash; you can live once, so
maximize it (by doing ______ ). How familiar! but also how strange!
Why is this effective!? Why do you get anxious when the resource is
presented …&lt;/p&gt;</summary><content type="html">&lt;figure class="col l6 m6 s12"&gt;

maximize it (by doing ______ ). How familiar! but also how strange!
Why is this effective!? Why do you get anxious when the resource is
presented as being &lt;strong&gt;finite&lt;/strong&gt;? and if you take a step back, tell me
one thing that is not finite!? Few, if not none! Then why bother!?
Everything is finite, so why is this one any different? But reality
is, that we get anxious by it &amp;mdash; missing a love, missing a good
job, missing a friend gathering, missing a lottery ticket, or simply,
scared of getting old (life is a process of counting down,
continuously, stubbornly, irreversibly, and sadly &amp;larr; sad because
I'm anxious!)... so why!?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A missing opportunity?  This feels like peer pressure. Everyone is
getting on this wagon, I can't be left behind. Last time when I was at
Reader's Corner, two old guys were chatting with clerk about
aging. One guy said, "you know you are getting old when your doctors
are becoming younger than you". Clerk said, "I knew a woman who lived
into her 100s. You know what is good about being that old?... she
said, no peer pressure".. hahaha. So true. So come back to the
topic. The missing opportunity only comes into play if you consider
that you can, or stand a chance, of benefiting from that opportunity;
otherwise, I don't think it matters.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But why do you think you stand a chance? One an age old confession is
that human are &lt;strong&gt;over&lt;/strong&gt;-optimistic when evaluating risks. There are
many rational, for example, that's how human race has survived in the
wild, so it's part of our built-ins. But this doesn't explain it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Then, alternatively, there is opportunistic, which is just "exploiting
chances offered by immediate circumstances without reference to a
general plan or moral principle." But what's wrong of being
opportunist? I don't know the difference. Isn't opportunity a good
word? When so called an opportunity presents itself in front of you,
how do you determine whether this is an opportunity? and how would you
know whether taking it will jeopardize your integrity? If turn out
your integrity or moral was comprised, well, you were an opportunist;
if not, were you then an entrepreneur?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But don't these also lead the same thing I have discussed over and
over, that these are just words, invented by someone or some
culture/country to describe a thing/feeling. Now writing this I feel
the word should only be frozen in that moment when it was first
appearing, because then we have no way to reconstruct the context in
which it was invented, therefore any subsequent use of it is literally
a risk of tagging something that is similar (maybe), but can also be
the negation (also valid) &amp;larr; how do you know!? &amp;rarr; this becomes
a chicken-egg race, &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;you can't determine whether this is thesame-as/similar-to the
   original circumstance when this word was valid/invented because you
   don't understand the current situation yet;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;but in order to understand current, you have to use these words to
   &lt;strong&gt;describe&lt;/strong&gt; (to your brain, really);&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;but by using these words to describe, you have already committed
   their meaning/implication, and will be limited by their
   limitation. Therefore, you will not be able to jail-break so to
   understand the current situation as they are &amp;larr; it's like
   looking through a tinted glass &amp;rarr; everything will be blue-ish,
   if your glass is blue.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Very strange a world we are living in, indeed! Human invented language
in order to communicate ideas. But then ideas are expressed by
language which themselves &lt;strong&gt;tinted&lt;/strong&gt; the ideas so ideas are now
becoming ambiguous, subject to interpretatoin, and abusive even.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But cutting off all language, thus communication, will result in what?
silence of the world? or death of the human race? or a idea-less
crowd!? None sounds appealing. In this sense, English, being adopted
by 70% of the world population (especially by the billion Chinese), is
totally doing human a favor &amp;mdash; then, everyone is also confined by
English way of thinking, judgement, rational, and this mental
dominance. I think this must be the theoretical foundation behind
propaganda, that enforcing ppl to use &lt;strong&gt;your language&lt;/strong&gt; is &lt;strong&gt;THE way to
shape their logic, and to shape their mind&lt;/strong&gt; &amp;rarr; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"Now take this blue
glass and put it on. Didn't I tell you that this world is actually
blue!?" "OMG! You are sooooo right!"
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Magic. Isn't it!?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So when you get anxious over something next time, look for a
different language to use, and I can guarantee this anxiety will go
away. Reality didn't change; resource is still finite (as always, and
will always be); anxiety, is just an English word trying to describe
your feeling; and your feeling, can be called "happiness" in Mars's
term, and they have a lot of books in Mars to teach you that,
"Happiness, is all you should care."&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ha, ha, ha.&lt;/p&gt;</content><category term="thoughts"></category><category term="thoughts"></category></entry><entry><title>Mid night</title><link href="https://fengxia41103.github.io/myblog/mid%20night.html" rel="alternate"></link><published>2018-04-24T00:00:00-04:00</published><updated>2018-04-24T00:00:00-04:00</updated><author><name>Feng Xia</name></author><id>tag:fengxia41103.github.io,2018-04-24:/myblog/mid night.html</id><summary type="html">&lt;figure class="col l6 m12 s12"&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Since coming back from Spring Break trip, my body and mind have been
really tired. Work is progressing fine. A lot of new things to learn,
but overall are quite manageable. But work is just, work. I was
sitting in this good looking, big kitchen 2 o'clock in the morning
after fixing a few things, but I really missed you.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Writing to you have become a habit, if not the only person I feel an
urge to talk to, to share what comes to my mind, if not what sits on
my soul. But I felt so lonely sometimes, since I don't know where you
are about, and where you will ever be anymore. I asked myself a lot
about whether there will be another time that our path will cross. But
I can't feel it anymore. It feels as strange as if we had never met. I
think it's better that way, I mean, to be able continue the path you
were on, and take me as an episode of fun that enriches your …&lt;/p&gt;</summary><content type="html">&lt;figure class="col l6 m12 s12"&gt;

hold on to a course to what you feel so, and don't be distracted by me
&amp;mdash; I think this will be better, because I never left, and you
will have me there when you need.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I don't know. Life is not hard, it's just sad. It's a bit of sugar in
a lot of sand. It grinds, and grinds, and grinds, till one becomes
mediocre, plain, and somewhat heart-broken.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;America, is actually not a foe&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It looks just strange to me that these articles always have an implied
assumption that since America is dominating the world but is not
&lt;em&gt;doing well&lt;/em&gt;, and China is catching up, if not surpassing, fast, that
the two are looking at a battle/war that only one will come out
live. How ridiculous a view this is!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Through WWI and WWII, honestly, America doesn't owe China. On the
contrary we should be grateful for their supplies to keep the country
afloat. And even as for the world in general, America held up the Ally
camp with its deep pocket and truly had a heart of a gentleman by not
asking for colonies and territories even though at that moment there
was not the slightest doubt that if he wanted, he would have had it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Besides, the whole talk about ZTE thus the national
risk of not having our own CPU or so is just strange. After all, one
country just can not have everything that he ever needs, period. So
let's say we have come up a CPU capability, then what? Do we need to
implement and manufacture everything in order to feel secure? This is
just not realistic, nor practical. So there will be things that are
ever important to so called national security, yet it is not
controlled and owned by China, and you just have to live with this
reality. If taking the example of an individual person, the practical
approach is simply to be kind to your vendor (for things you don't
have), and probably need to be kind to your customer, too, for things
you have and want to sell.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So the statement or the feeling of anxiety under the name of national
security or national pride, is just bogus. This probably ties to what
I have described as &lt;a href="https://fengxia41103.github.io/myblog/hurt feelings.html"&gt;hurt feelings&lt;/a&gt;, that you can not control
others' perception, thus China will continue to feel crisis regardless
how powerful it has become, and this feeling of pride or shame
(however you want to interpret it) will not go away, because they have
chosen to feel that way, and there is nothing you can do
about. Therefore, America is definitely a foe in that psychological
sense. Once China has surpassed America, the world No.1 will not
bring them a sense of satisfaction, it will only reveal how
meaningless, or even burdensome, to be called No.1, and how the life
of No.1 is so different from what it is looked like from a lower
position &amp;larr; after all, the grass is always greener on the other
side.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;Facebook&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I feel like a prophet these days. Really. If you ever read my article
on &lt;a href="https://fengxia41103.github.io/myblog/science.html"&gt;science&lt;/a&gt;, you would have known my position &amp;mdash; data is
neither truth nor fact. It contains information, but no theory has
said that this information is good or bad, right or wrong, useful or
useless, will do good or will do bad. Data is actually quite a
dangerous thing, because the burden of information has been of
collecting them and of storing them, in the past. But with the Internet
we have not only made great progress on them, but have gone too far! I
think &lt;strong&gt;we have created too much information&lt;/strong&gt; &amp;mdash; not in the
sense of variety and taking much longer to read through, if even
possible to &lt;em&gt;learn&lt;/em&gt; and internalize. I think we have &lt;strong&gt;manufactured&lt;/strong&gt;
data that are simply misleading, bogus, meaningless, and outright garbage.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The talk about Facebook becomes a laughing stock in China &amp;mdash; a
spectacular show of a hero fall from its shrine. But I think this is
exactly why US will continue to lead technology, because audited by
congress is just not fun, and you'd better get your notes lined up. I
challenge any of the BAT to sit in front a committee like that and
live through such scrutiny. This is like what ppl say about medical
progress, that people nowadays have a lot more problems than before,
but it's because we now have a name for it (before Dad, I challenge
anyone in China has regarded his situation in any medical sense
&amp;mdash; dementia, Alzheimer). So let them laugh, &lt;strong&gt;ignorance is the
recipe for happiness, indeed&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Data collection and so called profiling of a customer or a citizen (as
what China takes big data and AI for), is quite a topic worth
debating. Let's say you get this capability. Then what!? How do you
guard it from doing evil? But this leads to ancient topic that any
power, super power in particular, always poses this same question. If
you look &lt;a href="https://fengxia41103.github.io/myblog/data and credit score.html"&gt;data integrity&lt;/a&gt;, you will see that trusting these firms
to be a Saint, or trusting government to be on its good behavior when
they possess such power, is just plainly suicidal.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;Human lives in a virtual world&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Regardless what thoughts I want to express, or to discuss, inevitably
I have to assign them a name, a tag really, because our own name is
really
nothing but a tag (but any new parent takes this tag ever so seriously
as if it had magic power to determine future!) But it just feels so
wrong, while so necessary.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To me, human language (what do you mean by &lt;code&gt;evil&lt;/code&gt;?) is the &lt;strong&gt;HARD&lt;/strong&gt;
limit for human progress. I don't know how philosopher deals with
this.  They must feel more keen of this than I do. When I feel caught
in these &lt;strong&gt;language loop&lt;/strong&gt;, this whole world feels like a giant
computer game, that we have invented all the names for things,
invented a word to describe feeling, thought, so on and on, but in the
end, &lt;strong&gt;the least clarity lies in those names, words&lt;/strong&gt; &amp;larr; Nouns,
not too bad; adjectives, terrible; verbs, I think they are fine.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Anything with adjective, is just BAD!!! Because it invites an endless
question of what you mean by that, and how do you know that!? But
sadly, Chinese language is filled with adjectives, and they are super
proud of that effect, which leads me right to write
&lt;a href="https://fengxia41103.github.io/myblog/euphemism.html"&gt;euphemism&lt;/a&gt;. No, I would argue, stop using adjective as much as you
can. Stop using language as if it says what it means, because no one
knows, no one cares, even the language itself does not know what it is
talking about.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It's just all, mess.&lt;/p&gt;</content><category term="thoughts"></category></entry><entry><title>Integrity</title><link href="https://fengxia41103.github.io/myblog/integrity.html" rel="alternate"></link><published>2018-04-09T00:04:00-04:00</published><updated>2018-04-09T00:04:00-04:00</updated><author><name>Feng Xia</name></author><id>tag:fengxia41103.github.io,2018-04-09:/myblog/integrity.html</id><summary type="html">&lt;p&gt;From 4th grade class weekly message of 4/8/2018:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Starting Monday, we will begin learning about integrity. This is
doing the right thing when nobody is watching. People with integrity
practice what they preach and maintain a consistent pattern of
behavior aligned with their values. They have the courage not to
follow the crowd if it means going against their beliefs. Integrity
is closely linked with the terms of honesty and authenticity. People
with integrity tell the truth and have alignment in their thoughts,
feelings, and behaviors.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Well said, isn't it?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;figure class="col l6 m6 s12"&gt;

&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Just came back from a long trip, I felt this piece described exactly
how I feel what China's current society lacks, integrity.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We had a red eye flight at 1:45am at Pudong airport. I was thinking
   to take the T line 9 &amp;rarr; line 2, which on map gets to Pudong at
   last stop. I also know there is a switch on line 2, four stops
   earlier than the airport stop, that everyone needs to get off the

&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We had a red eye flight at 1:45am at Pudong airport. I was thinking
   to take the T line 9 &amp;rarr; line 2, which on map gets to Pudong at
   last stop. I also know there is a switch on line 2, four stops
   earlier than the airport stop, that everyone needs to get off the
   line 2 train and transit to the other side of the platform for a
   smaller train (and this I never figured out why!? It's such a waste
   of traveller's time and energy, for the benefit of economy?
   energy!? for the few times I travelled on this line, the carts were
   ALWAYS packed! So it wasn't because only few people need to go to
   the airport thus why wasting precious subway space, and could get
   line 2 turn around quicklier that way, too &amp;larr; sorry, not the
   case!)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Anyway, so I looked up online for its schedule, and it was just
&lt;a href="http://service.shmetro.com/en/hcskb/242.htm"&gt;confusing&lt;/a&gt;. That &lt;code&gt;Guanglan Road&lt;/code&gt; stop was the trouble one. So I
saw the extended weekend hour and it was passing midnight. So I
thought this would just work since my flight is 1:45am. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For pure odds, Noah and I got off at Guanglan Road stop around
10pm. Boy, just when we were getting off, a "shorter train" pulled
into the platform on the other side, and everyone, I mean, the
entire passenger who were on line 2, and I'm talking about like 60%
full of the entire train set, started running to that train. I held
Noah back since I figure, well, there would plenty train till
midnight deadline. Then all of sudden, these swarm of people
started evacuating from that train, and just disappeared! In
between, there were a swamp of people asking whether you want a
ride to airport &amp;larr; those so called 黑车 (unauthourized taxi
drivers). &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There were actually staff on board that train, but no one explained
anything! Finally when the entire crowd was completely gone, left
with a few dumb-founded faces, like me and Noah, dragging luggages
and had no idea what is this about, asked a staff, who calmly told
us that &lt;code&gt;the last train to airport is 10pm&lt;/code&gt; &amp;rarr; so there is no
more train! WTF!!?? Then why isn't there any sign, direction,
guideline to tell all these passengers what to do!? and what the
heck running line 2 to passing midnight and having midnight flight
while a 4-stop of distance has to be cut off at a different,
earlier hour!?? What's the rationale!?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I guess there isn't any. And didn't the gov battle these
unauthorized drivers for years!?? well well well, you have just
created this &lt;strong&gt;GIANT NEED&lt;/strong&gt; for their existence! and I would even
say you not only created them, you actually encouraged them to be
in service!! Otherwise, what are these passengers going to do!?
Apparently you are not helping them for sure! You actually kicked
them right into this pothole and watching them to figure it out
completely on their own!!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Geeeee......... this is just, &lt;strong&gt;maddening&lt;/strong&gt;!!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Once we finally got the airport, for all its grandeur and cool
   looking, all terminal gates were shut! and every single passenger
   must enter this building from a single entrance! and it was windy,
   chilly, and regardless where you unboard your vehicle, you must
   walk to that entrance, and there is again, &lt;strong&gt;NO SIGN&lt;/strong&gt;! .. well,
   there was a human sign &amp;larr; they acutally put a poor girl
   standing there to tell all the confused faces "go to entrance
   number 24"... what for!!?? I really don't get it!!! and I can bet
   all doors would be open when the World Repo was holding here!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Just ridiculous!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Then at custom, there was a &lt;strong&gt;single window open&lt;/strong&gt; for poor
   foreigners! A single one! while citizen windows had like 10! and
   the guy who worked there was god damn slow! &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I guess they just love us so much that they didn't want us to
leave.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What a service, and what a country!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And this, is exactly what &lt;strong&gt;integrity&lt;/strong&gt; is about &amp;larr; do things
based on your value, not on impressing someone for a good show! &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Well, I guess these are pretty telling what values this city/country
holds. So really, before you think you are getting back your historical
glory and be the center of universe again, I for one, will not want to
live in that universe at all, because &lt;strong&gt;our value systems surely are
incompatible&lt;/strong&gt; as far as I can tell.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Noah is a taking social intelligence course. A conversation gets me
thinking, what is to measure a social intelligence? My observation of
kids (and adults, too) is that we need &lt;strong&gt;sympathy&lt;/strong&gt; &amp;mdash; the
feeling that your action will affect others in this or that way, and
the uncomfort the others display truly get to you so you feel bad
about it, too. It's hard, actually. How many times you curse the
ass-hole on the road who just speed by you without a slightest concern
what he does affects you one or another.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But, on the other hand, where to draw the line!? You can be doing
things while thinking about how others are going to feel &amp;larr; this
is just not practical, even the intention is certainly sound. I have
discussed this in great length in my &lt;a href="https://fengxia41103.github.io/myblog/hurt feelings.html"&gt;hurt feeling episode&lt;/a&gt;. Then
further down the line, there is broadly used generalization of,
everything! One post in our highschool wechat page is that Arizona
Phoenix sold a piece of property that looks like a China town to a

further down the line, there is broadly used generalization of,
everything! One post in our highschool wechat page is that Arizona
Phoenix sold a piece of property that looks like a China town to a
chinese SOE, and the company is going to tear it down. The outcry is
that if this happens to Phoenix today, it is coming to Chinatown in
Boston, NYC, and so on. Well, this is certainly an exaggerated example
because the &lt;strong&gt;logic of generalization&lt;/strong&gt; is too obvious and too weak to
be defendable &amp;mdash; to me, this is a typical case of tactic of fear
when someone (the author?) uses to stir a public emotion in order to,
not even achieve a goal I'm afraid, but sheer chaos and disturbance.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Another case in the headline news these days is the Florida mass
shooting. Honestly, I can't think of any solution to this,
problem. The shooter is coward, because school will always be a target
for these ppl &amp;mdash; they are vulnerable, easy target, and killing
kids hurt the most, to their family, and to the society. This is an
economic calculation, not even a hatred motivation &amp;mdash; "I want to
maximize the outcome with my hit", or the "why you rob a bank? that's
where the money is." type of logic. If you hate ppl, or society, or
just want to create grief, shooting kids is the logical, optimized
move. How terrible this is!!!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But then, sympathy leads right into generalization &amp;mdash; if it
happened in Florida, it may happen here, to my kids, too. I understand
the feeling. Well, not only I understand, I share this whole
heartedly. Everyday dropping off Noah at school becomes a jittering
experience. A phone call from school reporting "we need to talk to you
that Noah had an incident" is bad and upsetting enough; now
imagine.... god I don't dare to even imagine that! So yes, I share the
grief, share the pain, share the urge to &lt;em&gt;do something&lt;/em&gt; so to prevent
this from happening.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;However, I'm also thinking, are we generalizing!? School shooting
creates an uproar in society because the social image of kids are such
a crown jewel and the least disputable concensus in all society
(pointing me one tribe, group, state, country, religion that kids are
not deemed a near-God status) that it creates the perfect target for
maximizing damage, and also the perfect foundation for generalization
without being challenged. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I don't think anybody wants their kids hurt at school. But, does
anyone want to get cancer? HIV? or hit by a car? or not looking like
Brad Pitt?.... HIV and Cancer are always the poster child of the
uncurable disease. But the fact is, more ppl die from some low-profile
name everyone just shrugs shoulder when hearing them. When was the
last time you heard somebody talking about &lt;a href="https://www.gatesfoundation.org/What-We-Do/Global-Health/Malaria"&gt;malaria&lt;/a&gt;, one thing
made me truly admire what Bill Gates is doing with his fortune and fame!?
And even talking about kids, I listen to &lt;a href="https://www.npr.org/tags/125939032/myanmar"&gt;NPR's report on Myanmar&lt;/a&gt;,
young girls at age of 14 are being exploited, by local women and even
their own family member, as sex slave(!)... and who is making an
outcry for them, why aren't we are generalizing on their behalf!?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Sad, isn't it? So this leads me to another reasoning, that what get
heard, get attention, get front page, is indeed decided by the
attention of ppl, or, what we care about. This sounds like a
cleche. Of course, only ppl's attention will decide what they hear and
care. Then what determines that? education? media? propaganda?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I feel I'm running down a rabbit hole again. Sigh. Human society is
just messy. Sorry, I don't get it, don't have an answer, not even a
clue.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At the mean time, hold on to &lt;code&gt;sympathy&lt;/code&gt; in its generalized term. At
least we should feel sad when others are sad, feel sorry when others
suffer, and try to understand how our acts will affect others,
intentionally or not. That's all.&lt;/p&gt;</content><category term="thoughts"></category><category term="thoughts"></category></entry><entry><title>Moving, and a big trip</title><link href="https://fengxia41103.github.io/myblog/moving.html" rel="alternate"></link><published>2018-03-06T10:00:00-05:00</published><updated>2018-03-06T10:00:00-05:00</updated><author><name>Feng Xia</name></author><id>tag:fengxia41103.github.io,2018-03-06:/myblog/moving.html</id><summary type="html">&lt;figure class="col l6 m6 s12"&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The past weekend was the big moving day. Things actually went pretty
well, except the morning pick up of U-Haul. What a terrible customer
service they had! Well, it started with my fault really by forgetting
to bring my driver license. Nonetheless, the only service was not
helpful &amp;larr; and it's just another example of &lt;a href="https://fengxia41103.github.io/myblog/euphemism.html"&gt;euphemism&lt;/a&gt; that
it gave an error message to retry during business hours of the
self-service pickup location (which was closed for Sunday, btw, wtf!),
and what it really meant, thanks for the last representative who
revealed it to me, was that my account was blocked for any further
self-service and my only option was to find a U-Haul location that was
open and have a real person to help me. Really, once again, euphemism
never works for anybody because &lt;strong&gt;it doesn't specify action to take to
move things forward!&lt;/strong&gt; Make it clear, as precise and actionable as
possible, so to remove and minimize lost in translation. An ambiguity
like that isn't a sign of politeness. Instead, it is a sign of …&lt;/p&gt;</summary><content type="html">&lt;figure class="col l6 m6 s12"&gt;

like that isn't a sign of politeness. Instead, it is a sign of
arrogance and apathy, and smells especially bad in customer service.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Moving is tiring. Really. It's not bad this time to move all the stuff
since most of the stuff are already in boxes (and never left there
since Boston). And also, I like my way of minimal living, that makes
moving less of a heaache, for me, at least. One thing coming out of
this life fiasco is that I learned to live on mininum, and started to
realize how little one needs, physically and materially &amp;mdash; things
you could put away for a week or two, you can safely discard them
without harming your way of living anymore than they would do to you
if being kept around, moved around, attached as if they were necessary
but they are practically useless. On the other hand, a minimal living
emphasizes how much one would need to fill in this gap with mind, with
soul, with emotion, with love, with something inner, someone to miss,
some days to think of, some part of life to regret... &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I miss those days. I miss those people. I read books, give thoughts to
a lot of sayings. I try to make sense of this world, make sense of
people, history, society, try to figure out what is important to me,
important to others, important to Noah. I get angry sometimes, because
those BS annoys me to hell; I get calmer than before, too, because I
can see through so many things and people now that I know what they
are trying to do, and I feel it's really just up to me to decide
whether I want to be part of this BS, if at all (and most likely I
won't be, cause that will annoy me even further because now it will be
myself being part of the annoyance, and I can't get rid of myself,
what a pity).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Friday is approaching. There is actually relief between us because
there is no suspension anymore &amp;mdash; it's done, it will be done. I
have been preaching to Noah that if &lt;strong&gt;it is something you care enough about,
make it happen, don't wait around&lt;/strong&gt;. While saying that I always wonder
on the back of my mind what this meant to us &amp;mdash; do I really care
so much about being official that way? Once upon in life I wished I
were available then to be with her and gave her what she wanted. 
I feel this is a step I'm taking for myself so that myself knows I was
serious, sincere, and truthful. It's how I felt, how I feel, and how I
should have done, for both of them. Timing didn't play out,
again, which is perhaps the theme of my life, or a curse? No
matter. Destiny has its own course, and I don't want to guess nor
expect. Whatever it may be, I am just hoping I can stay true, to
myself and to others I care about &amp;mdash; I sincerely live a life
without ever thinking to hurt or harm the ones I loved and cared. If
consequence of a mistake is hurtful just the same with or without a
sincerity, I think having one is still better than having none. It's a
selfish act I feel &amp;larr; I care how I judge myself, but none how
others judge me.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Is this bad? I don't know. It is my way.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Peace.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;PS. Books and bookshelves make me happy. I like the new bookshelves
and my collection of books. I have been thinking by the day I go away,
which book I would bring with me, if there were only one, or a few? I
don't know yet. I like &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/Practicing-History-Selected-Barbara-Tuchman/dp/0345303636"&gt;Practicing History&lt;/a&gt;. She has a sharp
tongue, and cut-through pen. I like it. While reading it I was always
reminded the line in 冯唐's book that reading book is like conversing
with the author, through time. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And lot of times I felt that she was there, and she is there, though
far far far away, if not in front of my eyes, but in front of my
mind, my heart. There is such a thing as soul mate, I believe, and she
is mine.&lt;/p&gt;</content><category term="thoughts"></category><category term="love"></category></entry><entry><title>A song</title><link href="https://fengxia41103.github.io/myblog/a%20song.html" rel="alternate"></link><published>2018-02-22T09:30:00-05:00</published><updated>2019-03-15T00:00:00-04:00</updated><author><name>Feng Xia</name></author><id>tag:fengxia41103.github.io,2018-02-22:/myblog/a song.html</id><summary type="html">&lt;p&gt;It's a morning that you are touched, by a song.

down before I forget. But now to think of it, it must have been there
all along since I watched the movie some time ago, just didn't surface
till this morning, or that day.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But the song made me think of you. I could feel it, could feel you
tossing around inside me as if you were just sleeping there. How
real. I think that's the power of music, or should I say the power of
missing someone, of loving someone, of wanting someone? Noah was a
great boy today. The day didn't start well for him &amp;mdash; he played
his Prodigy and was happy, until I reminded him of his assignment due
in a few days and he needs to work on it. There was silence, heavy
silence. But then, he picked up his binder and started working on
it. I guess the homework must be quite reasonable because before we
hit I-40 exit he said he is all done! How wonderful!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I remember the night, the moment, when you were next to me, and Noah
was on your segway zooming around. That was a moment in life when I
felt complete, there was nothing I would have asked, nothing. If only
life could have ended at that moment, that would have been nice. Here
he is, growing, still a boy with lots of boyish thoughts and
mischievous ways. He will be fine. But what about you? where are you
these days? and what's your life like? and are you happy?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I don't know how many times you fly through my mind each day. A lot, I
think. Listening to this song I felt this urge to tear, to miss the
ones I have missed in life, the ones who are here no more. I wonder,
maybe that's how one should count his/her age &amp;mdash; by counting how
many lives one has seen its end.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I miss them, Lei, 波波, 臭豆腐, and all the lost loves that had once
bestowed on me, but not anymore. Is this fate? destiny? It is
interesting that last night I came across a line in the &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/Why-West-Rules-Now-Patterns/dp/0312611692"&gt;book&lt;/a&gt;,
which says Buddha is meant to break the cycle of rebirth because life
= suffering. So the idea, I guess, is that once you are out of this
vicious cycle, your suffering ends and that's when you are
&lt;em&gt;saved&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Sometimes I truly feel this is probably how it should go, cause life
certainly is not easy. Then there are all the love vows one makes to the
other person that &lt;em&gt;if not this life, I vow to try again in the next,
and one following till we are together, then we will never part&lt;/em&gt;. How
touching! If looking from this Buddha lens, what this vow says is
an incredible commitment, &lt;strong&gt;that I'm willing to go through another cycle of
life, to suffer, to live through, and may there be even more of these
rounds, because I want to meet you, see you again, and love you
again&lt;/strong&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is indeed a noble thought. You are giving up chance to be saved
in order to fulfill a love you feel about another person (but if you
think of it, how do know s/he has not quit the cycle and has bee saved
already?) well, it does make sense though, maybe that's exactly why
there are people feeling they are not finding the one they want &amp;larr;
because that person has been saved and is not in this cycle anymore!
Oh mine, that's just disappointing, isn't it? Then what? I guess from
what I know about Buddha, the only option now is to save yourself as
quickly as possible so you could join her in that saved land (suppose
the saved are going to the same place. nirvana? heaven? or even hell?
does it matter then if your objective is to find that person and be
with her? even if the place is called hell or whatever, I think it's
irrelevant.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So here it is, a lovely lovely song. I'll hymn it for you, my love,
someday, in some life:&lt;/p&gt;

But what came to my mind this morning was
something quite peculiar, if not irrelevant to the scene &amp;mdash; what

on rock and mineral, and I have just written about
&lt;a href="https://fengxia41103.github.io/myblog/euphemism.html"&gt;euphemism&lt;/a&gt;. This word, science, has been lingering on my mind and
I wonder whether I'm telling Noah the right thing about it.&lt;/p&gt;

truth&lt;/strong&gt; (but what is a truth, or anyone can possibly possess such
thing as truth? I doubt it, if not completly refuting it). So the next
closest thing is, fact!? Here is what &lt;a href="https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/science"&gt;webster&lt;/a&gt; says:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If I'm reading it right, even knowledge is not necessarily fact. Fact,
according to Noah, is something you can prove. But don't you think the
word &lt;em&gt;prove&lt;/em&gt; is also troublesome!? What do you mean by proving? of
your hypothesis, but doesn't it just validate your premise, instead of
what we take &lt;strong&gt;fact as something that is objective&lt;/strong&gt;?
How about turning it around, and say that fact is not something you
can prove right, but prove wrong!? I like &lt;a href="https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/fact"&gt;webster on &lt;code&gt;fact&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;a : something that has actual existence space exploration is now a fact
b : an actual occurrence prove the fact of damage
2 : a piece of information presented as having objective reality These are the hard facts of the case.
3 : the quality of being actual : actuality a question of fact hinges on evidence
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But then again, this seems to lead to more questions than answers
&amp;rarr; what is &lt;em&gt;actuality&lt;/em&gt;? Isn't it also depending on my perception,
or existing regardless of my being? A common example to describe fact,
"this line is 3 feet long" &amp;mdash; but here I would question, if we
both agree on the definition of number system as well as the word
&lt;code&gt;feet&lt;/code&gt;, so the most we could disa/prove is that whether the line meets
what our definition says &amp;rarr; therefore, it is a &lt;strong&gt;hard fact&lt;/strong&gt;, but
only to you and me!! Think of another person from Mars whose &lt;code&gt;feet&lt;/code&gt; is
different, this statement of "3 feet long" is certainly not True
anymore. If you think of it, there isn't a single &lt;em&gt;fact&lt;/em&gt; in this
statement at all!! Are we saying that length of an object is a fact we
can always measure and prove? Not quite so! what is a length? why not
call it width, in Mars system? and who says there is such an attribute
called &lt;code&gt;length&lt;/code&gt; that we commonly link to a physical object? but even
in this sentence there lies a twist &amp;mdash; a line, is virtual!! So
are we saying that length is an attribute applies to both physical and
virtual object? But certainly it is not a required attribute, because,
why can't we have an object that has no concept of length, at all!?
Then what?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;Science, is becoming a disease&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Headache. What I'm really getting to is this. I believe we have turned
the word &lt;code&gt;science&lt;/code&gt; into another label that we freely slap on things
&amp;mdash; I call it window dressing &amp;mdash; and people have bought into
this idea that science is such a vigorous and superior, thing, that it
automatically &lt;strong&gt;validate&lt;/strong&gt; your saying &amp;mdash; that's it! I think what
lies in the core of all these labeling is that speaker has a need to
validate his/her saying... wait a minute, really? why do you want to
validate? I think it's a power you are trying to give yourself so your
message will prevail. If power can come from other mean, validation,
or science in this matter, has a diminishing return, therefore will
just disappear, as we are seeing everyday in politics, media, and many
many other occasions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Makes total sense! why do people want to prevail? To benefit? not
necessarily. A psychological need? This is more likely, but I can't
elaborate what this is. To dominate so to protect him/herself?
hmmm.... this is a likely reason also. As I observed, dressing to be
&lt;em&gt;scientific&lt;/em&gt; is more prevalent when being in a unfriendly crowd
&amp;mdash; if among close friends and family, who the hell care whether
your statement is really valid, or factual, or backed up by numbers or
not. Often enough we even skew the sentence on purpose, just for a
funny effect and laugh.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But then, I hate that these days every argument is &lt;em&gt;traced&lt;/em&gt; back to
our million-year-old ancestor and their survival instinct, as if a
trace of such thing, even a tiny portion among all the other
developed, evolved, changed, updated, attributes, is still sufficient
to make the case. Especially when people bring up the instinct of
survival, well, who doesn't want to survive, first!? Therefore, as
long as your argument traces to your so called survival instinct, it
becomes &lt;em&gt;unreputable&lt;/em&gt; &amp;mdash; &lt;strong&gt;but this to me really is just an
argument bully&lt;/strong&gt;! Don't we all agree, and actually broadcast, that there
have been living example that a subject will not put their survival
instinct on top, when there was something significant enough to
&lt;strong&gt;override your survival instinct&lt;/strong&gt; &amp;larr; such as patriotism,
personal love, and parenthood?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So first, let's make the statement that desire to survive isn't a
sufficient argument why people want to prevail in a crowd. It's a
strong one, but I don't think it's a sufficient one.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Second, science is subjective. It has dominated my generation (and
many before and many to follow), but it is one of many methods we
human use to &lt;strong&gt;make sense&lt;/strong&gt; of this world. Science so far I would say
has developed the most number of tools and methods facilitating this
effort, and have figured out a system to spread its teaching. It seems
to answer the most of number of questions posted by God, but quantity
doesn't speak quality &amp;mdash; &lt;strong&gt;science is not the only tool, the only
method, the only teaching, and its answer is not the only one that
makes sense&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Third, ah ah! don't you also observe that many many many articles
always make to this number so to make the points more, convincing!? I
don't know. There is definitely something about this number in
argument! I actually wonder that three is the capacity of human brain
(for most of us) to summarize information. Anyway, off topic. So I'll
skip number three. I don't have one. Two is fine.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;bogus (science) is epidemic&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If science is viewed in this lens, I would have to rant (more) on how
this technique of &lt;em&gt;window dressing&lt;/em&gt; has become an epidemic in Chinese
scenes. Oh boy I don't even know where to start. Every show you tune
to, every article I have come across in the last two years, everyone I
spoke to and listened to, the word &lt;code&gt;science&lt;/code&gt; is being used left and
right as if we are now in the &lt;strong&gt;age of science&lt;/strong&gt; and are now becoming
a part of this, enlightened?, family.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Sigh. But really, if my message has any value to you, it should be
obvious now that they use the word simply to make a &lt;em&gt;stronger&lt;/em&gt; case
for themselves whatever their agenda is. &lt;strong&gt;Science is a view, and as
any other view, it is personal, it is subjective, it is fallible, and
it is debatable&lt;/strong&gt; (.... almost did 3 myself!) Throwing numbers around
isn't science, isn't scientific. Quoting a research finding without
first stating its assumption and experiment methods, and in particular
its reasoning, is simply slogan shouting, and is just wrong, I mean,
morally, wrong!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I don't believe there is a &lt;em&gt;correct&lt;/em&gt; science. But I do think there is
&lt;em&gt;bogus science&lt;/em&gt; &amp;mdash; definition being one that omit definition of
its premises and presenting conclusions/opinions with a illogical
reasoning. One sign of a bogus science is that its statements are
loaded with adjectives such as &lt;em&gt;many, much, very, most&lt;/em&gt; &amp;mdash; and
conversations on stocks and medication are the worst &amp;mdash; you know
this stock CAN fall up to 20%.... why can't it fall 21%? or 100%? or
-200%? of course it can, and you can't even state how like it CAN! A
line like this, is what I would call a bogus science &amp;larr; it slapped
a fine, scientific number on itself, but it has zero information nor 
validation.&lt;/p&gt;</content><category term="thoughts"></category><category term="thoughts"></category></entry><entry><title>To Nianyi</title><link href="https://fengxia41103.github.io/myblog/to%20nianyi.html" rel="alternate"></link><published>2018-02-14T13:21:00-05:00</published><updated>2018-06-07T15:00:00-04:00</updated><author><name>Feng Xia</name></author><id>tag:fengxia41103.github.io,2018-02-14:/myblog/to nianyi.html</id><summary type="html">&lt;p&gt;Hi,&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Haven't been a while since I wrote you anything. I'm listening to this

&lt;p&gt;I want to say I'm sorry, sorry for being such a ass recently, for not

and thickness of life with you as I have promised. Up to recent week I

could turn around and realize how难得we had …&lt;/p&gt;</summary><content type="html">&lt;p&gt;Hi,&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Haven't been a while since I wrote you anything. I'm listening to this
movie while working, and felt I have something to say to you.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I want to say I'm sorry, sorry for being such a ass recently, for not

family and am moving away. I'm sorry. I feel very very sad. I wanted

things to you and Noah in a nice way, to be patient with him, and you,
and this family, and our situation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I'm sorry. I don't have those anymore. I lost patience, lost
willingness to save our marriage, lost courage to go through the thin
and thickness of life with you as I have promised. Up to recent week I
still though I had a chance to revive your feeling, and maybe you
could turn around and realize how难得we had come along these many
years, though filled with many happinesses, also moments of laugh,
lightness, fun, love.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But I can't hold on to this wishful thinking any longer. Tian Wentong
told me you two had a chat while in Beijing, and you have already
determined back then. I don't mean to blame in any way. I just wished
you could have told me this earlier. This is the same struggle I have
had with you for the last five years, maybe even longer, that I just
don't know what your thoughts are. I don't know whether it's my being
insensitive thus missed all the signs and cues you must have had for
me along the way. I honestly did not see them. I apologize that I
haven't been smarter than I had been, so I could have been a good
husband and partner, and could have avoided all these stressful days I
have caused you and Noah. I'm sorry.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is a lost battle. I don't know what could have saved us. I tried
to get away, tried to find love, tried to come back, tried to heal
myself with other women. In the end, I'm further and further away from
you, and you are further and further away from me. I used to think I
could not live without Noah. But now, I sometimes want to get away
from him, too, and this thought scares me. I don't know what is going
wrong with me. I'm sad, just sad. My brain is still spinning as fast
as ever, but my feelings are cold, distant, and sad.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Pls don't blame this on the girls and women I met and brought into our
life. If there were fault and penalty, I should be the one to
bear. Period. They were all loving people with a warm heart and a
lovely soul. I was not in a position to give them what they want. Yet
I didn't resist their intimacy because they made me feel live again. I
have been selfish in this regard; I wanted to. I know what I was
doing, and I made the choices without regret. So whatever they lead
to, such as the moment like right now, I should face it, deal with it,
and live it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I feel sorry these made you unhappy, if they did. I don't dare to
guess such things anymore, because you are becoming a mystery to me. I
don't even know whether you care, and if you do, why you care. It's
still important to me, but I lost all touch of your inside, and thus
am less than a stranger you are willing to chat on the street.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Such a long time, the past 9 years we somehow crawled through. I don't
know who else can bear with me for this long, and give what you
gave. I used to believe there must be someone who cherish what I have;
but I am not confident of that anymore. I know I'll continue to meet
someone. But the courage needed to tie a knot and to give promise is
thinner than ever. This is sad. I yearn for companionship; yet, I fail
over and over to live in one. What you and I had were the closest to a
family life I had in mind. Love is like soil to me &amp;mdash; one can
live without, but one can't stand without.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I constantly think over the women I had in my life, lovable,
beautiful, regretful. I did good with some, and failed with others. I
had the best chance with you, yet here I am, finding a place for
myself so we will call it over. Noah used to be a string attached me
to this family so I will come back. But even he is becoming a lose
string now. And I always know this is a losing battle if we just
maintain the status quo &amp;mdash; nothing will stop him from growing up
and becoming more and more independent. This string that attaches you
and me, will have be let go sooner or later. Then, what we two still
have left to glue us together instead of drifting apart?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I am tired now, and am old now. I often think of death, and last days
in my life, like a movie rolling in front of eyes. It is not scary,
but too many regrets. I wish I could have known better back then,
could have been less self-confident self-important self-centric back
then, have been older, or younger, when I met you and them, could have
had different personality and patience level when dealing with our
issues back in 2012 and 2013, could have been nicer to Noah and you in
recent months, could have been a less sentimental person, could have
just been an asshole regular common averagely-educated
pickup-truck-driving man so I don't feel or care that much.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I'm sorry I'm pulling away. There is nothing left for me to try. I
used to hate the idea that we are to pay two rents instead of one,
while these money could have been used for Noah's college fund, or a
nice decor in living room. But I realized how weak and unrealistic
such thought is &amp;mdash; it's an engineer's urge for maximum efficiency
I guess. Since there are million other women I'm willing to look at
all live with their own rents and places, &lt;code&gt;low efficiency&lt;/code&gt; is the
reality, not the other way around. So what to deter us living in the
same pattern then? None. I realized that if we go apart, we each will
start to live our own life, and therefore there is no point to think
about the ridiculous &lt;code&gt;saving&lt;/code&gt; we could have achieved otherwise.  How
slow am I to grasp this idea when it must have been completly obvious
to everyone? I wish this realization could have come earlier, so I
could have not dragged you along in the last 5 years and caused you
frustration and agony. I'm sorry. I'm learning, just always too late.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Our marriage is not nourished to either of us. Noah is not learning to
communicate, to interact, to handle intimacy, to see a fun smiling
parents together. I feel bad I didn't figure out, nor strong enough to
come over this. I know all these will become so unimportant when
another 10-20 years pass by, just like how we look at the things that
bothered us to hell that many years back. Time doesn't heal; time
doesn't make us forget either; time just makes sense less and less
tender till it couldn't feel much anymore.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Hopefully I will find a place soon so you don't have to look at my
temper and rudeness anymore. This place will still be yours, if it's
ok with you. I wanted to have you pick one you like. But my strength
and my wish to save our relationship burned out. I hate how I'm
treating you and him. So I have to change this by staying away.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Thank you for the marriage, for tolerating me, for allowing me to stay
with her last year, for putting so much in this family and Noah's
life. I probably won't be able to shoulder much of your burden in the
future anymore. So, take care. If in need, I'm still willing to help.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Sigh. Life is indeed full of puzzling person and phenomenon that
annoys me and I found myself always wonder why they do that and what I
have done to make them act that way (or regardless what I have done
and do, they are just like that). Why?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The new house is coming together nicely. All the good decisions were
made and the outcome is really satisfying. Bill is a good guy. But
then, communication with him is just not there &amp;mdash; calling him
didn't usually feel welcomed, and calling me always starts 7is in the
morning (regardless the day of the week) and it's always when I needed
to pay him. How, one way, ish. After getting off that annoying phone
conversation with him, I was thinking that this is both entertaining
and annoying &amp;mdash; I thought I'm an angry old man. Well, here he is,
an even angri&lt;strong&gt;er&lt;/strong&gt; than I am &amp;mdash; funny, and rude. Oh well well,
no harm done, so be it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Sigh. Life is indeed full of puzzling person and phenomenon that
annoys me and I found myself always wonder why they do that and what I
have done to make them act that way (or regardless what I have done
and do, they are just like that). Why?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The new house is coming together nicely. All the good decisions were
made and the outcome is really satisfying. Bill is a good guy. But
then, communication with him is just not there &amp;mdash; calling him
didn't usually feel welcomed, and calling me always starts 7is in the
morning (regardless the day of the week) and it's always when I needed
to pay him. How, one way, ish. After getting off that annoying phone
conversation with him, I was thinking that this is both entertaining
and annoying &amp;mdash; I thought I'm an angry old man. Well, here he is,
an even angri&lt;strong&gt;er&lt;/strong&gt; than I am &amp;mdash; funny, and rude. Oh well well,
no harm done, so be it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;history, euphemism&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Reading &lt;em&gt;"Practicing History: Selected Essays"&lt;/em&gt; by &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Barbara_W._Tuchman#Books"&gt;Barbara
Tuchman&lt;/a&gt;, I am deeply shocked how terrible track record of
human had been and how ugly
the outlook of current days would be (and already have been). 
It's really disturbing and sad.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The good news is that I found a new word, &lt;strong&gt;euphemism&lt;/strong&gt;, I feel it's
exactly the noun I have been searching for to describe those &lt;a href="https://fengxia41103.github.io/myblog/irresponsible response.html"&gt;bloated
response&lt;/a&gt; of Chinese language I have been complaining about. I'm
not sure I agree with its dictionary description, but I can see the
root of it is that an act of window dressing to make something sounds
&lt;em&gt;prettier, better&lt;/em&gt; than it actually is, with a motive of what!? In the
oriental world the common perception is that the drive of saving-face
is a strong argument. But honestly I now fail to see the line between
face-saving and trickery &amp;mdash; by dressing up and avoiding a
clarification of the words in use, I would argue that you are just
giving me a false impression and leading me astray, often with a
deliberate intention of such false effect as the outcome! Isn't this
trickery or what!?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I really enjoyed her words on history because she stated clearly the
words she meant, and her stands on things she discussed. See, this is
what a historian or any profession should do &amp;mdash; a thinker who
questions order given in a broader sense than his/her own job and
command chain, derives an opinion and judgment with your own argument,
and take a stand for question and discussion. It's hard, confusing,
destructive, anti-progress, anti-many-status-quos, but it is
necessary, must.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;technology != True. Period.&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Her words led to think more about my profession &amp;mdash;
technology. Yes I have had this feeling recently that words like
"education", "technology", "science" have been misused as if it's
outlook is unquestionably good and its cause universally agreed! &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But far from it I'm afraid. Not only its outcomes have been proven to
be a disaster (in history) in many many places and periods, but its
ingredient and reasoning have been borrowed by too many statements so
they are now universally used, but hardly understood and checked!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Everybody talks about &lt;em&gt;science&lt;/em&gt; as if anything now prefix-ed by the
word becomes a &lt;em&gt;valid&lt;/em&gt; offer. Really!? I was thinking the Chinese word
xx学, what does it mean!? Is it science? is it research? or is it
knowledge? For science, I think we are talking about a pattern that is
recognized, has predictable output when given a known input. We
believe we know the mechanics that converts the input into output, in
a understandable, documented fashion.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Technology, on the other hand, is far from it. It is nowadays being
used as if itself is the answer to problem. &lt;strong&gt;Not at all!&lt;/strong&gt; Technology
is at most a method, and I would even take this further to say that
it is an opinionated implementation of something. What it brings us is
efficiency, what it derives is a query into the &lt;em&gt;problem&lt;/em&gt; (if there
wasn't a definition of problem, it will create at one version; if
there is a version to work with, it throws more dimensions at it so we
know more about that &lt;em&gt;problem&lt;/em&gt; after) so we get more insights. **In
the end, it is a mechanics to facilitate discussion, not an ultimate
solution as many many Powerpoints are preaching.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In today's atmosphere I feel the equation of &lt;strong&gt;technology=science&lt;/strong&gt; is
becoming a conceptual pattern. Even more disturbing is that it has
been extended to become &lt;strong&gt;technology=data, technology=science,
science=True&lt;/strong&gt;, therefore &lt;strong&gt;data=True&lt;/strong&gt;! Oh mine. I don't even think
euphemism is sufficient to describe this fear of mine &amp;mdash; this is
utterly insane, and false, and unacceptable!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;let me try to argue&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And here is my argument.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;technology&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;First, technology is a tool, like a hammer, that we need to first say
&lt;strong&gt;the task is to knock a nail&lt;/strong&gt;! Without that, hammer itself is a
neutral, meaningless, piece of metal on a wood stick. It will then
become a weapon if the 2nd piece is now stating &lt;strong&gt;the task is to wave
and knock down that guy charging at you with a katana&lt;/strong&gt; &amp;mdash; you
see the point? Technology itself should not be elevated to a
Sainthood. It doesn't deserve it, and it never says so
itself. Technology is a powerful tool, but the user who swings that
hammer and the goal of that swing are what we should be discussing,
questioning, and debating. Throwing the buzz word "based on the latest
greatest technology" is confusing and BS.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Technology is just a tool. It requires a definition of the task to
achieve, and its effectiveness is at mercy of its user.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;knowledge, truth&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Second, there may not be a truth, but there is knowledge, and the
purpose of gaining knowledge is &lt;strong&gt;not to seek truth&lt;/strong&gt;. I don't believe
there is truth, absolute or not (I think in common thinking we also
have an equation of &lt;strong&gt;fact=truth&lt;/strong&gt;. I'll accept that definition, then
it still holds that &lt;strong&gt;data!=fact, therefore data!=truth&lt;/strong&gt;)
Therefore, it doesn't compute if it is the
goal of anything. What is a knowledge then? I can only think of a
definition that knowledge is a &lt;strong&gt;personal awareness&lt;/strong&gt; of (input &amp;rarr; output)
pair (the "&amp;rarr;" stands for a transformation mechanics). Yes, it is
subjective, and it has no right or wrong. I know this sounds quite
strange. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Knowledge is subjective. It is defined as &lt;code&gt;output =
transformation(input)&lt;/code&gt;. Truth, if exists, = facts.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;data&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It is both funny and sad witnessing Chinese talks swing from
complete ignorance of data and digitizing information (so to gain
conformity, consistency, and efficiency) to these days &lt;em&gt;data
everywhere&lt;/em&gt; as if data is a truth. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Of course not! Data is a presentation of information, that's it. You
can certainly point at someone's photo and make statement that he is a
bad guy (you actually mean &lt;em&gt;he looks like a bad guy&lt;/em&gt;, or &lt;em&gt;he has a bad
guy's look&lt;/em&gt;? I'm not sure even yourself knows which one you meant!?),
but no one is going to take that as fact or &lt;em&gt;truth&lt;/em&gt; because it is just
one look of that person's million dimensions, and you didn't even give
the definition of your knowledge equation of  (look &amp;rarr; bad guy)!
See!? You need to define:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;what is a &lt;code&gt;look&lt;/code&gt;?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;what is the transformation mechanism?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;what is a &lt;code&gt;bad guy&lt;/code&gt;?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Only then, your statement based on data becomes clear. But no one says
your equation is &lt;em&gt;accurate&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;em&gt;valid&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;em&gt;correct&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;em&gt;True&lt;/em&gt;! Therefore,
having data itself does not (in)validate anything. It is an ingredient
to establish a reasoning which always depends on the view point of the
analyst and the process that logics are derived!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Data, has information. But it is not fact (and leave Truth out of this
will be wise).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Data is another form of information. Information can be used to
reconstruct a fact. But even that is a far-fetched wish because then
who is defining that &lt;strong&gt;fact&lt;/strong&gt;?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I feel it is a lost battle. &lt;/p&gt;</content><category term="thoughts"></category><category term="thoughts"></category></entry><entry><title>Big D</title><link href="https://fengxia41103.github.io/myblog/the%20big%20D.html" rel="alternate"></link><published>2018-02-04T09:30:00-05:00</published><updated>2018-06-07T15:00:00-04:00</updated><author><name>Feng Xia</name></author><id>tag:fengxia41103.github.io,2018-02-04:/myblog/the big D.html</id><summary type="html">&lt;p&gt;This has been a long past due as I have been thinking about this for

&lt;p&gt;But yes, I felt sad. I felt I was letting people down, without knowing
what's laying ahead, and knowing I have broken a vow that I casted
sincerely, whole-heartedly, believed, wanted, proud of, but now have
failed her, and myself, and the principle I have been preaching to
Noah, that don't make a promise that you can't keep, and I always
thought that is one thing I have held, and will hold true to myself,
to others who have come across and will come across my path, that I
can and will keep a promise I made &amp;amp; make. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yet, here I am, sitting here, and have broken THE promise I have made to a
person I loved, cared more than myself, at really not much of her own,
have turned into someone I now can not look straight into eyes when we
talk. So sad. Really. How could any vow be trustworthy anymore? how
could any promise be held to its end anymore? How could I have peace
with myself after I have betrayed the one thing I dear, and the one
person I deared, anymore?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="divider"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Hi,&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is a letter I have been wanting to write, for the last few days
at least, but don't know where to start or how to send. But let me
try.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I want to say, I am really really sorry, that it has finally come to
this. I feel sorry I have let you down, have let Noah down, and is the
one breaking up a family we have. I am really sorry. On one hand I
felt it's been long past due, that it should have ended a long time
ago so the agonies we have experienced in the past few years would not
have been necessary; on the other hand it never feels a &lt;em&gt;right&lt;/em&gt; moment
to do this. It is like watching your own child or pet sick in bed but
all you could do is watching it slowly fade, weaken, and die.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I don't know. I have this resentment inside me against you, which made
my both unpleasant, rude, and unhealthy, not only to you, but to
anyone around me. I used to resent you not trying to save or to change
our situation. But I also question myself whether I have tried, and
what I have tried. I tried to go away, try to make my absence a
painful reminder to you of what we had, met two in my life who,
inevitably, left a mark on our breakdown, one smartly chose another
man better than what I could give her, and one spoiled me with her
love and beauty to put me back on my feet.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I am the lucky one. I always had wonderful women in my life, from the
first girl I met, to you, to siqi. I couldn't help now facing the
harsh reality that it must have been me who have disappointed you all,
by not being wise when I need to, not being sensitive when I need to,
not being respectful, or forceful, or independent, or mature, or any
of the adjectives that woman wishes in a man, when it should have been
there.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Sometimes I thought of those blant riches who claim not to marry until
he has enough money to give his woman comfort and style. I still can't
bring myself to approve this view. But I see its merit now &amp;mdash; it
is better, more responsible I think, to provide your loved one such
things, than expecting her to be on your side thick or thin
unconditionally &amp;mdash; it's an idealistic version of love life, but
not life itself.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I want to thank you for the years when I was jobless, wondering around
with a bloated ego but a pathetic understanding of you. I really
enjoyed the years in MBA, and the days when I felt at the brink of
fortune and fame. But more and more with each day passes, I hate the
version of me in those days because I was ego-centric,
self-importance, self-centered, short-tempered, aggressive, and greed
of success to prove myself. Looking back, it is also a double-edged
sword, that having you and this family made me proud, gave me
confidence, resulting in an enlarged ego, which in turn led me astray
&amp;mdash; in the process of building a better life for the ones I cared,
I lost the ones along the way.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;How pity was I! If you have seen through all these back then, I would
have to say that you are indeed wiser than I realized, and which makes
me even more in debt that you have still agreed to be with
me. Ten-year is not the longest of a personal relationship I have
experienced, but is most intimate one of that length, and certainly a
fruitful one because of Noah. I sometime think of him whether he is a
bond or a bond-breaker. What would be us without him? would less
stress from raising a child have made things easier? better? or worse?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I don't know. On his good days I had no doubt he is the best decision
having made; then on the others I wonder what I have done. He is
fine. He will grow, regardless how we raise him or what we give him,
or not give him. My resentment used to be caused by imagining an ideal
life for him that he now is going to miss. But truth is, he will be
fine. He will adopt a life of his own, and however we think we have
shaped that, it will not be. There will be residual memories of how we
have conducted things that he will recall, will take in, and will
apply. But the majority of him will be picked up randomly from him
school, his friends, his hours and days when none of us is
around. There is the influence of genes; then there is the influence
of the world.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Whiling reading those disturbing books, sometimes I even wonder
whether bringing him to this world is a good or a bad thing. Life is
hard. I have yet to come across anyone whose life isn't &amp;mdash; there
is always a seemingly glory on surface, with torrents of trouble
underneath. Five years ago it scared me to think of separation,
logistic headaches, and the gloomy prospect of future life. Now, I
think it's just there, whether separation or not, different set of
problems, but equally challenging, agonizing, and scary. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I think it's better this way, at least no suspense. One day I was
driving and was thinking over financial statement analysis, a book I
am reading, a line suddenly occurred to me, if I were a comedian
standing on a stage, is that "If you are a disorganized person or
company, how should you manage you finance!?  Just take on a shit load
of debt, so now the banks and lenders will put together the best
statement and analysis of you yourself don't even know how to, and will
also watch your progress in such a keen spirit that no change will
escape. So now just for free, you have an army of experienced
accountant, analyst, finance expert, to work for you, for free! ha,
ha, ha" Because, by doing so, there is no analysis needed anymore, no
suspense, no prediction of how well you will be doing if I lend you
money &amp;mdash; you are in debt, done. I think this principle applies in
life.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Instead of keeping a suspense, I am dropping the other shoe, so it is
now done, and we can all react to it with fact, not guessing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;With Noah between us, there will always be a tie uncut. So I don't
think this will be the LAST letter to you. But if I do end up dead
tomorrow or the next moment, at least I wrote down everything I want
to say at this moment, and made it available to you. Since I have
failed to keep a promise I held dear, I should be extra truthful and
honest, so that I would, by the time of my death bed, claim myself
an honest person. I used to think high of myself with many good
traits. Now, I only wish I could win this last defense. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I meant to say sorry when I handed you the notification, but I
didn't. I was afraid of tears, emotion, and waver of this decision. I
retreat to this mean I know of, by writing and email. I think it's
better to write, as it gives me a chance to reflect, to organize my
thoughts, to re-read and re-check, so I know I am speaking with
understanding of what I am saying, and what it may bring.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I am really really sorry. I let you down. But now you are free, and I
can not hold on anymore. What I owed, I don't know how to
repay, and can not repay with any satisfactory conclusion; 
what I may help, I will be there. I may drift now in life and in
space, so I don't know where I will be eventually. But I will make 
myself available if you ask. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I have to say, I haven't read an entertaining book as &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/Paul-Fussell-American-1983-10-16-Hardcover/dp/B0197PAO4U/ref=la_B000AQ6OIQ_1_17?s=books&amp;amp;ie=UTF8&amp;amp;qid=1517092280&amp;amp;sr=1-17&amp;amp;refinements=p_82%3AB000AQ6OIQ"&gt;Class&lt;/a&gt; for a
long time. This book is just stimulating, fun, and sharp. It actually
hurts. It describes sooo accurately of what I feel about many
aspects/signals in life that I come off with a much clearer idea of
what all these things are about and why they exist and behave in such
a way.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Super interesting. One thing for sure, Noah will be a middle-class
man, because I simply do not possess the attributes of the uppers,
thus having no ability to teach him that. Yet I truly wish he would
become one someday, not implying the fortune or the fame, but their
carefree of others' opinion, their accurate use of words in its
essence and intent, their blunt expression without ambiguity, and
their dismiss of artifacts created without practical purpose.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is brilliant! Really. I have been agonized by proliferating use
of adjectives both in my own language and others for a while (even
this exact sentence is full of adjectives …&lt;/p&gt;</summary><content type="html">&lt;figure class="col s12"&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is brilliant! Really. I have been agonized by proliferating use
of adjectives both in my own language and others for a while (even
this exact sentence is full of adjectives I feel redundant, harmful!).
I could not get to the bottom of it. I realized that adding more
adjectives make the sentence long and &lt;em&gt;richer&lt;/em&gt; (it seems), thus giving
(or I should say, &lt;em&gt;I, the speaker, hope&lt;/em&gt;) a sense sophistication and
profoundness &amp;mdash; but really many many times I felt it is a
cover-up job because I (the speaker) simply lack the accurate
understanding of the topic, thus having to pile up &lt;em&gt;big words&lt;/em&gt; and
adjectives so to describe it with an attempt to be &lt;em&gt;accurate&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Well, at least in my case the intention is to make it more accurate
than what my mind is capable to describe. There are another army of
cases (that just annoyed me to hell, whenever I hear them in speech,
see them in writing, or smell them in the air!) whose sole purpose is
pretentious (learned this word from this book, what a lovely
word!). Ah, how about another word, &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Euphemism"&gt;euphemism&lt;/a&gt; &amp;mdash; this is
exactly what I talked about China's booming degradation of its
language &amp;mdash; people are proud of speaking in riddles as if it
carries more information than it contains. But the only effect is 
misunderstanding, anxiety, and completly irresponsibility of the
speaker because the words are &lt;strong&gt;intentionally infallible,
ambiguous, and keeping audience in perpetual suspense!&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When upper says "I want my daughter's wedding to be right", I think
they have a clear picture in mind of what is right (and certainly what
is wrong). However, when the word "right" is being used pretentiously,
neither its speaker nor its audience dares to stand up for a
definition &amp;mdash; the speakers feels superior to audience because
s/he has just used an infallible word whose &lt;strong&gt;correctness is implied,
inherent, built-in&lt;/strong&gt;; the audiences wonder whether they didn't get it
just because they are stupid.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;How sad. How outrageous! This is not merely ridiculous, this is
absolutely bad. I am glad to come across this book, not because I
agree with his view of society (or even class divisions), but a sharp
tongue to remove those seemingly &lt;em&gt;elegant, civilized, sophisticated&lt;/em&gt;
items in life. This is a book all marketing people should read, study,
discuss, and apply &amp;mdash; I always believe good sales is about a good
understanding of the group (segment, but now we should just say
&lt;em&gt;class&lt;/em&gt;), about their human desire (of a projected image of
themselves, eg. the collectible item example in this book, or the
British product name, and of course the easy way to show $$ by
dangling a &lt;strong&gt;luxury&lt;/strong&gt; handbag with bling-bling name plate, and
fondness of &lt;strong&gt;personalizing&lt;/strong&gt; anything). If I have citicized
&lt;a href="https://fengxia41103.github.io/myblog/marketing.html"&gt;marketing&lt;/a&gt; before, I will emphasize my view once again &amp;mdash;
stop thinking you are smarter than your buyers by &lt;em&gt;selling your ideas
to them&lt;/em&gt;! On the contrary, your success relies on you &lt;strong&gt;learning their
ideas&lt;/strong&gt; &amp;mdash; you see, the whole team of China &lt;em&gt;marketing gurus&lt;/em&gt; 
is getting this reversed!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So, call it whatever you want, and feel free to agree or disagree this
book however you feel. The point I make here isn't about the &lt;em&gt;class&lt;/em&gt;
descriptions, isn't about signals to identify and categorize anyone,
anything into a 9-grade system. It's the spirit of being practical,
being truthful to oneself and to others, being real &amp;mdash; if you
don't know something, just say it, "I don't know anything about it."&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This goes to all used &lt;strong&gt;broadly, freely,
carelessly&lt;/strong&gt; in China these days &amp;mdash; 专家，老师，先生，大数据，人工智能...&lt;/p&gt;</content><category term="thoughts"></category><category term="thoughts"></category></entry><entry><title>Society</title><link href="https://fengxia41103.github.io/myblog/society.html" rel="alternate"></link><published>2018-01-23T11:50:00-05:00</published><updated>2018-01-23T11:50:00-05:00</updated><author><name>Feng Xia</name></author><id>tag:fengxia41103.github.io,2018-01-23:/myblog/society.html</id><summary type="html">&lt;figure class="col l6 m6 s12"&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I  have   been  doing  a   lot  of  thinking  recently,   about  human
society. There are multiple themes in my life and in my thinkings that
I find them interesting, disturbing, annoying, and saddening. The more
books  I'm reading  about  historical  events and  views,  the more  I
question how a  society, or any society, can survive  and develop, and
whether there  is a  pattern (or  lesson to  learn from)  that propels
their initiation, growth, and declination?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I don't know. Human society is messy. That's the only word I can think
of. Listening to NPR makes this  feeling stronger all the time &amp;mdash;
I  actually  feel sorry  for  government  officials, politicians,  and
advocates who are  either in a position to &lt;em&gt;serve&lt;/em&gt;  the people, and to
help  &lt;em&gt;all&lt;/em&gt;. It's  an illusion  that, in  my opinion,  both wrong  and
impossible. I'm not sure how much they really believe in what they are
saying and preaching, and they are set out to do. Chances are, I would
dare to bet, they are feeling  the conflicts within themselves all the

they are in a position that  they have to pretend, not necessarily for
fame  and  glory,  but  for their  survival  and  reconciliation  with
themselves.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;tested&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is sad.  Reading the book &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/Auschwitz-New-History-Laurence-Rees-ebook/dp/B004OA64GG/ref=sr_1_3?s=books&amp;amp;ie=UTF8&amp;amp;qid=1516726556&amp;amp;sr=1-3&amp;amp;keywords=auschwitz"&gt;Auschwitz&lt;/a&gt; made me  wonder how deep
the  rabbit hole  goes!? It  strikes me  when the  German commando  of
concentration camp questioned how someone  who had not been &lt;strong&gt;tested&lt;/strong&gt;
could be his judge? This is very  true I think. If you haven't been in
that situation,  you really don't know  how much yourself is  going to
change, and  how much that toxic  environment is going to  modify your
behavior and thinking. For these natiz criminals (this I have no doubt
that they have  done the anti-humanity act not out  of their excuse of
&lt;em&gt;following the order&lt;/em&gt;, but out of  a balanced decision of &lt;em&gt;benefit and
cost&lt;/em&gt;  &amp;mdash;  it  could  have   been  completly  rational  at  their
individual level),  at least  they have  done what  they have  done in
those context, and we  know how low they had been.  But because of the
extreme characteristics of those act,  it should also raise a question
mark on  the head of  everyone else who  is being judgmental  of being
right or wrong.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I know there were many great examples and people who did not fall into
the low in the same overall circumstances. But do they then serve as a
proof of  human strength?  I mean,  how much  can we  generalize these
attributes against the ugly ones? What I see is an alarming pattern of
people who submit themselves to the oppression as a majority's choice,
this echoes  the same question  I asked  小舅 about why  people didn't
revolt during the Culture Revolution. I  don't know what is the theory
behind this,  but it has been  demonstrated over and over  and over in
Holocust of any form, and which could only mean that this reaction and
mechanism is a built-in part of human  &amp;rarr; so as long as you and me
are human, we own this attribute,  and will &lt;strong&gt;inevitably&lt;/strong&gt; at mercy of
its effect. But how to interpret heroes and heroic acts in those times
then?  They  were  human,  too.  Why didn't  they  suffer  from  these
built-ins?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I don't know. I wonder whether it  is again a trick of labeling that I
have been  debating with myself recently  (a lot). You see,  we take a
certain  type  of  act  as  being  heroic,  while  viewing  others  as
criminal. But what is the criteria  to judge them? Law? isn't law also
written by a  bunch human? then who says their  opinions should be the
&lt;em&gt;law&lt;/em&gt;? To that  matter, there are many words I  start to question (but
no answer yet):&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;science&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;hate vs. love&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;race&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;discrimination&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I feel they have been over-used in such a blanket fashion that it's
really an abuse now.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;science&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Science is being spoken as if itself is a Truth, a good thing. No.  It
is a view, an opinion, just like all others. Its difference from
previous Gods and superstitions is that its equations and
interpretations can in some cases predict the future &amp;mdash; when is
the next total eclipse? But quoting something as &lt;em&gt;scientific&lt;/em&gt; in many
many discussions is not even centered around this, but as a
take-for-granted attitude that science is better than (whatever your
argument is).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;No, no no! This is just BS. This is what I call &lt;strong&gt;labelling&lt;/strong&gt;. You
slap a label called scientific onto your argument, and violla, yours
become valid, accurate, and better &amp;mdash; or do they!? I would
immediately challenge:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;What is your definition of &lt;em&gt;being scientific&lt;/em&gt;? &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;What is your proof that yours is &lt;em&gt;scientific&lt;/em&gt;? (and mine isn't)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Why yous being &lt;em&gt;scientific&lt;/em&gt; is therefore better than [blank, fill
   in whatever you are arguing about]?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Exactly. Science is not a catch-all phrase. It does &lt;strong&gt;requires&lt;/strong&gt; a way
of thinking (through experiment and quantification), which is being
highly regarded by current human race. But objectively speaking, it is
on an equal footing with other views of this world. I think its power
lies in two folds, which makes it a implementation (for the time
being, my life for sure):&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;its &lt;strong&gt;much-more-likely-to-be-true&lt;/strong&gt; predictability than other
  methods on a day-to-day minute-to-minute basis. &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;its ability to &lt;strong&gt;uncover more of what we didn't and don't know&lt;/strong&gt;,
  eg. was the earth round, or flat?  how to identify a place on the
  earth globe (using a
  tuple of longitude and latitude numbers.)  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But when somebody claiming
his is scientific without addressing the above three questions, he
is lying, abusing this word, and is exactly being unscientific.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;hate vs. love&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This came from a conversation w/ Noah in car. I commented on a &lt;em&gt;bad
driver&lt;/em&gt; (in my personal perception), and he said he has a word to
describe this &amp;mdash; fxxx. Certainly I don't want to encourage him
using such word. But also it became to me that you &lt;strong&gt;need something to
describe such a strong feeling&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Any human will develop these emotions, and who can really say one
emotion is &lt;em&gt;good&lt;/em&gt; and another is &lt;em&gt;bad&lt;/em&gt;? I mean, what do you mean by
calling it good? Any kid will learn these emotions eventually, and
they exist as a matter of fact. You need all of them to live this life. So
hate is just another strong emotion that will occur someday.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I think the real difference is at handling these emotions. But again,
if you view something as negative, you will try to avoid and punish
it. So we have anger control, we have &lt;em&gt;don't make war, make love&lt;/em&gt;
&amp;mdash; the underline assumption is that love is better than hate. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I found this curious. Not only they are both strong feelings I have
argued to be perfectly valid to exist, but also I challenge why hate
is a worse feeling than love!? Is it because hate is going to cause
more harm to oneself and others? This is a good point I can
accept. But then does it mean how much harm is the criteria to judge?
Sounds so, then how much harm is ok, or just any harm is bad? and
further, harm to whom? What if my hate only harm me? or is there such
a thing as &lt;strong&gt;an isolated harm, or isolated me&lt;/strong&gt;?  You see, very
quickly this logic is running into a subjective domain that I don't
think anyone has a clue.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Even further, as we all know the cliche, hate and love are like twins
&amp;mdash; they feed each other, support each other, and become each
other! So really, I don't see hate is being bad at all. It is just a
strong feeling that one needs to handle. But the hard question
emerges, how to handle!? suppress? limit? encourage? aren't all these
already based on a pre-conclusion that these are negative, bad,
therefore should be handled with suppression!?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I don't know. I feel I'm chasing my own tails.
So the conversation with Noah &amp;mdash; the
F-word is one way to express that strong feeling you feel, but not the
only one. The consequence of using it can be a fight. So if you are
prepared to fight, go with it, the word itself is perfect fine as it
is because it expressed your feeling at the moment well (effective),
message clearly understood (no lost-in-translation), and will have
the intended result (fight) &amp;mdash; man, if only projects at work can
be done as such!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So I think the trouble really begines when 
using it without anticipating (or secretly not wanting) 
the fight that may follow &amp;larr; so again, it's the idea of getting
the benefit without paying a price makes it a &lt;em&gt;bad&lt;/em&gt; word.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is a quite fascinating &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/Remembering-China-1935-1945-MVP-Exner/dp/0898231701"&gt;book&lt;/a&gt;. Actually I started to find
myself always fascinated by early first-person account of China. I
have this curiosity of what this country was like, and everytime I

actually bothers me because I think I am being biased against them,
that I have already drawn a conclusion and am therefore seeing

&lt;p&gt;"If the government allows me to travel, they will pay my expenses."&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I felt uneasy at the thought of a culture in which there is no motive
for thrift, and in which one may not make one's own decision to
travel. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So even in the time of such, she had an acute sense of disillusion of
utopia however well its golden cage may give its captives. But again,
I start to wonder whether it is just a matter of choice of life style,
like belief, is completly subjective and opinionated. &lt;/p&gt;</content><category term="thoughts"></category><category term="thoughts"></category></entry><entry><title>Reader digest life</title><link href="https://fengxia41103.github.io/myblog/reader%20digest%20life.html" rel="alternate"></link><published>2018-01-18T21:30:00-05:00</published><updated>2018-01-18T21:30:00-05:00</updated><author><name>Feng Xia</name></author><id>tag:fengxia41103.github.io,2018-01-18:/myblog/reader digest life.html</id><summary type="html">&lt;blockquote&gt;

of training passing by a platform as he described how progress of AI
will pass human advantages.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But anyway, I disliked tremendously when I first watched his annual
presentation, which strongly mimiced Steven Jobs and a grand
powerpoint. I was disgusted not by the form or the content, but how he
was giving credits to those successful business men sitting in honory
seats &amp;mdash; yes they have done a great job in their own right; no I
get it, it's a licking butt, giving face, and a fxxk banquet of an
elite club of millionaires.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That's not the what I want to talk about in this article. A
detour. What really bugs me is the thought of how I am acquiring
information and knowledge. On one hand I take pride of myself of being
independent thinker, cynical, even over-critical; on the other hand,
even with all the books I am reading, I wonder that with the unique
view that author is presenting and I'm deep into it at this moment,
how do I know which side of the coin I am looking at? If I think
people who rely on reader's digest for information is lazy and biased,
am I really that different? Isn't what I see and read also just a
version of a digest? Even worse, author of the reader digest often
than not is a better writer, better analyst, better domain expert,
than I am, so his/her view and summary of the book/article/whatever
should have a better quality, depth, accuracy, thus a higher density
of information, than what I could derive through my own effort. So in
this light, me as a person who always to advocate efficiency, is
actually taking a path of lower efficiency in acquiring information!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Many many times I felt sorry for those upper management who was
litening to my presentation. My view is that their channel of
information came from my PPT, which truly I feel is just a tunnel view
of the subject, even though I honestly wasn't having any intention of
manipulating their perception. But it is inevitable. The slides bear a
stamp of my perception, and is completly limited to my own way of
thinking and understanding &amp;mdash; and mine could be well off track
from what the &lt;em&gt;truth&lt;/em&gt; is. But then, with so many projects going on
and so many new technologies, buzz words, subordinates and daily
meetings, even by design for their role in work, they have been deprived of
having hands-on experience to obtain the level of details that I have.
Therefore, they have not choice but to play the &lt;em&gt;managerial pride&lt;/em&gt;
because that's the only way they could mask their lack of confidence
in front of someone who has done the work many times over and know a
whole lot of details. But this is pathetic, don't you think?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Anyway, from my previous argument, learning from PPT is also more
efficient than me studying everything by myself. To think of it, even
going to school is an experience of learning from someone's reader's
digest, isn't it?  Professor had more knowledge and experience with
the subject, s/he picked a book, taught us a few things about the
subject, and influenced with s/he own personal view of what topic in
this field holds a higher priority and excitement. Therefore, learning
from reader's digest is not an evil, nor an outlier, but a necessity,
a norm, a must.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But but, I still have a strong feeling against program like 罗辑思维
when it &lt;strong&gt;preached&lt;/strong&gt; the idea of "let me read, for you". This ideology
bothers me. I appreciate a venue to learn a summary of a book, even an
opinion (or opinions) through such a program. But it being an only,
or even an primary information channel, &lt;strong&gt;is not healthy&lt;/strong&gt; I would
say. Regardless how well the digest sounds, it is a distilled version,
and it is not &lt;strong&gt;your version&lt;/strong&gt;. There is nothing wrong to adopt it as
your version if you feel so, but always bear in mind that it is one
way to look at things, not The way. More importantly, &lt;strong&gt;it should
trigger a train of thought that disturbs you more than it gives you
anwsers &amp;mdash; it demonstrates how ignorant one is (how can I never
heard of this before!?), and how ignorant one is about one's
ignorance&lt;/strong&gt;!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I think reading, listening to these digests are fine and a must. But
don't stop there. If it is a topic that interest you dearly, dig in,
you will be shocked how deep all rabbit holes go. The evil of 罗辑思维
or any digest is when it prints in large font "all you need to know"
on package &amp;mdash; that is not a summarized knowledge anymore, that
has become a dose of opium numbing your soul.&lt;/p&gt;</content><category term="thoughts"></category><category term="thoughts"></category></entry><entry><title>Best yoda lines</title><link href="https://fengxia41103.github.io/myblog/best%20yoda%20line.html" rel="alternate"></link><published>2018-01-17T11:30:00-05:00</published><updated>2018-01-17T11:30:00-05:00</updated><author><name>Feng Xia</name></author><id>tag:fengxia41103.github.io,2018-01-17:/myblog/best yoda line.html</id><summary type="html">&lt;p&gt;Noah wrote a sheet he titled &lt;code&gt;best yoda line from the clone

&lt;h1&gt;Episode 2: fuss&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On the way driving back from a bookstore on a cold winter weekend (and
he was coughing and wheezing a bit over the weekend so something was
looming). So I proposed to stop by Lake Johnson for walk (and to kill
time), and his origami yoda said "No" (and we in the end lost the
origami yoda, which made him really upset ~~). &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Me: let's go to Lake Johnson
Noah: No, my origami yoda says No
Me: but but, I want to go Lake Johnson
Noah: (pause) fine, we can go Lake Johnson, because I don't want you
  fuss at me
Me: fuss at you? (first time heard him saying this word, &lt;code&gt;fuss&lt;/code&gt;)
Noah: yes
Me: what do you mean? (I found this really funny, and cute)
Noah: cause you will fuss at 我 if I don't go, and I don't want you
fuss at 我
Me: hahaha, 我怎么fuss at 你了?
Noah: (persona my voice) I don't want your help. The best help is when
  you take care of youself... 我是在学你,you said to我
Me: hahahaha... 
Noah: and I know you were angry, cause you say that when you are angry
Me: (this is just hilarious)
Noah: and it makes me feel like an idiot
Me: (oh, no, now I feel very sorry)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;Episode 3: love&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Driving to work in the morning, forgot what topic we were discussing,
I was conjuring up something &lt;em&gt;funny&lt;/em&gt;, but before I said it:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Noah: I don't want to hear
Me: what!? what do you not want to hear!?
Noah: I know you are thinking about something
Me: what!?
Noah: ok, say it
Me: ..... then just dispose you (I mean to tease him that I'll throw
  him out the car, I think)
Noah: what do you mean by &lt;em&gt;dispose me&lt;/em&gt;?
Me: kick you out of the care
Noah: mom is gonna kill you
Me: huh? what do you mean?
Noah: 妈妈会kill你 for kicking me out of the car
Me: why?
Noah: because she won't let me die
Me: wow, what do you mean?
Noah: cause she will not let me die in front of her
Me: why not?
Noah: (pause) because she loves me
Me: what about 爸爸? 爸爸也love你啊.
Noah: True (reluctantly). But sometimes you make fun of 我, and make
  me feel to punch you ...
Me: (&lt;em&gt;&amp;amp;#(&lt;/em&gt;^&lt;em&gt;&amp;amp;$#)(&amp;amp;$(&lt;/em&gt;#&amp;amp;($))))&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;Noah's yoda lines&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Fear is the path to the dark side&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Fear leads to anger&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;anger leads to Hate&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Hate leads to suffering&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The fea of loss is a path the dark side&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Death is a natural part of life&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Rejoice for those around you who transform into the force.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Mourn them, do not. Miss them do not.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Attachment leads to jealousy&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The shadow of greed that is&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Train yourself to let go of everything you fear to lose&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I think, well, actually not that I think, I feel, I feel it with me,
that I have grown very much impatient with Noah's mom now. This is
really sad. I think there is something up to her life recently, too
&amp;mdash; she was not being patient with Noah, actually I would say
&lt;em&gt;less patient&lt;/em&gt; with him than I do these days even. I don't know. It
could be just a period, but then, it's not like her.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Then, I got a phone call from our contractor asking about the vanity
doors. Honestly I haven't seen them much since they were removed, and
have little idea where they are. Yet, just from the conversation I
picked up from her this weekend, I had a faint idea of what happened
to it, and of course, a phone call verified the hunch.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This makes me wonder, why so? and does it matter at all? and why do I
get upset? First of all, the matter is such a minor case that it
doesn't lend itself to a reason …&lt;/p&gt;</summary><content type="html">&lt;figure class="col l6 m6 s12"&gt;

to it, and of course, a phone call verified the hunch.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This makes me wonder, why so? and does it matter at all? and why do I
get upset? First of all, the matter is such a minor case that it
doesn't lend itself to a reason to frustrate. Yes it is an
inconvenience; nah, it doesn't hurt things I deem important, the place
will come together, the contractor will be a bit upset (but then he is
always a bit upset, as a technique I believe), and the &lt;em&gt;harmony&lt;/em&gt; or
the feeling of peace of mind is certainly more important than a
missing vanity door, which is being disregarded anyway. So why do I
feel upset, at least at that moment?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I think what really upset me, is the thought that this is a case
proving my &lt;strong&gt;bias&lt;/strong&gt; that she has a terrible judgement. This is too
strong a word and statement, and I feel actually quite uncomfortable
with it as I don't even use them on people who really pissed me
off. Yet, that's how I feel, about her. I don't know how to describe
it, nor having a clear thoughts on what it means. It's a feeling, a
confession, an, even I would say a guilty expectation, that she will
make such a fall. &lt;strong&gt;This is not fair to her at all&lt;/strong&gt;! But why can't I
check myself when it comes to her case!? I feel I'm just chanting the
thought that "you are wrong you are wrong you are wrong..." until, as
sure as it must be eventually (as anything could possibly be, after
all, no one, nothing, is perfect anyway!), she will be wrong &amp;mdash;
isn't this the same that I always look at China's booming economy with
a pessimistic view, until someday it proves this case and I will be
like, "ah ha, I knew it!"&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But seriously, this is such a bad way to look at things! This is just,
dark! &lt;strong&gt;This makes me actively seek for faults in these negative views
so to prove the view itself, therefore it becomes a self-fulfilled
prophecy!&lt;/strong&gt; This is just, terrible, unfair. What kind of person am I?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But why!? is that because I have already determined her image
therefore seeking to prove it? or, taking the China economy as the
case, that fundamentally I feel left-out without being benefitted?
What if I were the lucky one who came out on top of the ride? Would I
still be as &lt;strong&gt;biased&lt;/strong&gt; and &lt;strong&gt;unfair&lt;/strong&gt; as I am today!? Isn't the view
that I'm holding against her really roots in the fact that I have lost
her on the way but I'm still viewing myself in a light of being worthy
having!? What happens if I adjust my own view so that she made the
right decision to leave, and I am not worth her time anymore!? But
then, who wants to admit that to oneself!? or to live with this view!?
Because I think this just leaves to elimination of self-confidence, which then
leads to depression, then to, what, death!? If you don't think of
yourself worth having, man, that just can't be good.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And also, why you want to think that way anyway!? You are not that
good, but not that bad either. Objectively speaking, you two are just
growing apart. Why being resentful, being unfair, being upset!? I
don't get upset much by any stranger having a terrible judgement, why
is it different on her case then? Doesn't it mean that I still view
her not as another stranger yet? or even worse, I view her as a
stranger that is worse than an average one, because I think I know she
could have done better?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Maybe that's why. Like the &lt;a href="https://fengxia41103.github.io/myblog/age and maturity.html"&gt;frustration logic&lt;/a&gt;, it's the false
feeling of control and expectation that leads me to this. But then,
the only alternative, if a peace of mind is the goal, is not caring
anymore. And with Noah and fluffies attached to this relationship, it
is an impossibility. So really people get upset about a mistake or an error
is that they extrapolate that onto something or someone they actually
do care about. If there is a distance between that mistake and the
caring target, it becomes pretty easy to visualize that the more
extrapolation one does, the more likely it will reach a point touch
those target, therefore leading to upset.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So with this, I can see that being upset of someone is indeed unfair!
You are the one doing the extrapolation. How far you care that logic
is completly up to you. The person who has done something, whether
good or bad, has no control, but the &lt;em&gt;perception&lt;/em&gt; of that act is being
depending on your degree of extrapolation now. So it is unfair to
blame at all; you already choose to blame and are only seeking
evidence to support your conclusion by extrapolation until that act
touches something you care. You could have also chosen to stop the
extrapolation short, as we often say "taking the matter as it is",
don't &lt;strong&gt;over-&lt;/strong&gt;extrapolating things.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But either way, if one takes a view of an action never in light of how
it is going to impact me or someone I care, then, there will be
nothing left to be cared about, and one becomes a cold-hearted,
souless, walking dead. That's a doom, too.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Man, this logic, is actually very depressing, indeed.&lt;/p&gt;</content><category term="thoughts"></category><category term="thoughts"></category></entry><entry><title>Age and maturity</title><link href="https://fengxia41103.github.io/myblog/age%20and%20maturity.html" rel="alternate"></link><published>2018-01-07T12:33:00-05:00</published><updated>2018-01-07T12:33:00-05:00</updated><author><name>Feng Xia</name></author><id>tag:fengxia41103.github.io,2018-01-07:/myblog/age and maturity.html</id><summary type="html">&lt;figure class="col l6 m6 s12"&gt;

&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I admire youth. It is a wonderful treasure to have since there is
nothing you did to have it, and nothing you can do to retain it. You
have it when you have it, then it's gone. But youth is also an awful
curse since you are cast into a spell of &lt;strong&gt;hope&lt;/strong&gt;, which is often
viewed as a bless, the last straw Gods put into the Pandora's box so
to save human from drowning from the evil of chance (but can also be
viewed as an evil. go figure.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It's admirable to quote classics and such so support a view you have
as if these classics add much credibility and value to your
opinion. Yet, I would have to argue that the same statement made by
these &lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eA7rKZbF_RI&amp;amp;index=1&amp;amp;list=PLATwx1z00HseXmeCbjbJRkaVO3088hC_A"&gt;老男人 on this show&lt;/a&gt; bears sophistication that the junior

cruel (and amusing) to watch the tease, but fundamentally I feel sad
that myself has reached the age to appreciate these remarks, and found
life and people to be such a messy business that they have lost all
the halo of glory &amp;mdash; it used to be that people are genuinely good
and occasionally bad. No. People are genuinely practical and
self-important, and accidentally considerate. That's just, that.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;Love, expectation&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I often look at Noah and wonder whether he is an odd case of growing
up in a slower pace than my expectation (or my unconscious reference
to other kids at this age whom I don't know much about but have drawn
an irresponsible conclusion that they behave &lt;em&gt;better&lt;/em&gt; or &lt;em&gt;on par&lt;/em&gt; to
what this age &lt;em&gt;should be&lt;/em&gt;. How ridiculous is this statement if I'm
looking at myself from a third-party view! So even as much as I'd like
to take pride of my reasoning and logical thoughts, I myself fall as
victim of being thoroughly irrational, unreasonable, and unfair, to
Noah's case at least. So what credit do I have to criticize or comment
on others!?). But the truth is, I was acting just like him when I was
at this age, and I know too well how he is enjoying being viewed as a
little kid spoiled by mom and being the center of attention. He
doesn't recognize this, but the feeling is too good to be passed
by. And yet, if he is to follow the path I have come along, I know
what pitfall he is to have, and how eventually he is to understand of
himself (as I think I do of him at this moment) what he is really
doing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After all, I believe nowadyas that everyone is living off an image
himself or herself is projecting &amp;mdash; thus the happiness of being
in love is really that you are in love with the projected self who is
a state of love, that you are being kind, being generous, being the
center of a person's universe, and being appreciated for whatever you
do as all intentions are being interpreted in a positive way. Of
course, then the projected image does not fade, but the diff between
this image and day-to-day actions will start to manifest, therefore
fostering disappointment and frustration.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;A theory on frustration&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Talking about frustration, I was thinking about this yesterday, and it
suddenly occurred to me, that the source of frustration isn't what you
expectation isn't satisfied. You could very well expect a thing with
your heart and soul, but it doesn't frustrate you a bit if you never
feel in a position of having the slightest control of the outcome!
Think about buying a lottery ticket, I don't think it's a frustrating
experience at all when you lose. The fact that you already know your
chance of winning is slim doesn't cancel your secret prayer of winning
at all. If we take one step further, &lt;strong&gt;frustration is really caused
when you think (I know, you think) you know how the situation can be
better but turn out not to be&lt;/strong&gt;! If you ever think you have put into
effort of winning that lottery thus having a level of control of it,
well, you will be frustrated.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So whenever I feel the frustration towards Noah, it is really rooted
in my belief that he could have done better, and he is in the position
to make the outcome better. But doesn't it mean that eliminating this
belief equals to giving it up &amp;mdash; that nothing he could have done,
so be it? This sounds not only discouraging, but impractical to
execute. One can't give up all level of control; otherwise, one would
have been paralyzed to walk in life since daily life consists of
millions of decisions one has to make, and the sheer mechanism of
making a decision consists of nothing but some sort of
confidence/judgement of being in control. Therefore, it is only
possible to assume that he is executing with a level of control
&amp;mdash; thus, I was right to feel frustrated (whenever he &lt;em&gt;forgot&lt;/em&gt; his
stuff in school, like on the 2nd day of a new semester, and out of the
pile of Lost &amp;amp; Found in Wiley at the end of 2017 winter semester, he
found two jackets, one sweater &amp;mdash; it was just sad sad sad!) Now I
guess the question becomes whether I should have assumed him having
the control over the things he is not performing well!? That I don't
know. It can be easily blanketed by the term of &lt;em&gt;expectation&lt;/em&gt;
&amp;mdash; no expectation, no frustration &amp;mdash; and yet, the only
possibility of no expectation is when you don't care about it anymore.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is a long iteration towards such a conclusion which have always
been obvious. Couples quarrel when they still care to resolve the
difference; indifference to each other is a death sentence to a
relationship. However, if this logic is sound, it means frustration is
a logical outcome of a relationship! This sounds terrible! Isn't that
any relationship is then inherently cursed? the cliché, of course, is
that the two need to learn to resolve this.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But this statement implies that frustration is bad, is a problem, is
hampering the health of love. What if we recognize frustration (and
same for other emotions, eg. anger, sadness, and so on) in a neutral
light that it is just part of human emotions, it exists so to express
a particular feeling, like a noun describing this is a cat and that is
a dog. There is nothing bad about it, just one emotion you develop in
a natural course, and need to learn to use in its context!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But what does this mean!? Is frustration then an emotional syntax when
I want to convey this feeling to the other person so she can
understand what my feeling is? It feels that way. But it also always
ties to a pointer of criticism that makes the other person
&lt;em&gt;hurt&lt;/em&gt;. Because we have said that frustration comes from assumption
that one can control the outcome better. Well, the &lt;strong&gt;one&lt;/strong&gt; is either
yourself, or the other person, isn't it!? If yourself is in the driver
seat, it's up to you to make it better (but it didn't), so you hate
yourself; in most cases, it's the other &lt;em&gt;one&lt;/em&gt; you feel could have done
better, thus this logically leads &lt;strong&gt;criticism&lt;/strong&gt;. There is a third
option, that the other &lt;em&gt;one&lt;/em&gt; is some God, and this is nothing but
saying "Nah, no one has really the control", thus leading to fatalism
I believe.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Therefore, the only non-frustrating relation one can have is that one
party is taken as completly &lt;strong&gt;incapable&lt;/strong&gt;! A pet, a toddler, or what
men used to view women in an inferior fashion (but this is just
wrong!).... hmmm, interesting.&lt;/p&gt;</content><category term="thoughts"></category><category term="thoughts"></category></entry><entry><title>Half the world</title><link href="https://fengxia41103.github.io/myblog/half%20the%20world.html" rel="alternate"></link><published>2018-01-01T18:30:00-05:00</published><updated>2018-01-01T18:30:00-05:00</updated><author><name>Feng Xia</name></author><id>tag:fengxia41103.github.io,2018-01-01:/myblog/half the world.html</id><summary type="html">&lt;figure class="col l6 m6 s12"&gt;

Japan, Korea and India in the year of 1911. What a view he had!?&lt;/p&gt;

more backwards than I have thought, have been taught to believe, and

therefore, the convention wisdom of the two terms are not nearly as
clear as one assumes. On the contrary, they are such a broad brush in
a social, historical, even geographical context that the line between
them are completly blurred and up for interpretation by whoever is
speaking!).  Not that the West was being more civilized, advanced,
enlightened, knowledgeable, but the East had grown to be primitive
(the &lt;a href="https://www.gutenberg.org/files/29546/29546-h/images/054b.jpg"&gt;Korean spade pic&lt;/a&gt;),
rigid (Indian's caste system!), and 
readily positioned itself to be swept away by the wave of
development. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The only way out of this is not to lock yourself into a belief but to
think yourself and to listen and to read as much as you can. Quoting
from the book,&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;we are also ready to admit the truth of what Dr. Timothy Richard
said to me in Peking last November. "This revolutionary progress in
China has come about," he remarked, "because for twenty years China
has been measuring herself with other countries. It is a comparative
view of the world that is remaking the empire."&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This echoes again my firm belief that &lt;strong&gt;open-mindness&lt;/strong&gt;, the sheer 
exposure of 
multiple angles of views of the same world we live in,
makes you think, makes you wonder, make you tremble, with excitement
and with fear, make you question what you have been told all along,
make you seek explanation none sofar has been satisfying to you, make
you put conflicting theories, ideologies, teachings, point of views,
voices, opinions, beliefs, interpretations, writings, sacred or not,
together into a single entity &amp;mdash; yourself &amp;mdash; with a struggle
to internalize all, bits from some, pieces from another, so to reach a
world you yourself can explain, can navigate, can function, can make
decisions as if there were a reason, can see the cause as if there were
one, can feel confident from time to time, can act as if its intended
outcome is predictable, can convince yourself what to and not to do,
can convince others what you think is right and wrong, and can hope
(if Hope was indeed a savior instead of an evil!) your existence make
sense. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So reading, thinking, debating, conflicting, is the only way that
knowledge (what an abstract term itself is! what is a knowledge!? how
do you know you have obtained &lt;em&gt;knowledge&lt;/em&gt;?) can be manifested.
Reconciliation is difficult; yet, everyone is a result of
reconciliation of all the above, or else s/he will not
exist. Contradiction is eternal; consistency is an illusion;
consistently contradicting is real.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"I cannot help thinking," said one of my friends to me when I left home, "that when you get over on the other side of the world, in Japan and China, you will have to walk upside down like the flies on the ceiling!"&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While I find that this is not true in a physical sense, it is true, as Mr. Percival Lowell has pointed out, that, with regard to the manners and customs of the people, everything is reversed, and the surest way to go right is to take pains to go dead wrong! "To speak backward, write backward, read backward, is but the A B C of Oriental contrariety."&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Alice need not have gone to Wonderland; she should have come to Japan.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I cannot get used, for example, to seeing men start at what with us would be the back of a book or paper and read toward the front; and it is said that no European or American ever gets used to the construction of a Japanese sentence, considered merely from the standpoint of thought-arrangement. I had noticed that the Japanese usually ended their sentences with an emphatic upward spurt before I learned that with them the subject of a sentence usually comes last (if at all), as for example, "By a rough road yesterday came John," instead of, "John came by a rough road yesterday."&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And this, of course, is but one illustration of thousands that might be given to justify my title, "The Land of Upside Down," the land of contradictions to all our Occidental ideas. That {4} Japan is a land "where the flowers have no odor and the birds no song" has passed into a proverb that is almost literally true; and similarly, the far-famed cherry blossoms bear no fruit. The typesetters I saw in the Kokumin Shimbum office were singing like birds, but the field-hands I saw at Komaba were as silent as church-worshippers. The women carry children on their backs and not in their arms. The girls dance with their hands, not with their feet, and alone, not with partners. An ox is worth more than a horse. The people bathe frequently, but in dirty water. The people are exceptionally artistic, yet the stone "lions" at Nikko Temple look as much like bulldogs as lions. A man's birthday is not celebrated, but the anniversary of his death is. The people are immeasurably polite, and yet often unendurably cocky and conceited. Kissing or waltzing, even for man and wife, would be improper in public, but the exposure of the human body excites no surprise. The national government is supposed to be modern, and yet only 2 per cent, of the people--the wealthiest--can vote. Famed for kindness though the people are, war correspondents declared the brutality of Japanese soldiers to the Chinese at Port Arthur such as "would damn the fairest nation on earth." Though the nation is equally noted for simplicity of living, it is a Japanese banker, coming to New York, who breaks even America's record for extravagance, by giving a banquet costing $40 a plate. The people are supposed to be singularly contented, and yet Socialism has had a rapid growth. The Emperor is regarded as sacred and almost infallible, and yet the Crown Prince is not a legitimate son. Although the government is one of the most autocratic on earth, it has nevertheless adopted many highly "paternalistic" schemes--government ownership of railways and telegraphs, for example. The people work all the time, but they refuse to work as strenuously as Americans. The temples attract thousands of people, but usually only in a spirit of frolic: in the first Shinto temple I visited the priests offered me sake (the national liquor) {5} to drink. Labor per day is amazingly cheap, but, in actual results, little cheaper than American labor.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It is amid such a maze of contradictions and surprises that one moves in Japan. When I go into a Japanese home, for example, it is a hundred times more important to take off my shoes than it is to take off my hat--even though, as happened this week when I called on a celebrated Japanese singer, there be holes in my left sock. (But I was comforted later when I learned that on President Taft's visit to a famous Tokyo teahouse his footwear was found to be in like plight.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Speaking of music, we run squarely against another oddity, in that native Japanese (as well as Chinese) music usually consists merely of monotonous twanging on one or two strings--so that I can now understand the old story of Li Hung Chang's musical experiences in America. His friends took him to hear grand opera singers, to listen to famous violinists, but these moved him not; the most gifted pianists failed equally to interest him. But one night the great Chinaman went early to a theatre, and all at once his face beamed with delight, and he turned to his friends in enthusiastic gratitude: "We have found it at last!" he exclaimed. "That is genuine music!" . . . And it was only the orchestra "tuning up" their instruments!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;BUDDHISM, SHINTOISM, AND CHRISTIANITY IN JAPAN&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;No religion of the Far East has ever recognized the dignity of woman, probably because no religion has ever recognized the worth of the individual. Just as I have said, that in the old days, and almost as largely to-day, in the relations of the home, it was the family that counted and not the individual, so in his relations to the larger world beyond the individual formerly counted for nothing when weighed against the wishes of the superior classes. In the earliest days, when the lord died, a number of his subjects were buried with him to wait upon his spirit in the Beyond. Later, with the same object in view, wives and servants committed suicide on the death of the master. Even now it is regarded as honorable for a girl to sell herself into shame to save the family from want.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The same antipodal difference between East and West--here "the family is the social unit" and with us the individual himself--explains the system of adoption: a younger son not being essential to the maintenance of the family cult may be adopted into another family, while the eldest son may not. On the same principle the father rules, not because of what he represents as an Individual, but because he represents the Family. Whenever he chooses, he abdicates, and must then join his other children in obeying the eldest son.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the relations of citizenship the same disregard of {56} individual rights was the ancient rule, not merely in the fact that for centuries the smallest details of everyday life were regulated by law, but more seriously in that the Samurai, or privileged class, might "cut down in cold blood a beggar, a merchant, or a farmer on the slightest provocation, or simply for the purpose of testing his sword," while in case of the ruin of their cause it was the honorable and natural thing for soldiers to commit "hari-kiri"--that is to say, commit suicide by disemboweling themselves. A Japanese writer recently declared that "the value of the individual life is an illustration of the Christian spirit" that is profoundly influencing Japan, and he mentioned as an example that formerly suicide, in such circumstances as I have mentioned, "was regarded as an honorable act; now it is regarded as a sin."&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Without professing the religion of fatalism which so influences the peoples of the Nearer East, the Japanese soldiers behave like fatalists because the fundamental basis of the social order for centuries has been the necessity of the Individual to sacrifice pleasure, comfort, or life itself when required either by the Family or by the Social Order. And this partially explains why it is said in sober earnest that the highest ambition of most Japanese schoolboys to-day is to die for their Emperor.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Got a book and it is truly disturbing, &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/Rape-Mind-Psychology-Menticide-Brainwashing/dp/1614277877"&gt;Rape of the Mind&lt;/a&gt;. So the
mind manipulation has been developed to the point that is highly
refined, highly &lt;code&gt;scientific&lt;/code&gt; (you know I always have reserve about
this particular word this days), highly systematic, and highly
predictable. And this is the really disturbing. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Like how I have analyzed my line of work, psychology has developed
framework and divided torture into phases that can be systematically
entered through means of physical torture, drug, mental confusion and
such. Therefore, all the brutality of torturing on the body isn't just
a pain to bear or to yield, but just one step towards a goal that the
initiator has a clear definition &amp;mdash; in other words, he knows what
he is doing, the question is, if you are the one being tortured, do
you know what he is doing to you!?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Scary, isn't it!? Part of the book will be talking about mind
manipulation on the mass, which I have always wondered about. The
recent movie 芳华 made the talk of that bizarre age to the headline
again, which is often a cliche to my education and my generation, when
everybody kinda of shrug shoulder as if it was a bad dream and would
not happen again. Yeah, it was just a crazy time done by crazy
people. But always, I ask myself, was it? Was it just made possible
because of the all the crazy people over excited about their
communist future, or it was a demonstration of evil manipulation of
the mass, as what this book is talking about? If you were caught in a
bad dream, how do you know!? or you just can't know? If so, what's the
remedy? I think bad dream happens, so you can't eliminate it. Then
what? You get caught and destroyed by it? or is there a way to ID the
dream even while you are in it, like that spinning totem in the
Inception movie?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I never knew the word &lt;code&gt;brain wash&lt;/code&gt; was invented by the Chinese
(according to the book author). Nonetheless, I firmly believe the act
and the thought of braining washing anyone, for however the purpose
and agenda, is evil. This come from my underline belief that if there
were one thing that is completly free in this world, it is the
mind, and to me, guarding its freedom is the last line of defense of
humanity. That's why I view the way internet is being blocked in China
as a pure act against humanity and society because it is artificially
controlling the input to your mind so to achieve a controllable output
&amp;mdash; this is setup of a social lab, and I don't want to be in it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But reading the western philosophy make this even worse. To some
views, the mind is not free, it doesn't even exist. We can be just in
the dream, and there is nothing wrong with that. Dream isn't an
illusion, and illusion isn't necessarily bad either. It's just, that.
Descarte's &lt;strong&gt;I think therefore I am&lt;/strong&gt; is neither sufficient nor
correct, because it implies a causal relationship which he didn't
want, so he changed it to &lt;strong&gt;I am, I exist&lt;/strong&gt;. How fascinating! I admire
these thinkers who made reasoning to explore these concepts. It
doesn't really matter which conclusion they have, I think the act of
thinking and reasoning is the cornerstone of humanity and being.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Sitting here watching Noah finally got to play his minecraft game, I
wonder, even it's a fantasy world he is building and is into at the
moment, he is creating (a fuzzy pixel house), a world of his own, 
that reflects what his mind has, his reasoning carries, and his like
prefers... however unreal this world is, it's a place he can feel, how
it is like being free. &lt;/p&gt;</content><category term="thoughts"></category><category term="thoughts"></category></entry><entry><title>Logic</title><link href="https://fengxia41103.github.io/myblog/logic.html" rel="alternate"></link><published>2017-12-19T08:50:00-05:00</published><updated>2017-12-19T08:50:00-05:00</updated><author><name>Feng Xia</name></author><id>tag:fengxia41103.github.io,2017-12-19:/myblog/logic.html</id><summary type="html">&lt;figure class="col l5 m5 s12"&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It amazes me, really, that how many people are conflicting themselves
in term of logic in their arguments. Or I should say, everyone,
including myself, are constantly in a state of contradicting of
ourselves when it comes to explain an opinion or in a discussion to
win a debate. How so?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So the big news of China's financial world is that Baidu is opening up
some kind of online version of a traditional bank, and everybody
thinks it is going to rock the money industry because now it has
officially married the crown jewel of this era &amp;mdash; computer
technology. Of course, the marriage carries an army of buzz word
ornaments &amp;mdash; AI, big data... the scenario is that by collecting
consumer data and data crunching, agent shall be able to &lt;strong&gt;improve
efficiency&lt;/strong&gt; dramatically in deciding whether one should get a loan
approval or not, which, if realized as what they say, is certainly a
huge advantage over the status quo &amp;mdash; Chinese state-owned banks
are notorious in treating their customers badly by being low efficient

approval or not, which, if realized as what they say, is certainly a
huge advantage over the status quo &amp;mdash; Chinese state-owned banks
are notorious in treating their customers badly by being low efficient
and arrogant. From my own experience, both as an employee and as a
customer, the understanding of what data is and what one can do with
it is just not there. Yes they collect a huge amount of private data,
but at the mean time these data are dis-organized, arbitrarily
designed and decided &amp;mdash; guilty as charged, I was one of those who
actually designed application form that our loan customer has to fill
out for dollar amount up to millions (!!), while I had literally zero
experimental proof of any of those data points could be effective, or
even correlate in one way or another!? Even worse, the VP of the bank
had strong opinion of his own so the form also incorporated many of
his &lt;em&gt;wishes&lt;/em&gt; while his only defense is that &lt;em&gt;it has been used in
banking industry for years&lt;/em&gt; or that &lt;em&gt;he had good experience with it&lt;/em&gt;
&amp;mdash; all subjective, all &lt;em&gt;what I say against yours, and I win
because I'm the boss&lt;/em&gt;, kind of deal &amp;rarr; so that's how the wheels
went. I'm super-surprised how well these banks are doing according to
their official paper, while its internal is such a mess. Oh well.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Back to the topic. Universally everybody thought Baidu stepping into
the financial world is a big news, even as yet another example that
these tech companies &amp;mdash; Alibaba, Tencent, are transforming
themselves into something closer to money. Why? Because the core of
the argument is that by looking at the same type of entity in the US
market, who has about 10% of all financial transaction volume, China
has only 0.2% currently &amp;rarr; therefore, we are looking at 50x growth
just to &lt;em&gt;catch up&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;But wait!!! This is what bothers me now&lt;/strong&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;You can't have both True&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;First of all, where is the voice of familiar &lt;em&gt;Chinese charateristics&lt;/em&gt;
now!? Don't people always think that their market is so unique (from
the rest of world) that it expects, deserves, a special treatment, a
Chinese version!?  How come all of sudden what US market is now a
benchmark? This isn't an isolated case. Taking any marketing PPT when
the first couple pages talks about an industry, a business model,
there is always the logic that whatever the 先进国家 has (or had), it
represents a self-proven projection of what the topic (and PPT
author's view) will have. Don't you see!? This is completly
contradicting to what they will &lt;strong&gt;inevitably&lt;/strong&gt; derive just a few pages
later, now the old cliché that "oh btw, China is different that you
just don't understand it as well as I do, and there is a new,
modified, custom-made version, just for China, and look how smart I
am, how business savvy I am, and how接地气 I am". Give me a fxxx
break!!! This is completly BS, and the frustration I have is that
s/he doesn't realize how BS s/he is being!  What I'm hearing are two
assumptions as the basis of their logic:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;I have an apple, and you have an orange.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Because orange grows 10 lb/piece, my apple will grow to 10 lb/piece, too.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Excuse me!? You can have one of these two points, but not both.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;You can't make projection withiout distinction&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Secondly, if the business (model) are indeed the same in core &amp;mdash;
online or not is just a form, the core of banking, the logic of
banking &amp;mdash; I'm talking about transactional logics and details, do
your due dilligence &amp;mdash; they should still be viewed in at least
two segments &amp;mdash; &lt;strong&gt;a fixed-value segment and a variable-value
segment&lt;/strong&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Fixed-value segment&lt;/strong&gt;: covers attributes and transactions that
are universally true and can be confidently applied in parallel, for
example, how interest rate is calculated, how accounting books are
made, how tax is done... really, people, please stop being creative in
this segment, read the rules written by authority and educate yourself
to be a domain expert on these. These are blank &amp;amp; white, and should be
understood like &lt;code&gt;2*2=4&lt;/code&gt; &amp;mdash; everybody works on the same syntax and
rule.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Variable-value segment&lt;/strong&gt;: covers these local opinions and customs
   that are society driven, psychology driven, and human-need
   driven. So the homework here is to gain an insight of these
   factors, and without me even says, these topics are &lt;strong&gt;hard&lt;/strong&gt;!!
   I wouldn't even dare to claim there is science behind them. There
   are studies and professors, but really, human business is just
   messy. It's difficult to profile a person, let alone to predict a
   behavior. There are patterns when samples are large, but individual
   is a wildcard.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So what I'm trying to derive from this? is that only the fixed values
are transportable and can be used in a projection. The variable
segment requires a delibrate analysis with a &lt;strong&gt;clearly defined point
of view&lt;/strong&gt; (yes, you are required to take a stand so all the analysis
has a foundation. Otherwise, it's meaningless.) and framework so to
support your opinion, and like any subjevtive POV it's very much up
for debate and challenge (but at least it is clear to all that it is a
subjective POV, not an objective fact, and that is a core
difference). But omitting it as if it is a universal knowledge without
a need of explanation is just a coward action showing that you don't
understand it either, and that defeats the whole logic of the my apple
will grow to 10 lb/piece just because their apple grows to that big,
too. &lt;strong&gt;No!!&lt;/strong&gt; If your division of fixed vs. variable is 20%-80%, I
would only accept that there is 20% of a chance your apple will grow
to their size, certainly not 100%. Period. You see, this is how logic
should be, be logical, and be consistent.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;Sigh&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Too many times now, in too many occasions, and by too many dressed-up
experts and talk shows, the two contradicting views are being
presented and mingled to support a single argument, which
fundamentally is saying:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"Look, I flip a coin and both faces are up!"&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This line is indeed impressive (as its speaker is hoping to sound). As
a matter of fact, it must be impressive, it has to be impressive,
because this is absolutely magical! It is absolutely magical because,
it can not logically happen. That's all.&lt;/p&gt;</content><category term="thoughts"></category><category term="thoughts"></category></entry><entry><title>Hurt feelings</title><link href="https://fengxia41103.github.io/myblog/hurt%20feelings.html" rel="alternate"></link><published>2017-12-11T21:30:00-05:00</published><updated>2017-12-11T21:30:00-05:00</updated><author><name>Feng Xia</name></author><id>tag:fengxia41103.github.io,2017-12-11:/myblog/hurt feelings.html</id><summary type="html">&lt;figure class="col s12"&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is a tough one, really, cause I have been puzzled by this topic
for the last five years, and am continuing being puzzled by it without
a resolution. I don't know how to resolve this. But it is definitely
an &lt;strong&gt;issue&lt;/strong&gt; of me that I need to understand, to fix (if it can be),
and to do better without this.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here is the situation: someone close to you said she was hurt, by you,
maybe a remark, a move, something. And here is the dilemma. On the one
hand, I think no one can control how another person feels, therefore
it is simply not sensible to project the result of the perception
&amp;mdash; you may make the perfect conversation with a golden heart,
there is simply nothing stop it being perceived as a vicious attack
with a dark intention. So, does this make it completly unrelated
between your behavior and others' reactions? In other words, if each
is responsible for his/her own feelings, do I just get a jail-free
card to be a jerk …&lt;/p&gt;</summary><content type="html">&lt;figure class="col s12"&gt;

is responsible for his/her own feelings, do I just get a jail-free
card to be a jerk? Certainly, it should not be this way.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But on the other hand, one can't be responsible for others, at least
not as adults. I mean, really, only you can make yourself happy, or
sad, or whatever, no one else can. If not, it becomes a scary thing,
because think of all the &lt;strong&gt;brain wash&lt;/strong&gt; remarks I have heard in my
education, in my experience working with Chinese elites, when all they
were crafting was to &lt;strong&gt;lead the customer&lt;/strong&gt; &amp;larr; isn't the underline
message of this is that fxxx you, I am &lt;strong&gt;telling &lt;/strong&gt; you what is good
or bad because first of all, you don't know, secondly, I am superior
to you!? This is just, so, wrong!!! But if you speak with a projection
of how the other person is to perceive and to react, doesn't it make
your saying a form of this manipulation? What is the difference? Yes
one can argue that one is with a good intention, and one is
deliberately manipulative. But well, how do you define "good"? Isn't
itself a subjective matter that what is good from your point of view
is, again, a poison for me, because I perceive that way!? Dont you
see, this argument becomes circular.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So what is a right thing to do, to say, to behave, to act, so you
don't hurt others? and should you care, if it is out of your control,
and as being good intention as you want, shouldn't you also avoid
&lt;strong&gt;manipulating&lt;/strong&gt; others' perception, even if it is positive (and
helpful)? Well, if you can make a positive impact, wouldn't it by
definition also make you in position to make bad and negative ones,
intentionally and unintentionally!?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I don't know. I feel this logic goes round and round without an
ending, and sometimes I feel I'm paralyzed by it. I feel the sensible
thing, if at all, is to be honest to yourself and to the othe person,
be sincere at the moment of your do and say, speak from your inner
belief, and live on. If others find you positive, great; if negative,
they are not for you and you are not for them. I think this is the
only possible outcome, that people love you, love you; people don't,
don't.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I have always argued that love is not given by the other person. It is
a creation of yourself &amp;mdash; you make yourself feel the love. When
you are in love, any "flaw" becomes a virtue, any cumbersome becomes a
thrill and cuteness; when love is gone &amp;mdash; I don't believe person changes
much, if at all, at least the primary attributes simply don't change
(even if you really want them to, you will be suprised how stubborn
they are) &amp;mdash; it's not the person who has gone bad, it's you who
have changed point of view, the same traits that used to be wonderful
and cute, now is ugly or intolerable.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So along this line, I think at the end of day, you can't be
responsible for others' feeling, you are in control of your own,
whether it is love or anything else. You can hurt others, even if you
are sincere and truthful, because perception is something you don't
have control, and should not try to control. In my opinion,
controlling is a far worse version than hurting someone on purpose
&amp;rarr; the former is lying, the latter is a claimed war so at least
you know what you are dealing with.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I don't know. I feel that I'm promoting open confrontation over
articulated social behavior. I'm not. I am just preferring
truthfulness over any form of disguise, however pretty and beautiful
it may seems for the time being. But then, I was told (by urban
legend), that woman always prefers the disguised version even she
knows it is not true. Huh?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I'm puzzled, and continue being so.&lt;/p&gt;</content><category term="thoughts"></category><category term="thoughts"></category></entry><entry><title>Love, life</title><link href="https://fengxia41103.github.io/myblog/love%20life.html" rel="alternate"></link><published>2017-12-01T11:30:00-05:00</published><updated>2017-12-01T11:30:00-05:00</updated><author><name>Feng Xia</name></author><id>tag:fengxia41103.github.io,2017-12-01:/myblog/love life.html</id><summary type="html">&lt;figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I'm in the middle of this mid-life crisis, I guess, which prompted me
to think a lot about why I am feeling this, whether this is happening
for a reason, that it is just unique to me, or to everyone in a way,
just different content? If it's the latter, then it's just like a
phase in growing up, that sooner or later one will experience it
&amp;rarr; it's the process driven by nature, not by my mind, which I
always fear is going crazy, sometimes. I mean, being unique is what
everybody wants, but being unique is also what gives you anxiety
&amp;mdash; you want to be part of a social team (so you don't feel left
out), but you also want to be standing out, uniquely you, being taken
that way, that you are someone &lt;strong&gt;special&lt;/strong&gt;. How conflicting! This is
like everything else in life, that two sides of a coin are fighting
but must co-exist, all the time, and inside one body, one brain, one
person! I used to think oxymoron is an exceptional …&lt;/p&gt;</summary><content type="html">&lt;figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I'm in the middle of this mid-life crisis, I guess, which prompted me

&amp;mdash; you want to be part of a social team (so you don't feel left

like everything else in life, that two sides of a coin are fighting
but must co-exist, all the time, and inside one body, one brain, one
person! I used to think oxymoron is an exceptional mind game or word
game that's fun to play with, as a joke.  But nowadays, I think it is
not even funny; it is the normal. Scary.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So, I was thinking about love, why two ppl fall in love with each
other, why the feeling of love can fade, say, in marriage, and too
often than we want it to, it not only fades, but flips to become an
agony, an annoyance, a piece of you that upsets you, makes you mad,
frustrated, even hatred. This can't be just a myth, a cliche that
marriage is the doom of love, then everybody, young and old repeat
generation after generation, partially driven by the mating urge, but
in many many many ways by a reflection of so called &lt;strong&gt;ideal self &amp;amp;
life&lt;/strong&gt; you have in mind. When young I used to think breaking up was
due to a misunderstanding of your partner, "can't you see how much I
love you!? can't you see how good I am!? can't you see what you are
missing out (by not being with me)!?...." If one ever take a step back
to look at these comments, the only conclusion to draw is, man, this
is one &lt;strong&gt;self-centered&lt;/strong&gt; man/woman! and who wants to be around someone
like that!? I think they did the right thing by leaving me. Really, I
would have made the same decision, because the person who thought that
way is just not lovable, at all.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But then, I start to ask, why I had thought that way? Was that because
of the age, that all young people are self-centered (and of course,
the younger you are, the more it is, just think of Noah, who was SUPER
self-centered when he was like 3-month, to like a 3-4 year. Man, he
couldn't care less of what the world is doing. He wanted his milk
bottle, now! So it is a phase thing!? so can one &lt;em&gt;grow out of it&lt;/em&gt;?
When? in his 80s? or 40s, like what I'm going through as I'm typing
these?), or it was happening for a reason? I mean, why one feels
self-important that way!? I think there is much &lt;strong&gt;self-confidence&lt;/strong&gt;
involved, that one truly think s/he is lovable, priceless, has much to
give to the other party, and has the strength to bring an image of
life and self in reality. Sometimes when I sit by Starbucks watching
young people coming in and out, I can't help feeling that besides the
nature's calls, there is a fundamental logic that one likes (and
likely to fall in love with) these beautiful young people, and here is
how it goes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;phase 1&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;figure&gt;
  &lt;img class="col s12"
       src="images/love%20life%20phase%201.png"&gt;
  &lt;figcaption&gt;Love life, phase 1&lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When you are young, how can you not be &lt;strong&gt;lovable&lt;/strong&gt;!? Just look at the
life around you. Yourself is healthy, having an endless
potential. Your parents are young enough and likely to contribute to
your life rathe than being a responsibility. You have an army friends
who share a very similar life (&amp;amp; styles) like you. You all have
similar worries and happinesses. You have quite a few suitors who
adore you, so you feel loved, needed, special (even though you may not
like them back).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is a version of life's image everyone would like to have, isn't
it!? The only drawback one says about this is that young people may be
poor. But, if you are not in the poor category, then life is
literally, wonderful!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So how can I not love someone like you!? You have everything to be loved!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;phase 2&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Then, there is phase 2. A bit older now, maybe married, maybe dating,
5-10 years into a career of some sort, have formed a few &lt;strong&gt;deeper&lt;/strong&gt;
understanding of the job, of boss and co-worker, of people and life in
general, hurt a few times by someone, hopefully not fatal and mentally
fatal, have moments of doubts and downs ofteners than before.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The killer problem starts to show &amp;mdash; if married, there maybe a
kid, oh man, parenting is just, HARD! or a few marriage/dating
glitches now and then, not quite sure the one you love or the life is
coming up, parents are aging and you start to see some effect of it,
grandparents are aging, too. And the worst thing is, friends start to
drive in different pace now, some getting ahead, some lingering (as
you always feel you are the one), some falling behind (but you feel
you are not that much better than them), some already has kid in 3rd
grade, while others are dating to get married, and you are just
somewhere in between, of all these.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The down spiral, sigh.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;figure&gt;
  &lt;img class="col s12"
       src="images/love%20life%20phase%202.png"&gt;
  &lt;figcaption&gt;Love life, phase 1&lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;h1&gt;sad, sad, sad&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I think you get the idea. Life is becoming more and more of things you
need to take care of &amp;mdash; parent, grandparent, kids, job, partner,
frustration of yourself, of seeing some of your friends/peers are
getting ahead, a few &lt;em&gt;what-ifs&lt;/em&gt; one start to ponder, an urge to find a
shortcut so to get back the &lt;em&gt;loss&lt;/em&gt;, and on and on and on.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is sad. And if you think of it and ask yourself, would you love
someone like this? If you are being with this person, your sphere of
problems and responsbilities have just expanded. So for a love between
adults, it is a serious &lt;strong&gt;commitment&lt;/strong&gt; to take on these, to make
his/her problem, mine. Let's face it, the reality is, these challenges
don't go away when you say "I love you".  They persist, until you find
a way to handle it &amp;rarr; this is the same that saying those buzz
words are easy and fun and blood-pumping, making a version of that
buzz word reality, however minute and preliminary that version is, is
hard.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;thoughts&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So, I'm not crazy after all. The feeling of struggle is not only real,
but logical. The task to tackle these things in life just can't be an
easy decision. It's only rational to feel the gravity of it and be
fearful of how much work it is going to take.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Those who think these are easy, just like the ones I always criticize
on those Chinese tech shows, or someone how
think &lt;a href="https://fengxia41103.github.io/myblog/mature tech.html"&gt;technology is mature&lt;/a&gt;, the truth is, they &lt;strong&gt;want someone
else to solve these for him/her&lt;/strong&gt;, because they certainly won't.&lt;/p&gt;</content><category term="thoughts"></category><category term="thoughts"></category></entry><entry><title>A vain debate pattern</title><link href="https://fengxia41103.github.io/myblog/a%20vain%20debate%20pattern.html" rel="alternate"></link><published>2017-11-14T12:30:00-05:00</published><updated>2017-11-14T12:30:00-05:00</updated><author><name>Feng Xia</name></author><id>tag:fengxia41103.github.io,2017-11-14:/myblog/a vain debate pattern.html</id><summary type="html">&lt;figure class="col l6 m6 s12"&gt;

the &lt;em&gt;next wave&lt;/em&gt; in technology, and automobile has long been seen as
the symbol of the start of America's industrial dominance &amp;mdash; the
high gear version of a terrible system called capitalism. So we could
lead the march to a new form of automobile, wow, that's like another
God's sign posted on the side of the road says, "yes you are the one,
you are made to replace America as #1. Look, you are replicating his
success! so that must be on the right path."&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Geee!!! Come on people! When you are so hung up on the idea that
critical path to success in electric car is battery technology, and
throwing in a few lines that government should step in to build
infrastructure so there is charging station available for drivers'
convenience, it pisses me off in a number degrees beyond frustration.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;battery's power is not, free&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;First of all, yes battery is the critical path. But no, let's take one
step further on this &amp;rarr; the key issue here is &lt;strong&gt;not about battery
vs. gasoline&lt;/strong&gt;, it is &lt;strong&gt;electricity vs. gasoline&lt;/strong&gt;. In other words,
it is really a comparison of two super duper complicated industries:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;power station + transmission + battery + engine&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;oil + transmission + combustion + engine&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So to comprehend the benefit (or con) of either side, one needs to
consider the whole nine yard of electricity generation from coal,
hydraulic power, wind, solar, nuclear, to a heated water pump that
drives a GIANT engine in an power plant, all the way to that little
tiny bit locked inside your battery, versus a &lt;strong&gt;completly similiar&lt;/strong&gt;
breakdown of technology chain but using, transporting a different
material. If you ever study high school physics, energy is constant,
just different form.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;People are talking about the power stored in battery as if it came for
free!! Nuts! The electrical power came from somewhere, and there is a
cost associate with it, and I'm not talking about the cost of $0.50
per watt you pay on your electricity bill, I'm talking about this
industrial supply chain that convert a raw material to a form that
will drive the wheels. So really, regardless which material to choose
from, it's the &lt;strong&gt;efficiency of this chain&lt;/strong&gt; matters, not the last link
of battery!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In other words, if you suck in the current chain (which, as matter
of fact, is a lot mature than the one you are proposing), then your
odds of doing well in the new chain is pretty slim, too.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Even to the extent of these people's favourate argument to support
electric car &amp;mdash; green. Well, the true comparison has to be an
aggregation of power station pollution versus. oil refinery pollution,
for the least. And you know what, don't we all agree that both are
nasty, equally evil, industry, that no one wants to have it in his
backyard!? If so, how can you just throw in a buzz word (again, I hate
people using &lt;a href="https://fengxia41103.github.io/myblog/sharing economy.html"&gt;buzz word&lt;/a&gt; like this!) and think all the old problems
would now go away!? No, they will not go away, unless you address them
diligently and &lt;strong&gt;efficiently&lt;/strong&gt;. Otherwise, I can bet that you are just
swapping one set of problems with another, just that the other set you
don't know much about yet &amp;larr; this is truly an example of &lt;strong&gt;the
happiness of the ignorance&lt;/strong&gt;!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;Same gravity&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Second, can you just drop the fantasy of the 中国玩法!? This is
absolutely a conspiracy theory now that just because the US and Europe
lead the technology race (as of today), so anything business model or
standard or theory must be inherently bad for China, so and so that
China has to control its own destiny by leveraging their lust for its
market to come up a new game rule!? Does it make you feel safe now!?
Really, I can understand in many levels why a country wants to do
that, but one should also admit there are fundamental principles that
apply to all human, all societies. I seriously wonder that rolling
back a few hundred years should China also acclaim that its gravity is
&lt;em&gt;very different&lt;/em&gt; from &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gravity_of_Earth"&gt;9.8&lt;/a&gt; thus Newton's laws just don't apply!?
Get a grip! There is a reason why western is leading the technology
race &amp;mdash; it had a first mover advantage, of course, but truly it's
the attitude of being practical, being critical, and less BS that give
them the advantage. Especially when we face the question of
efficiency, science, technology, really, there is one set of physics
rules that are universally true, and one should continue to challenge
it, to test it, to gain better understanding of it so to find out when
it falls short. But having a moral cry with excitement that "look, the
new Chinese way!", is just fxxxx BS.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;Be conservative&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I have observed this pattern many times over that is crazily prevalent
in China and its elite circle these days. I call it the &lt;strong&gt;view of
being a competitor rather than being a contributor&lt;/strong&gt;. China elites
keep thinking in term of a race and competition in which winner takes
it all. They should instead think how their experiments and trials
could help to eliminate unknown path and to contribute to the pool of
this overall interesting, seemingly beneficial, and humanely
progressive topic. If they truly believe in the future of a wide
adoption of this technology that can make people's life better, they
should be extremely critical of its risk and problems, because if you
truly care about people, you don't see shinning $$ signs or benefits
written all over, you see how painful and struggling someone's life
can be affected, and how agonizing that will be to one's soul, to
yours.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;Leave government alone&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Last, the baby cry that government should step in to do this, do
that. I think any idea is going to fly if the government steps in to
build an infrastructure for you, to eliminate tax, to ban all your
competitors, and so on.... this is baby talk! Chinese business people
are not entrepreneurs at all, they want government backup for
EVERYTHING! Who doesn't like a risk free business!? I know I will. But
then, don't label yourself pioneer, or business man, or
innovator... you are not! You are not even a follower. You just want
both, 当了婊子还要立牌坊, disgusting! Put those charging stations as a
sunk cost on your budget sheet, if you have one, factor in tax
benefits and potential loss, hone in your development and production
to make quality, efficient product, fight your competitors till one is
dead, and accept a lost battle with grace and regrets that there were
many many points you could have done better, differently, that may
have changed the outcome. Then, if given a chance, try again, if
that's still your passion to do. But mixing your grand, wonderful
business plan with a line saying government should have prepared the
stage for me... well, then I already know you will point a finger to
the government also when it doesn't work. It's just convenient, and
honestly, you didn't believe this so called &lt;em&gt;great stuff&lt;/em&gt; yourself
either, you just want to profit off others' belief. Shame.&lt;/p&gt;</content><category term="thoughts"></category><category term="thoughts"></category></entry><entry><title>A mature technology</title><link href="https://fengxia41103.github.io/myblog/mature%20tech.html" rel="alternate"></link><published>2017-11-08T14:30:00-05:00</published><updated>2017-11-08T14:30:00-05:00</updated><author><name>Feng Xia</name></author><id>tag:fengxia41103.github.io,2017-11-08:/myblog/mature tech.html</id><summary type="html">&lt;figure class="col s12"&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Really, whenever ppl use such a &lt;strong&gt;vain, vague, meaningless&lt;/strong&gt;
line as to set the theme of a  discussion, 
it is nothing but a grand title that leads
to nowhere and a unmistakened signal of wasting time on everybody 
involved on the thread, regardless the topic
and actual fact. Truth told, the speaker or the writer just has
zero clue of what the technology really means, how it works,
how it is implemented, what quirks s/he has experienced and is aware
of, how these quirks are going to impact what you are thinking to
achieve with this technology... the list can go on and on and on.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The bottom line is, there isn't such a thing as &lt;em&gt;mature
technology&lt;/em&gt;. There is known implementation of it; there is successful
case (and failure cases in that matter) of it; there is probably many
many theories and diagrams about it developed from multiple dimensions
of viewing angle so to have an &lt;em&gt;interpretation&lt;/em&gt; of it; there is so
called &lt;em&gt;best practice&lt;/em&gt; (even this term has been completly &lt;strong&gt;abused&lt;/strong&gt;
in context of a technical discussion) of certain aspects of it derived from accrued
experience by others who have treaded on this path before and
attempted a few things here and there while one is easier/harder than
another.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But the way people (bogus tech experts) commonly put this line forward, is really
&lt;strong&gt;implying one huge assumption&lt;/strong&gt; that this worked before, and I can
find someone to replicate this result.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Really!? Should we then list some counter example just to make a
point? Computer architecture. Since its birth, its architecture has
always been: a compute unit (CPU), memory (for transitional data),
storage (for data persistence), and data bus (for data
transportation). Every single electronic device that we know of today
follows this exact architecture (in its most general term). Yes it is
a mature design and widely adopted, understood, practiced, and
used. Yet, Intel can do it doesn't mean you can do it. If someone
standing on a stage and starts saying "this is a mature technology,
and I'm going build a computer of XYZ to make it the fastest or the
most powerful of computer on earth", forget it &amp;larr; no, it is a
mature design, probably, but there are million dials to make it work,
and having a architecture diagram at hand shows nothing of its
possible implementation path and its pitfall. If you are the first
time doing it, you will fail, 100% of the time. Like everything else
in life, if you never practiced it before, your odds of striking gold
on the first try is, and should be, &lt;strong&gt;zero&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So please, don't quote examples of Google whenever you talk about AI
or the best technology company; don't quote Amazon whenever the topic
is about e-commerce or supply chain; don't quote Alibaba or Tencent
whenever it's about Chinese tech ruling the world... because, like a
personal success story, the true capability of the company or the
business contribute to less than 10% of what it achieved. It's the
other 90% that has no theory, no diagram, no roadmap, no recipe, and
impossible to replicate. Period. Besides, duplicating the exact growth
path doesn't guarantee a 1-to-1 copy of their status to you,
either.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Not to mention, technology, is really a particular mindset, a view of
the world and a understanding of the issue, yours against mine. The
difference is not in which tech stack to use. It's in the way we each
build a logic, to do analysis, evaluation, and to battle trench wars
of the old saying of &lt;strong&gt;devils being in the details&lt;/strong&gt;,
and to make decisions along the trial-and-error.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you have done it yourself, speak with detail and concrete,
especially, with fear and concern, with identification of risks
and warning signs. If you don't know yourself but knowing somebody
whom you think can create this thing, let him/her speak. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Just remember, the phrase &lt;em&gt;mature technology&lt;/em&gt; is the first step
in the wrong direction.&lt;/p&gt;</content><category term="thoughts"></category><category term="thoughts"></category></entry><entry><title>History</title><link href="https://fengxia41103.github.io/myblog/history.html" rel="alternate"></link><published>2017-11-03T11:12:00-04:00</published><updated>2017-11-03T11:12:00-04:00</updated><author><name>Feng Xia</name></author><id>tag:fengxia41103.github.io,2017-11-03:/myblog/history.html</id><summary type="html">&lt;figure class="col l6 m8 s12"&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Reading &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/Rape-Nile-Robbers-Tourists-Archaeologists/dp/0813340616"&gt;The rape of the Nile&lt;/a&gt;, quite a fascinating book.

been around for much longer than that.&lt;/p&gt;

treating these ancient artifacts back then &amp;mdash; just like the
horror propaganda I have been told about China's treasure being looted
and trashed by barbarians of both foreign and domestic origin (and
admittedly much more by the domestic ones), the same theme of sadness
was playing in Egypt, over and over and over again. Pyramids were used
for quarrying building materials, and artifacts were given as a token
to influential whoever the ruler was trying to please. At the end of

&lt;p&gt;What really bothers me, however, is how the people at those days were

horror propaganda I have been told about China's treasure being looted

value. They were free gifts left over by ancient anonymous &amp;mdash;
cheap as dirt, and only meaningful to one when it could bring glory,
fame, profit, or the things s/he wants at that given moment. There was
no perpetual value, no inherited value, certainly no emotional value
worth preservation, and much less of responsible value by making them
available for the generations to come &amp;rarr; consume and dispose them
now, by me, period.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;"unfairness", in a hindsight&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But then, if you feel it is clear now to see how terrible those deeds
were, I kept wondering how to justify this view when I'm really
reading all these from a distant &lt;strong&gt;present&lt;/strong&gt;, or to say looking from a
rear view mirror. I hold a different prospective than those in the
book at the time. You can call it a progress of civilization as we are
now understanding more of its history (since no one was even able to
read the Egyptian words till the &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rosetta_Stone"&gt;Rosetta stone&lt;/a&gt;, and even that
took a few decades before it was deciphered), thus its importance and
value. But does it state that it's not fair to those people we call
&lt;em&gt;barbarians&lt;/em&gt; these days since they were really operating in a
disadvantage comparing to what we know today? Well, then why being
&lt;em&gt;fair&lt;/em&gt; is a measure of good or bad anyway? who said it must be &lt;em&gt;fair&lt;/em&gt;?
If you throw these out, then how does one look at so called
&lt;strong&gt;history&lt;/strong&gt; and opinionate it one way or the other? After all, each
holds his own life experience as the only foundation he could relate
and refer to. So it becomes a completly random chance that someone's
reference happens to match the one that later gets realized 
and is labelled as a &lt;strong&gt;human progress&lt;/strong&gt;, which then leads them
standing out as the pioneer and a great mind, while in reality, who
the heck know what it is going to be tomorrow!? &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;right of the advanced&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Further, when western museums were the buyer who drove all the tomb
robbers and antique traders, the sad reality back then was that local
folks didn't give a fxxx of all the mummies and monuments. So now fast
forward 150 years, it is just not reasonable
to &lt;strong&gt;blame&lt;/strong&gt; them for collecting them in the name of &lt;code&gt;loot&lt;/code&gt;
or &lt;code&gt;steal&lt;/code&gt;. Their argument is valid &amp;mdash; the antiques did have a
better chance to be preserved and to survive, and they did have a
better vision (if can be called enlightened) of the future than
others. But this leads to another dilemma.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Does it then mean that a so called &lt;em&gt;advanced&lt;/em&gt; group or society should
be in position to take over things from a &lt;em&gt;less advanced&lt;/em&gt; group so to
maximize the overall benefits of, what, society? human race?
history?... I don't find a word to describe this. But you see what I'm
driving towards right? This argument definitely feels, not right
morally, but right factually. Let's say we let them do that, and the
future proves they were right &amp;larr; both of these are pretty
&lt;strong&gt;SIGNIFICANT&lt;/strong&gt; assumptions. But does it mean that the less advanced
group will be locked in their inferior position/class forever? If I
enjoy the benefit of taking over others' stuff, what incentive do I
have to educate them and lift them up out of their existence so to
&lt;em&gt;compete&lt;/em&gt; with me!? Isn't this the exact thought any privileged
subject has and wish to maintain, forever!? So the elites rule us all,
because even you are the &lt;em&gt;privileged&lt;/em&gt; one, chances are you are not the 
single top guy of the food chain, then by this reasoning it derives
that you will also be ruled, crashed, bullied, and wasted, maybe just
with a slight less degree of destruction, but the idea is the
same. Well, then why do you want to promote that!?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;history === myth&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;How confusing! I think this whole mess of arguments really lead to the
problem that there is no &lt;em&gt;compass&lt;/em&gt; in my life these days and the line
between right and wrong is completly blurred (or just disappeared). 
I lost faith in the future, has serious contempt of the present, and
has a shaky feeling of the past. &lt;a href="https://en.wikiquote.org/wiki/George_Santayana"&gt;Santayana&lt;/a&gt; warned that "
Those who do not learn history are doomed to repeat it." But what you
learned from history isn't really a truth or even fact, but a
hindsight of judgement which itself could just be a complete wrong
in the next few decades because of the prospective shift. Then, what
could one really learn from so called history, if anything?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;马未都说："历史没有真相，只残存一个道理". Now even this seems over
optimistic. There isn't even a 道理, just a story, a legend,
a myth. So to this point, history doesn't really matter much, nor it
has any value in anything. Its left over artifacts are valuable, when
they have a market (which means someone wants it for $$). If no one
wants it, oh well, they are just a whole pile of dirt regardless what
they are named, mummy, gold, or whatever.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;"Epilogue"&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I am quoting the "epilogue" chapter of &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/Rape-Nile-Robbers-Tourists-Archaeologists/dp/0813340616"&gt;the book&lt;/a&gt;, which I feel draw a clear
picture of paradox of history that barbarians whom we so disgust
today, who looted the Niles with selfish motivation ONLY,
in the end became the driving force, though brutal and even
uncivilized judged by these days' standars, 
created a repository of treasure, even unintentionally, so
we living in this century still have some to look at and to admire. If
left to the &lt;em&gt;rightful owner&lt;/em&gt; of them (the locals, but who said they
have the right?), many we see today would have been
long gone, consumed as a trivial heating bundle in winter and
supersititious medicine, whose usage and purpose we scorn even
more I suppose, comparing to their dark fate of being moved from their
origin to a foreign location as monument, as cash machine, as a ladder
to fame and fortune for some, but in the end, as an inheritage of mankind. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Over a hundred and fifty years have passed since Giovanni Belzoni
shook the dust of Alexandria off his feed for the last time. But many
familiar scenes would greet his eyes if he were to return to the Nile
today. The pyramids still tower above the floodplain, while the Sphinx
crouches at their feed surrounded by curious tourists. The sun still
rises in a gray dawn, lights up the vast spaces of the desert, and
highlights the fertile green and cultivated land by the banks of the
Nile. The shimmering heat of midday embraces the heavy air of temple
and royal bomb in the same way that it has for centuries. White-sailed
river vessels retrace the course taken by Belzoni's ramshackle boats
and pass the scenes of this greatest exploits. There is a sense of
timelessness about the Nile that transcends the passage of years or
the stirring events of history. The visitor to the Nile can smell the
same smells as the Ancient Egyptians, of hot dust and damp reeds, of
the river itself as it flows smoothly toward the north. Every year,
like clockwork, the Nile comes down in flood, ensuring the fertility
of crops and perpetuating agricultural practices that are often little
modified from pharaonic times. One can almost sense that elusive
feeling of equilibrium and ma&amp;prime;et, that sense of rightness so
highly prized by the Ancient Egyptians as they identified with their
unchanging environment.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Belzoni had come to the Nile at a time when the full extend of the
glories of Ancient Egypt had just been revealed to the world for the
first time. The coolections of Napoleon's savants had electrified the
scholars of Europe and a craze for things Egyptian had swept the
cultivated drawing rooms of European capitals. The Rosetta Stone had
reached the British Museum; the Louvre in Paris had just unpacked its
spoils from the Nile. A surge of nationalistic lust for the precious
and exotic was filling these museums and those in other countries with
all manner of curiosities and the finest artistic achievements of
Western civilization. And Egyptian antiquities were at the top of the
curators' shopping lists. Thus the scramble for Ancient Egypt began, a
campaign of looting conducted in the name of diplomacy and leisured
cultural inquiry, which soon degenerated into an orgy of destruction,
greed, and outright profiteering. As in other parts of the world,
archaeology began as treasure hunting and then slowly evolved into a
scientific discipline armed with all the specialist methods and
techniques of the twentieth-century fieldworker. But by the time the
scientific archaeologist arrived, much of the Ancient Egypt was gone
forever, devoured by the voracious maw of the treasure hunter,
unscrupulous collection, or curious tourist.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Napoleon's mena were only human in their desire to collect Egyptian
antiquities, for the urge to collect and posses is one of the more
passionate of human desires. Time and time again the early
archaeologist was overcome with a passion to excavate, loot, or just
remove the past to another place, where he could caress it and
contemplate its glories without the disturbing qualities of its
original context. Soon European antionalism and the petty ambitions of
dislomats and statesmen became involve in the collecting business, as
many nations sought to acquire a fine repository of the most
beautiful, exotic, and valuable manifestations of Ancient Egyptian
civilization. It became fashionable to be knowledgeable about Ancient
Egyptin all its nostalgic and fascinating glory. Egypt was the epitome
of ancient civilization, that of a strong and powerful society that
had oppressed the Israelities, suffered from the Mosaic plagues, and
taken a conspicuous place in the established order of world
history. Unfortunately, knowledge coincided with ownership and profit
in many people's minds.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In a sense one cannnot blame the museum curator or collector of a
century and a half ago for the attitudes that they
possessed. Everywhere they looked they saw statuary and temples being
broken up and tombs being looted for jewelry. In Egypt nothing was
safe. But a papyrus carefully unrolled in the secluded comfort of the
British Museum was safe from destruction, cushioned with the awesome
security of the greates museum in the world. After all, as Wallis
Budge pointedly remarked, a mummy displayed in the British Museum was
very priuvileged compared with his cousins in the looted tombs of
Thebes. No on could desecrate a British Museum mummy or tear it
apart. The outrageous tactics of private purchase and surreptitious
excavation in definance of authority were condoned in the comfortable
certainty that they were the only practicable way to save Ancient
Egypt from extinction. What need, asked many people, did the Egyptians
have for their past? After all, the pasha's government was destroying
and giving it away all the time. And the fellahin seemed to have no
respected for tomb or temple or any identity with the Ancient
Egyptians themselves, only in the value of their corpses. There was
non of the local nationalistic sentiment that had stirred vigorous
public outcry in Greece when Lord Elgin removed the marble friezes
that bear his name in the British Museum from the portico of the
Parthenon. The well-heeled museum collection and tourist of a century
and a half ago was fully aware that the Ancient Egyptians themselves
had helped themselves to the contents of royal tombs. They had
viuolated their most sacred places and the royal sepulchers for gold
and a guaranteed source of wealth that would enable them to meet
life's day-to-to needs. The ancients had treated the past with a
causal cynicism that had been inherited by their successors, a
cynicism that was mathed with equal contempt by the nineteenth-century
collector. It is a miracle that anything at all has survived for us to
enjoy.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Without question, however, much of Ancient Egypt's magnificent splendor
was saved from oblivion by the aggressive policies of Wallis Budge and
other &amp;mdash; witness, to mention only a few instances, not only
Belzoni's collections, but also the Papyrus of Ani, the best and most
complete version the Book of the Dead, and the thousands of Coptic
manuscripts in the Louvre and the British Museum. By displaying their
acquisitions, the officials of major European museums, however
unscrupulous their methods, made possible a heightened awareness of
the need to learn about Ancient Egypt and to save it for proterity
before it all vanished forever.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Fortunately, when one looks back over the history of Egyptology one
views a landscape peopled by giants. Jean Francois Champollion and
John Gardner Wikinson unlocked the secrets of hieroglyphs. August
Mariette excavated for the Louvre and then became the first jealous
guardian of Ancient Egypt for serious scholar and tourish
alike. Flinders Petrie introduced modern excavation methods to the
Nile. The genius of Champollion and the passionate vagor of Mariette
resulted in the gradual creation of an organization designed to thwart
destruction and inevitable oblivion. Egypt became the first Near
Eastern country to possess a national museum, even if it began life as
a ramshackle shed in a back garden in Cairo, and even if its contents
were occasionally donated to influential visiting
dignitaries. Gradually the diplomats turned from antiquities to
political activities, while more and more people came to look rather
than loot. Egypt itself became an interesting place to visit, with the
great pyramids and temples as part of a backdrop for a thoroughly
entertaining vacation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In a sense, it was the tourist and the educated dilettante who saved
Ancient Egypt. Egypt's first Antiquities Ordinance was promulgated in
1835 and was largely ignored by those it sourght to control, for there
were no mechanisms or facilities to enforce it. Ironically, it was the
looted antiquities in European museums that caused a rising tide of
public opinion to react against the orgy of destruction. People had
admired the fine statuary in the Louvre, felt that such fine
achievements belonged to the world at large and that everyone had the
right to enjoy them. There was a slow realization that fanatics like
Mariette were correct, and that the flaboyant director of the Bulak
Museum was right to offend the covetous Empress Eugenie with here
imperious demands. Besides, tourism was good business for everyone:
for the properity of foreign trade, for European political interests
in the near East, for the Egyptians, and for the tourists
themselves. How could there be any tourism if there were no temples,
tombs, or museum collections for the visitor to admire?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The studied logic and efficient bureaucracy of Britical rule in Egypt
finally created, albeit slowly, a change in public attitudes within
Egypt itself. Amelia Edwards journeyed through Egypt at the beginning
of a long period of relative political stability, when the Antiquities
Service began to develop a network of guards and active intelligence
agents employed to prevent illegal collecting and the further rape of
Ancient Egypt. Of course, there were incidents of scandalous
corruption and brazen tomb robbing, some of them associated with
respectable museums, but the tilde of public attitude and
archaelogical morality had turned imperceptibly in favor of
preservation and scientific excavation. Even those who chose to paint
their names on the great temples were publicly excoriated for their
conspicuous sins. It became harder to remove antiquities from Egypt
and more fashionable to consider the Cairo Museum as one of the
foremost repositories for Ancient Egypt in the world, a museum soon to
be staffed by Egyptians themselves.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The stolid facade of the British Empire fostered a risiging sense of
nationalism in Egypt, ad elsewhere, a latent resentment of foreign
rule and British imperialism, a greater identity with the long and
fascinating kaleidoscope of history that the Egyptians could look back
upon. This nationalism manifested itself in political events, which
are familiar to us all, but also in an abhorrence of a "cultural
imperialism" that chose to remove the choicest achievements of
antiquity to foreign climates. The magnificient  discovery of the
undisturbed tomb of Tut-ankh-Amun in 1922 merely fueled the sentiment
against foreign excavation and exploitation of Ancient Egypt, although
Lord Carnarvon gave the royal tomb's contents to the Cairo Museum. By
the 1920s foreign expeditions were rarely found in Egypt, for there
were few rewards for well-financed museum expeditions that depends on
rich finds to attract generous benefactors. A long drawn-out stand-off
between the acquisitors of major foreign museums and the Egyptian
Antiquities Service reflected a hardened attitude, one where sharing
of a unique cultural heritage with other nations was morally
unacceptable. Few scholars were able to dig in Egypt on the scale that
archaeologists like Petrie had regarded as commonplace. It is only
recent years that Egypt has opened its doors to foreign archaeologists
again, this time on a carefully controlled scale.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But now the international climate for archaeology has changed, in a
world that is ardently nationalist and increasingly jealous of its
diverse cultural heritages. People are far more aware of enormous
contribution that the discipline can make to the proper study of
humankind. Today, they wealth of Ancient Egypt is spread through the
museums of several continents. Mummy after mummy, sarcophagus after
sarcophagus, statue after statue, museum storerooms and galleries, are
filled with the dusty remains of Egyptian antiquity. Most were
acquired by private collectors and then donated to the museums, or
acquired in massive field seasons, supported by private donations,
where often quantity was more important thant quality. The large
expeditions and casual collecting forays of half a century ago have
been replaced by an illegal antiquities traffic that feeds on the law
of supply and demand and the avaricious acquisition policies of large
museums and wealthy collectors. Journalist Karl Meyer has documented
this nefarious trade with its long ancestry in the activities of
Belzoni and his kind in &lt;em&gt;The Plundered Past&lt;/em&gt;, a devastating indictment
of the mechanics of the twentieth-century antiquities trade. Meyer
describes public consciousness of the seriousness of hte problem as
being at about "stage zero", for the importantce of archaeology and
its significance to humankind is something that is theoretically easy
to understand, has been rarely discussed at length in print, and is
far harder to comprehend in practice. It is certainly almost
impossible to persuade taxpayers to pay for archaeology when the
thorny issue of limited resources and ordered priorities comes up.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;...&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The passion ofr collecting dies hard, especially in times of recession
or mushrooming art prices. Nor does it perish in the face of attitudes
like those of New York art dealer Andre Emmerich who was bold enough
to say in public a few years ago that he thought the United States
"more than any other [country] has a special claim to the arts of all
mankind." We live in what are sometimes called enlightened times, but
they can hardly be described as enlightened in terms of antiquity, as
long as these sorts of attitudes pervade public thinking. Many
archaeologists are wondering if there is a future for the past and
some fear that Ancient Egypt is faced with total extinction. But let
us take heart from the immortal and inspired words of the great Jean
Francois Champollion:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Egypt is always herself, at all stages in her hitory, always great
and powerful in art and enlightenment. Going backthrough the
centuries, we see her always shining with the same brilliance, and the
only thing we lack to satisfy our curiosity is a knowledge of the
origin and growth of civilization itself.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As these pages have shown, at least something has been done to satisfy
Champollion's, and our, curiosity.

&lt;p&gt;Have you had this experience, that something you are familiar with,
suddenly slowed down, which made you feel that everything was in a
slow motion? &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I know, it sounds pretty strange, and it is indeed strange. On the way
to work this morning I was listening to
my &lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1s4YQqnbnM8"&gt;all time favourate movie&lt;/a&gt;, and for some reason I was playing it
in a 1.5x slower speed than normal, and how strange it all sounded!
The speech, the music, the vibes, all slowed down just a bit! I could
still tell the voices, plots, not like that the voice was changed to
some low tone when you play the records really really slowly. No. They
were pretty much intact, but you could sense the pace of it felt,

&lt;p&gt;I wouldn't think it will make much of a difference if you just played

has ingrained you with a certain &lt;strong&gt;perception&lt;/strong&gt; which created this
disparity effect. So like everything else, it's your own perception

sad. Really. I never met the guy, but honestly, I have zero interest
meeting him or even talking to him. Just by looking at his
&lt;em&gt;professional&lt;/em&gt; profile gives me a fit, a young HR director in the 30s
and is &lt;em&gt;workholic&lt;/em&gt;... but really, my experience with Chinese version of
workholic is that they work in low efficiency, has no vision
of the work they are working on, putting in no thoughts into how 
to make this work better because they are plainly told what to do so
they think they are doing the job just because they are doing what was
told. Often they have zero understanding (or worse, wrong
understandings) of the objective, and just blindly executing them
since the boss is the brain &amp;mdash; just so wrong! There is no
crowd wisdom, no contribution, no discussion, no collaboration,
just command and &lt;strong&gt;serfdom&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Really. Even as a HR person, if his style is just telling ppl what to
do without asking, motivating, inspiring and encouraging, forget it,
he is in the &lt;strong&gt;wrong&lt;/strong&gt; business, and whoever puts him in this position
has no fxxx clue what HR is about &amp;rarr; it's not a management,
hello!!!? It's not hiring, training, filling a position where another
screw is needed. It's caring and monitoring and putting yourself into
others' pain and frustration at work, and trying to understand,
to balance, and to make ppl feel comfortable with where they are and
what they do. That's hard work because who wants to really understand
another human's problem and ambition and problems in life?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I don't know. This world is crazy. The BS ppl gets what they want by
elbowing other ppl aside, while rewards go to these bullies. It's a
Darwin's jungle. Sometimes I wonder whether this is also just my
perception, like the slow motion experience I just had this morning?
But, as of this moment, I think not. They are just BS ppl, and they
disgust me to the core, not because they are bad or anything, but
because they dress themselves up as if they are intelligent and
powerful and knowing what they are doing, while in my eyes they
are imbecile and coward that they took the easy way out by
shouting their want but no asking and interest of what they mean to
others.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So, fellas, if you ever come across my path that way, don't even slow
down. Just go as fast as you are preferring to, to your hell.&lt;/p&gt;</content><category term="thoughts"></category><category term="thoughts"></category></entry><entry><title>Anonymous</title><link href="https://fengxia41103.github.io/myblog/anonymous.html" rel="alternate"></link><published>2017-10-20T10:00:00-04:00</published><updated>2017-10-20T10:00:00-04:00</updated><author><name>Feng Xia</name></author><id>tag:fengxia41103.github.io,2017-10-20:/myblog/anonymous.html</id><summary type="html">&lt;p&gt;A poor-man's version my loved &lt;strong&gt;La La Land&lt;/strong&gt; in which

&lt;p&gt;I don't know why, but ordinary, common people with a sincere attitude
and a smile will always move me, better than any shining armor, social
status, halo on the head and a badge of prestige. I think the trick is
that they are real, they experience agony and frustration like
everyone else, and they hold up a hope as fearless, and more often
fearsome, to struggle, to wish, to work for it, to fall, and to fall
again.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It is not motivating at all. On the contrary, it echos what I feel
about myself and of life &amp;mdash; endless tunnel to run through without
seeing a light at the end of it. What propells you to continue the run
then, if there is no one waiting for or to cheer you for your
footsteps? It's easy to throw the word &lt;strong&gt;dreams&lt;/strong&gt; around, as if
everyone does have dream, I mean the actual, happening-when-you-sleep,
kind of the brain activity &amp;mdash; even this isn't necessarily true,
right? What do you call a dream? A mental wandering astray from
reality? or just a different projection of the same &lt;em&gt;reality&lt;/em&gt;?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Then, there is this hypothetical &lt;em&gt;dream&lt;/em&gt; that pumps your blood and
loads you with spirit so to overcome obstacles and curve balls. These
folks had dreams. It is admirable to live for something you believe
in. I think the trouble really starts when you start to find it difficult
to believe in &lt;em&gt;anything&lt;/em&gt; &amp;mdash; when you can see there are always two
sides of every single coin that flies around, belief really becomes a
betting process in which you are convinced your odds are good.&lt;/p&gt;</content><category term="thoughts"></category><category term="thoughts"></category></entry><entry><title>Bad day</title><link href="https://fengxia41103.github.io/myblog/bad%20day.html" rel="alternate"></link><published>2017-10-12T11:10:00-04:00</published><updated>2017-10-12T11:10:00-04:00</updated><author><name>Feng Xia</name></author><id>tag:fengxia41103.github.io,2017-10-12:/myblog/bad day.html</id><summary type="html">&lt;figure class="col l6 m6 s12"&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I'm obsessed by &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/La_La_Land_(film)"&gt;La la land&lt;/a&gt;. How many times have I watched and
listened to this film? I'm playing it everyday now at work as it is
also the only movie I loaded on this computer. While I was doing it, I
was thinking what I would like to hear when I need a little sound, and
it was the only one I wanted then.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Got curious of its reviews, I know, I haven't read any of others'
reviews of it till now. But honestly, like the guy in the film, why do
I care what other people say about it, if myself enjoys it already?
Who the hell care what they say? So what surprised me, as well as
impressed me, was that it was done with 30 million dollars, and the
director's first film, &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Whiplash_(2014_film)"&gt;Whipsplash&lt;/a&gt;, was done in 3. What am I
trying to say? is that whenever I was hearing the piano theme of La la

trying to say? is that whenever I was hearing the piano theme of La la
land, I felt deeply moved as if the sweet and bitter memory came into
life, dancing, starting at me, asking me to rejoin it and to relive
it. &lt;strong&gt;That, is magical.&lt;/strong&gt; I can't help thinking that with that much
budget, how many technology projects I have witnessed or heard that
had flushed down the drain, and the same budget that produced music,
literature, choreography, film, that has touched your inner self with
a timeless effect? Wouldn't that be a better way to spend and to
invest?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Growing older, I began to feel more and more of the magic of arts,
which in so many ways is contradicting with my profession as a
computer guy, which speaks hard, cold, seemingly objective logic of
if-else. Going into the Boston Arts Museum, the first time seeing Van
Gogh's painting was breathtaking &amp;mdash; they were sooo small, soooo
colorful, soooo different from anything else in that room &amp;mdash; even
as an engineer I couldn't help wondering how he did it, or even
perceived this, view!? You know, countless times at work I felt down
not because how hard the task was, but how &lt;strong&gt;thoughtless&lt;/strong&gt; sometimes I
felt towards the problem, yes, it is just scary when you find yourself
having no mental picture of a path to even try, the feeling of a dead
end.  So here are these arts, speak to you with their own life,
touches your soul, disturb an ebb that feel so remote, yet so real, so
you.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Maybe, art is a greater form than hi-tech, and being an artist who can
write and produce these timeless pieces, is a greater mind. The piano
of the La la land, will sadden you one day too, when the reality
collapses all around. &lt;/p&gt;</content><category term="thoughts"></category><category term="thoughts"></category></entry><entry><title>Say, no</title><link href="https://fengxia41103.github.io/myblog/say%20no.html" rel="alternate"></link><published>2017-09-28T12:58:00-04:00</published><updated>2017-09-28T12:58:00-04:00</updated><author><name>Feng Xia</name></author><id>tag:fengxia41103.github.io,2017-09-28:/myblog/say no.html</id><summary type="html">&lt;figure class="col l6 m6 s12 center"&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Browsing wechat friend posts, and one image, as common as it actually
is, the &lt;strong&gt;never say no&lt;/strong&gt; type of moral pump, suddenly got me thinking.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I used to think the &lt;em&gt;can do&lt;/em&gt; attitude is so positive, energetic,
optimistic, worth holding on, worth broadcasting, worth preaching,
worth teaching, worth affecting everyone around me. After all, wasn't
that my motto and I tried to teach Noah that, too, that the &lt;em&gt;never
give up&lt;/em&gt; spirit? But when it is used &lt;em&gt;broadly&lt;/em&gt;
within a context just about anything you can think of, in job, in life,
it feels so, vain, so going into a battle while disregarding the odds
in reality. What about cut loss and run?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Why never say no!? How do you know the condition permits you to say
yes? shouldn't we just quit, sometimes, when our judgement tells us
it's not a good idea to go forward? Like yesterday when Noah and I
played openra and the rush AI just threw at me an army of artileries

example and message I have just sent to Noah then? Quitting? Giving
up? but don't we sometimes just need a reset? Yes, I think we all do.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Further, wouldn't it be better to question &lt;em&gt;everything&lt;/em&gt; instead of
just accepting the status quo and nod? Why should I commit myself into
a &lt;em&gt;never say no&lt;/em&gt; land while no one, including me, has an idea, has
control, of the future? Even if I agree with the slogan, isn't it just
an empty promise? Interestingly this morning NPR was talking about the
NFL kneeling down situation, and one girl was saying "they never fully
explained what this is about? how long is it going to be? how far is
it going to be? what are we trying to achieve? why am I doing this?
.... " exactly. Aren't we supposed to do our own critical thinking
just like that so to make our own &lt;em&gt;judgement&lt;/em&gt; on these issues, any issues?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I think the &lt;em&gt;can do&lt;/em&gt; attitude is still good, but not with a slogan-ish
propaganda blanketing everything underneath. Yes you need to hold on
to difficult times, if you decide it is worthwhile, for whatever
justification you have for yourself. No one should tell you to do
that; yourself is the only agent you can rely on, should rely on, and
can rely on. Use your own judgement, don't just say yes. Question the
heart out of its origin, intention, argument and assumption. I really
like the her line "why am I doing this?" You can still do it, or not,
just that it is a conscious decision instead of someone made the
decision for you, &lt;span class="myhighlight"&gt;because otherwise, you
actually &lt;em&gt;gave yourself up&lt;/em&gt; while you thought you were living towards
to the &lt;em&gt;never give-up&lt;/em&gt; life, and how ironic that will be&lt;/span&gt;.

&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;What is a &lt;a href="https://www.wikiwand.com/en/Nationalism"&gt;nationalism&lt;/a&gt;? Is it a bad thing, or a good thing? The
word always reminds me the dawn of WWII that Japan empire was, in my
history education, powered by its fanatic nationalism spirits to
conquer the world and to bring prosperity to its &lt;em&gt;new lands&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What made me think of this word, however, is something that
parallels this feeling, and I don't know yet how to put it
&amp;mdash; China's 大国崛起, its ambition to reestablish its past glory
(presumably existed in history, which I actually have a quite
different opinion), which in many cases involves two themes &amp;mdash; to
get a campus of followers (surrounding neighbours), and to live a life
of the good, old times.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But, this is really troublesome, to me. First of all, the glory of
leadership is a terrible thought. This is consistent of the
hierarchical structure you see everywhere China that somehow someone
must be the &lt;em&gt;boss&lt;/em&gt; while everyone else around him/her will be

leadership is a terrible thought. This is consistent of the
hierarchical structure you see everywhere China that somehow someone
must be the &lt;em&gt;boss&lt;/em&gt; while everyone else around him/her will be
obedient. Not only this is a social dynamics leading to rigid command
chain thus staleness, but if you ever look at the  countries around
us and ask yourself how many devoted admirers there are, the practical
answer is, &lt;strong&gt;none&lt;/strong&gt;. That's right, none. There is no single country
around the China's &lt;em&gt;virtual sphere&lt;/em&gt; that will kowtow, because they
look at this giant next door not as a powerful neighbour with a smile
and friendship, but a powerful neighbour with an unpredictable
temper. I don't recall where I picked up this line, but the best
analysis of the image of China was summarized as "Having a big China
is like you are sitting on a subway, and here comes sits down a big
guy next to you with tattoos and no shirt on"... So if we think about
in our life how you will like someone like that, you start to realize
that an affection (between two people) is more about similar taste,
view of the world, education, flavor of coffee, favourate movie,
sports, and so on, rather than a party's sheer power. If the formers
grow apart, one's power can only become a threat instead of a selling
point.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Second, the thought of living the past glory, and to live the good old
time. I constantly find myself wanting to go to the past (of my life)
because I miss the girls I loved and wished a different outcome with
them if I could turn back the clock. So I'm guilty as charged. The
talk about how rich 宋朝 dynasty was, and how wonderful they were
treating people, how well doing people were (according to novels like
金瓶梅) all sound romantic. There might even be a trace of
unsatisfaction of the present because, otherwise, why would you go
back? But if one takes a step back, I think this is really a human
tendency to &lt;em&gt;romanticize the past&lt;/em&gt;. Past wasn't that good; it's just
the brain (and history) filtered the unpleasants and left you with all
the happiness and fun. Take 宋朝 for example, the life quality you are
enjoying today is far superior to the emperor back then &amp;mdash; he had
no TV, no car, no fitness center, no flu shot, no ice cream , no plane
to travel, no ipad, no swimming pool, no Nike shoe, no bike, no talk
show, no library, no book store, no coffee shop, no Mozart... 
what he had was just power, human labor, and an illusion of glory
because he truly believed his empire was the center of the universe!
But really, if anyone can hold that type of thoughts (and I actually
have met quite many who do!), they don't need to go back to the past,
they are living the past! &amp;mdash; they all think they are powerful,
and they are the best... give me a break! &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If that's the type of price to pay to be glorified again, I don't want
it. It's far better to be humbled because you realize how big the
world is, how diversified people are, how split views of a seemingly
common sense can be, how little you know, and how much you haven't got
chance to learn... everytime I walk into a book store or a museum, I
felt so insignificant because here I was, standing in front of presence
of master minds of human specie who had done something tremendously outstanding,
even vulgar arts count &amp;mdash; they are reality of someone's mind and effort,
so I admire that achievement of 0&amp;rarr;1. So why would one want to
live in a cave just be called a king and feel good about himself?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I think it's all about power, the pipe dream of power, the thought
that the country is now powerful, and I want to be that part of power,
somehow. This, is what I call &lt;strong&gt;Chinese nationalism in the 21st
century&lt;/strong&gt;.  How sad, how ridiculous, how dangerous a thought! No,
seriously, you don't want to live in 宋朝 for its so called glory.
Just think about it, &lt;span class="myhighlight"&gt;why would you live a
life in which salt is a government monopolized, precious
stuff&lt;/span&gt;?... if you are really addicted to power, the last thing
you want is to have someone's finger on your salt supply valve and
grin.&lt;/p&gt;</content><category term="thoughts"></category><category term="thoughts"></category></entry><entry><title>sharing economy</title><link href="https://fengxia41103.github.io/myblog/sharing%20economy.html" rel="alternate"></link><published>2017-08-31T20:21:00-04:00</published><updated>2017-08-31T20:21:00-04:00</updated><author><name>Feng Xia</name></author><id>tag:fengxia41103.github.io,2017-08-31:/myblog/sharing economy.html</id><summary type="html">&lt;figure class="col l4 m4 s12"&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.wikiwand.com/en/Sharing_economy"&gt;Sharing economy&lt;/a&gt; is hot. Looking around, one can't help feeling
just about everything can be shared. But then, you can't help asking
yourself, "where does it end?"&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Really, so cars can be shared, houses can be shared, &lt;a href="http://www.scmp.com/news/china/society/article/2106688/shared-folding-stool-service-launched-beijing-over-half-go"&gt;stools&lt;/a&gt; can
be shared, &lt;a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2017/07/18/bike-sharing-boom-in-china-pedals-to-new-heights.html"&gt;bikes&lt;/a&gt; can be shared... so what can not be? Practically
nothing. I think the generalization roots in the word &lt;strong&gt;share&lt;/strong&gt; as
itself really doesn't rule out all the confusions out there &amp;mdash;
are bike sharing really "sharing"? or are they just a leasing in
disguise? what makes you think one way or the other? what is sharing?
I told Noah to share his toys, but to think of it, he didn't
necessarily own the toys (for example, when he was in preschool), so
the &lt;strong&gt;sharing&lt;/strong&gt; was really an intention, a spiritual openness with
benefiting others in mind. Since he is a kid, sharing toys is
encouraged; but what if he is an adult and I'm encouraging him to
share something that doesn't even belong to him at the first place?

share something that doesn't even belong to him at the first place?
What's the message then? What does it even mean?  It feels, bad,
doesn't it? After all, I certainly don't want any two Pol just come
along and decide to &lt;em&gt;share&lt;/em&gt; my thing that neither of them owns. I'll
be like, what the heck?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;my definitions&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So I tried to think of a narrower and clearer definition for &lt;strong&gt;sharing&lt;/strong&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;you own the resource that you are sharing&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;benefits created are not determined by increase of resource amount, but
   by better utilization (interchangeably, efficiency) of existing
   resource. &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I like the 2nd point. It's easier to use a bit math here: &lt;code&gt;over all
value = unit value * qty&lt;/code&gt;.  So to increase the &lt;code&gt;over all value&lt;/code&gt;, you
either increase &lt;code&gt;unit value&lt;/code&gt;, thus a unit's efficiency , or &lt;code&gt;qty&lt;/code&gt;. I
think sharing is all about the &lt;code&gt;unit value&lt;/code&gt; (utilize an idle
resource). What we are seeing of the explosive increase of &lt;code&gt;qty&lt;/code&gt; is
just a side effect when more ppl want to participate, but &lt;span
class="myhighlight"&gt;&lt;code&gt;qty&lt;/code&gt; is not sharing.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The &lt;strong&gt;owner&lt;/strong&gt; prospective, however, bothers me. On one hand it feels
just right that you can/should only share what you own &amp;mdash; your
vacant room, your bike, your tools... but on the other hand, can't you
just share anything? I mean, there just isn't anything you own you can
not give it a &lt;code&gt;sharing&lt;/code&gt; spin &amp;mdash; stuff, time, service, &lt;span
class="myhighlight"&gt;what about prostitutes? If it is the oldest
profession, isn't it also the oldest sharing economy!?&lt;/span&gt; If so,
why we are condemning them but praising these so called innovations?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We should not. I think sharing implies a sense of motivated
willingness and pride, that first of all I &lt;span
class="myhighlight"&gt;like this thing&lt;/span&gt; &amp;mdash; I'm taking proud of
my lovely house, thus wanting to have you experience that (after all,
who wants to just share &lt;strong&gt;crappy&lt;/strong&gt; side of his/her stuff). I would
almost argue that &lt;span class="myhighlight"&gt; you should like it to the
point you don't want to share, thus making sharing such an emotional
experience, that the challenge to overcome unwillingness and to
convince youself doing it is the true ingredient that makes sharing
valuable and noble&lt;/span&gt;. Without this emotional pride that you
invest in it, this whole process, being called sharing or not, is
nothing but another a emotionless, number-matching business
transaction.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So here it is, a number 3:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;...&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;...&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;you like what you are sharing&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Putting this lens on, you will now see how bullshit all these &lt;a href="https://www.cbsnews.com/news/china-popular-sharing-economy-exploding-didi/"&gt;China-invented&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;sharing hoax&lt;/strong&gt; really are.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;wiki and quotes&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I got curious and read about &lt;a href="https://www.wikiwand.com/en/Sharing_economy"&gt;sharing economy&lt;/a&gt;, boy, wasn't I
impressed! What a wonderful summary of everything I am feeling about
this topic but failed to express them well! There are a few slips I
think they hit nails on the head, which I'll be quoting here:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;misnomer&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Harvard Business Review argues that "sharing economy" is a
misnomer, and that the correct word for this activity is "access
economy". The authors say, "When "sharing" is market-mediated—when a
company is an intermediary between consumers who don't know each
other—it is no longer sharing at all. Rather, consumers are paying to
access someone else's goods or services."[14] The article goes on to
show that companies (such as Uber) who understand this, and whose
marketing highlights the financial benefits to participants, are
successful, while companies (such as Lyft) whose marketing highlights
the social benefits of the service are less successful.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;not a gift economy&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Salon writes that "the sharing economy ... [is] not the Internet
'gift economy' as originally conceived, a utopia in which we all
benefit from our voluntary contributions. It's something quite
different—the relentless co-optation of the gift economy by market
capitalism. The sharing economy, as practiced by Silicon Valley, is
a betrayal of the gift economy. The potlatch has been paved over,
and replaced with a digital shopping mall."&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;driven by job loss&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;New York Magazine wrote that the sharing economy has succeeded in
large part because the real economy has been
struggling. Specifically, in the magazine's view, the sharing
economy succeeds because of a depressed labor market, in which "lots
of people are trying to fill holes in their income by monetizing
their stuff and their labor in creative ways", and that in many
cases, people join the sharing economy because they've recently lost
a full-time job, including a few cases where the pricing structure
of the sharing economy may have made their old jobs less profitable
(e.g. full-time taxi drivers who may have switched to Lyft or
Uber). The magazine writes that "In almost every case, what compels
people to open up their homes and cars to complete strangers is
money, not trust. ... Tools that help people trust in the kindness
of strangers might be pushing hesitant sharing-economy participants
over the threshold to adoption. But what's getting them to the
threshold in the first place is a damaged economy, and harmful
public policy that has forced millions of people to look to odd jobs
for sustenance."&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;low labor cost&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Andrew Leonard,[106][107][108] Evgeny Morozov,[109] Bernard
Marszalek,[110] Dean Baker,[111][112] and Andrew Keen[113]
criticized the for-profit sector of the sharing economy, writing
that sharing economy businesses "extract" profits from their given
sector by "successfully [making] an end run around the existing
costs of doing business" - taxes, regulations, and
insurance. Similarly, In the context of online freelancing
marketplaces, there have been worries that the sharing economy could
result in a 'race to the bottom' in terms or wages and benefits: as
millions of new workers from low-income countries come online.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;no magic in trust&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;the sharing economy "doesn't build trust" because where it builds
new connections, it often "replicates old patterns of privileged
access for some, and denial for others".[116] William Alden wrote
that "The so-called sharing economy is supposed to offer a new kind
of capitalism, one where regular folks, enabled by efficient online
platforms, can turn their fallow assets into cash machines ... But
the reality is that these markets also tend to attract a class of
well-heeled professional operators, who outperform the amateurs—just
like the rest of the economy".&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And finally, an article on &lt;a href="https://hbr.org/2015/01/the-sharing-economy-isnt-about-sharing-at-all"&gt;HBR&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;</content><category term="thoughts"></category><category term="thoughts"></category></entry><entry><title>People psyche</title><link href="https://fengxia41103.github.io/myblog/people%20psyche.html" rel="alternate"></link><published>2017-08-23T12:21:00-04:00</published><updated>2017-08-23T12:21:00-04:00</updated><author><name>Feng Xia</name></author><id>tag:fengxia41103.github.io,2017-08-23:/myblog/people psyche.html</id><summary type="html">&lt;figure class="col l4 m4 s12"&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Have you observed something that ppl do, and you just wonder &lt;em&gt;what the
hell&lt;/em&gt;*? Yes, I find human behavior very puzzling. Maybe it's just me
that is not connected with surroundings and felt isolated. But
seriously, there are just these things that ppl do that I can't help
thinking the word &lt;code&gt;irrational&lt;/code&gt; is too polite to describe.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;These days, nothing annoys me more than the morning rush and
aggressive drivers.  So I was driving to work seven o'clock in the
morning in my little Prius C which can only go that fast on the road
anyway, and boy, cars were just tailgating, then got impatience, swing
to the next lane, bypassing me as if running from a disease, there
might even be some dirty look involved and a few curses like &lt;code&gt;asian
guy just doesn't know how to drive&lt;/code&gt; that type of thing. But
seriously!? &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;First of all, there are like a million cars right in front of me, and
they are all driving more or less in the same speed, so
bypassing me at …&lt;/p&gt;</summary><content type="html">&lt;figure class="col l4 m4 s12"&gt;

seriously!? &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;First of all, there are like a million cars right in front of me, and
they are all driving more or less in the same speed, so
bypassing me at your top speed only means one thing &amp;rarr; step
on your brake so you don't hit the car right in front of me
&amp;rarr; seriously, don't you know &lt;code&gt;distance / speed = time&lt;/code&gt;?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Just out of curiosity, who leaves house seven o'clock in the morning
instead of staying in their cozy houses? Chances are we are all going
to work. Well, so ask yourself, how many ppl you know who at least
claim that they *&lt;em&gt;love&lt;/em&gt; their jobs? Few I suppose. So here are these
enthusiastic drivers who are &lt;em&gt;eager&lt;/em&gt; to get to work! I mean, I can
understand there are some ppl who might have emergency to take care,
some who are just love their jobs, but seriously, the disproportional
number of cars going fast on the road just amazes me. I wonder what
type of paradise they work at?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On the similar note, if you do have something so important that you
have to rush like this, well, quoting my beloved &lt;a href="http://questromapps.bu.edu/mgmt_new/Profiles/MichelAllen.html"&gt;Professor Michel&lt;/a&gt;:
&lt;span class="myhighlight"&gt;there is always an earlier train&lt;/span&gt;. So
get up earlier! The highway is open &lt;code&gt;24x7&lt;/code&gt;, you know that, right?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And here is something even more fantastic. Ppl literally step on their
gas to pass me while I was cruising towards a &lt;span
class="myhighlight"&gt;RED&lt;/span&gt; light!? wow, this is just beyond my
comprehension completly, ultimately, thoroughly. &lt;em&gt;uh, are you going
to drive through it?&lt;/em&gt; I would love to see it. I thought you are in a
hurry, why stop?... I don't know. They are either blind, or just
stupid. If passing me gives them pleasure, I guess that's one positive
way to look at this.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Then, there is the control. There have been quite a few times the
annoying driver turned out be someone working in the same company
cause we all pulled in the same parking lot. Here stepping out some
harmless looking man or woman, I just wonder why they were so
&lt;em&gt;impatient&lt;/em&gt; while now they are just taking the slow stroll as everyone
else to the office, no hurry, no rush, no enthusiasm anymore. Why?
Were they really pushy, or it was just my perception that was faulty?
I tend to blame the rear view mirror for this &amp;mdash; didn't it have a
label saying "&lt;em&gt;object seems closer than it actually is&lt;/em&gt;"? But then,
why making them look closer, if being closer makes personal
uncomfortable? Yeah, it's all rear view mirror's fault. Peace.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Pickups. Pickups are the worst. They bully, just because they
can. Once a while I got the same &lt;code&gt;move over slow ass&lt;/code&gt; type of gesture
from small engine cars, too! and that just felt strange. Shouldn't we
small engines support each other? Apparently not so. This, I think,
also signifies what we see in society, that ppl in weak positions
don't bundle together. Instead, they actually tread each other to get
ahead, even the gain is small. Interesting. But don't they sometimes
all uniformly doing the same &lt;strong&gt;wrongs&lt;/strong&gt; also as if they are so tightly
integrated that nothing different can be tolerated and even imagined!?
So what sway them one way or another?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I don't know. Human is a mysterious being to me. Or, maybe my sense
just got it all wrong. How sad.&lt;/p&gt;</content><category term="thoughts"></category><category term="thoughts"></category></entry><entry><title>Modern slavery</title><link href="https://fengxia41103.github.io/myblog/modern%20slavery.html" rel="alternate"></link><published>2017-08-12T16:27:00-04:00</published><updated>2017-08-12T16:27:00-04:00</updated><author><name>Feng Xia</name></author><id>tag:fengxia41103.github.io,2017-08-12:/myblog/modern slavery.html</id><summary type="html">&lt;figure class="col l6 m6 s12"&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I'm convinced now that the number one problem I am annoyed by the
modern Chinese culture is that it create self-contradictory
person. They speak in logics however they see fit without being aware
of that two points coming out of their mouth are actually
contradictory. Take it further, they took a one-sided view of history
in such a self-confidence that they completly fail to realize that what
they are bragging and broadcasting are exactly the same thing in
history they vow to be a terrible deed by any measure.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;Trade&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A case in point is the popular place such as the &lt;a href="http://www.baike.com/wiki/%E5%A5%B6%E5%A5%B6%E5%BA%99"&gt;奶奶庙&lt;/a&gt;. I think
the debate of it in the context of pop art or even pioneer art is
completly a walk-around. Can people idol these objects? of
course. Can they bring peace and love? Doesn't matter, and to some,
yes, so be it. Are they arts? Yes. Are they art I like? No. Should I
respect its right to be there? Yes, as long as I don't go there, and

it doesn't come close me.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So what is my point!? If you ask any Chinese about the dark age in Europe,
黑暗的中世纪, the years when China was supposed to be glorious and
prosperous and everywhere else is just, dark, they will all agree on
one well-known example that church was selling coupon to save people's
soul, for a monetary price. It's an example how ridiculous the western
religion had become, and how shameless and greedy these religious man
had become. Shame on them! But you know what!? Visitors of the 奶奶庙
are exactly doing that &amp;mdash; trade! I pay you some due, and you give
me luck in turn. This is exactly what the dark age priests were doing,
so we were told, and we are all disgusted by it. But we are doing it, 
everywhere!!!!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And let's be clear of one thing &amp;mdash; this is not religion. Religion
has fear; here has none.  It is an outcry to put this in the setting
of a religion, while you trade for personal benefits and leave out
guilt all at the same place, at the same time. This is exactly how
Chinese are operating today &amp;mdash; dressing up as if it is a noble
deed in which you believe, you respect and you fear, but the truth is
they just want both sides of a coin, a mission impossible, as the
deal.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;Slave&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If we take this even further, it's quite entertaining.  If that traffic
Godness casts you a good luck, who is to make up the accident
statistics? If EVERYONE is now praying for the same Godness, does it
just eliminate accidents entirely!? What if two pray to two different
Gods, since we are geographically apart and my local people just made
up a new God who has the same purpose?  Woudln't then become a race
between the two Gods, that the stronger one will fulfill its
protection, while the other one fails? So we are back to the &lt;strong&gt;old
time&lt;/strong&gt; when Gods are fighting, for us human, and we can only watch and
bear their outcome? If so, aren't we just paying them to do our fight?
Apparently so! This is a &lt;span class="myhighlight"&gt;crowd
sourcing&lt;/span&gt; boxing ring in which these made up Gods are going to compete
for their made up powers! How can then this be not comical!!!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Even more. These Gods are in a really sad position. Even if they had
the power as they say, they have no option to back out a deal. I can
pay the due when I feel so, and as soon as I pay it, the contract is
formed. The poor statue can't say no! So I could be a terrible bad
driver, and this traffic Godness is &lt;strong&gt;made&lt;/strong&gt; to protect me (if she
wins the God-fighting ring) without an option.  I think we will all
agree that this is a terrible position to be in. Literally the Godness
loses control of her own work &amp;mdash; this is like you work as a
slave, you do what is told &amp;mdash; so who is the master now!?
haha.. this is really interesting!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Anyway. I just wanted to point out, how ridiculous the logic is that
this thing implies. It validates the feeling that when you look at it
or hearing about it, you feel that something is not right, and you
know that even the prayers are not really &lt;em&gt;believing&lt;/em&gt; this &amp;mdash;
it's a play in which they play a role. Prayers get a psyche boost, the
Godness gets nothing, and the operators get money. And who are these
operators? They are the slave owners in our era.&lt;/p&gt;</content><category term="thoughts"></category><category term="thoughts"></category></entry><entry><title>Art, a thought</title><link href="https://fengxia41103.github.io/myblog/art%20a%20thought.html" rel="alternate"></link><published>2017-08-12T12:08:00-04:00</published><updated>2017-08-12T12:08:00-04:00</updated><author><name>Feng Xia</name></author><id>tag:fengxia41103.github.io,2017-08-12:/myblog/art a thought.html</id><summary type="html">&lt;figure class="col l6 m6 s12"&gt;

&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Finished reading Kenneth Clark's &lt;a href="https://www.wikiwand.com/en/Civilisation_(TV_series)"&gt;Civilisation&lt;/a&gt;. I can't say I
actually understand the book, because nearly every item he was talking
about and describing with passion and logic, I had little idea. I
barely recognized some names, and very little of the
artifacts. Sculptures, some; paintings, nearly none; background
history and social context, zero. Even the wordings he used were
elusive to me, because it felt &lt;em&gt;discrete&lt;/em&gt; in a sense of continuity of
meaning &amp;mdash; I could recognize most of the words, then never saw
the pattern that this word is connected with that word in a sentence,
and had no idea what this combination means!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;Art?&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Alas! This is terrible. Here I am, reading a classic on

mind I was thinking, isn't this the same feeling of ignorance and
disconnect when foreigner looks at Chinese arts? and what about the
most recent news of &lt;a href="http://www.baike.com/wiki/%E5%A5%B6%E5%A5%B6%E5%BA%99"&gt;奶奶庙&lt;/a&gt;, that people are debating whether

&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Finished reading Kenneth Clark's &lt;a href="https://www.wikiwand.com/en/Civilisation_(TV_series)"&gt;Civilisation&lt;/a&gt;. I can't say I
actually understand the book, because nearly every item he was talking
about and describing with passion and logic, I had little idea. I
barely recognized some names, and very little of the
artifacts. Sculptures, some; paintings, nearly none; background
history and social context, zero. Even the wordings he used were
elusive to me, because it felt &lt;em&gt;discrete&lt;/em&gt; in a sense of continuity of
meaning &amp;mdash; I could recognize most of the words, then never saw
the pattern that this word is connected with that word in a sentence,
and had no idea what this combination means!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;Art?&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Alas! This is terrible. Here I am, reading a classic on
&lt;strong&gt;civilisation&lt;/strong&gt;, yet I do not understand a thing! On the back of my
mind I was thinking, isn't this the same feeling of ignorance and
disconnect when foreigner looks at Chinese arts? and what about the
most recent news of &lt;a href="http://www.baike.com/wiki/%E5%A5%B6%E5%A5%B6%E5%BA%99"&gt;奶奶庙&lt;/a&gt;, that people are debating whether
these local artifacts are a form of popular art, or an example of poor
taste. So when it is an eye sore, to me, isn't it because I lack of
the context, thus, like looking at these truly marvelous of the West,
so as to being clueless of how to appreciate? Isn't &lt;em&gt;beauty&lt;/em&gt;, after
all, a complete subjective matter? But if so, how do we perceive
beauty? how do we create a &lt;em&gt;beautiful&lt;/em&gt; thing, a &lt;em&gt;beautiful&lt;/em&gt; feeling, 
a &lt;em&gt;beautiful&lt;/em&gt; act, anymore, if it is just your words against mine?
Doesn't this feel, wrong?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Interesting. I do not know. I don't think there is a qualified
&lt;em&gt;beauty&lt;/em&gt;, that someone can define, or determine, or discriminate one
form or another. Yet, there is a sense of beauty in us. You can't deny
it. There is a common beauty. There is a timelessness in them. I can't
explain, nor even give example. But it's
there. The &lt;a href="https://www.wikiwand.com/en/La_Marseillaise"&gt;La Marseillaise&lt;/a&gt; moves me everytime it is played. It's
a sensation shooting through my vein.  You want to stand up, you want
to march, you want to fight for a principle, and you can die for it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Music, painting, sculpture, literature... arts have such a power that
they can possess the receiver at the moment of engagement. How
transforming! So what about these &lt;a href="http://www.baike.com/wiki/%E5%A5%B6%E5%A5%B6%E5%BA%99"&gt;奶奶庙&lt;/a&gt; arts? Aren't they on the
equal footing as those classics since they also bring a sensation to
their audience, just on a different spectrum than mine?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;No&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But no. I still have to disagree. As liberal as I try, these &lt;em&gt;objects&lt;/em&gt;
are vulgar. Same apply to many of the modern Chinese sculptures,
statues, and buildings. To think of it, it is not these big &lt;strong&gt;mass&lt;/strong&gt;
themselves are at fault. No. There are some that are just replica of
the originals, like the &lt;a href="https://www.wikiwand.com/en/Charging_Bull"&gt;Charging Bull&lt;/a&gt;, while others are free
range vulgarity some called &lt;em&gt;creativity&lt;/em&gt;. Even when it is a truthful
copy, it looks bad. The &lt;em&gt;creative&lt;/em&gt; ones are, just alien.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Why so? I think they lost the soul, the &lt;strong&gt;genuity&lt;/strong&gt;, the spirit
within, the life, and thus become a superficial, lifeless, 
thus become a joke. The great sculptures
convey such a force, be it a smooth marble of a human head, or a
charging bull in bronze, it talks to you without holding back an inch
of the feelings that author felt and invested into it. No holding
back. It's not only all there, it wants more, it creates more, it
empowers you. Beethoven, Mozart, &lt;a href="https://www.wikiwand.com/en/La_boh%C3%A8me"&gt;La bohème&lt;/a&gt;, love letter, a great
movie, a portrait... it beholds you, it has its own identity, speaking
to you, staring at you, and disrupting you. It's a language by its own
that best describes the scene and conveys an emotion, and it does it
&lt;strong&gt;perfectly&lt;/strong&gt;. It has motion,
has a thought, has a moment, that draws you into it, so you can be
part of what it is presenting.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Those Chinese mockups, lost all of the above. You know what, this
actually is familiar &amp;mdash; they took the shell, thinking the shell
is the whole. So there is a perfect replica in form, but has no root
&amp;mdash; a charging bull by the entrance of a condo community, a
Capitol Hill  shaped county government building, or even the super
ugly &lt;a href="https://www.wikiwand.com/en/National_Centre_for_the_Performing_Arts_(China)"&gt;egg&lt;/a&gt;. I think they are all looking great, marvelous
creation; but they don't fit where they are because they have no soul.
What to fight and charge when it sits next to a bunch of cookie cutter
high-rise condos!!!????? And how it be &lt;strong&gt;restless&lt;/strong&gt; and &lt;strong&gt;resisting&lt;/strong&gt;
when the whole point of residential is about peaceful family life!???
Isn't this a joke or what!? And the performance arts in a round,
smooth, harmony looking egg!? NO! Performance arts are energy,
initiation, burst of force, searching deep in human soul, touching the
untouchable, speaking the unspeakables! How can they live with
harmony!!?... I'm angry, I'm about to cry, because they are sooooo
fake and soo lost the meaning of what the form is for... these, are
genuine insult on arts. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Diversity creates beauty (how interesting the
&lt;a href="https://www.wikiwand.com/en/Fearless_Girl"&gt;fearless girl&lt;/a&gt; is!). But fake shells can never.&lt;/p&gt;</content><category term="thoughts"></category><category term="thoughts"></category></entry><entry><title>Tencent &amp; Opium</title><link href="https://fengxia41103.github.io/myblog/tencent%20and%20opium.html" rel="alternate"></link><published>2017-08-09T09:46:00-04:00</published><updated>2017-08-09T09:46:00-04:00</updated><author><name>Feng Xia</name></author><id>tag:fengxia41103.github.io,2017-08-09:/myblog/tencent and opium.html</id><summary type="html">&lt;figure class="col l6 m6 s12"&gt;

&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Listening to &lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6DsteIjyZZs"&gt;this talk&lt;/a&gt; this morning, the thought hit me. How do
you look at this &lt;a href="https://www.wikiwand.com/en/King_of_Glory"&gt;game&lt;/a&gt;?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Games, in my humble opinion, are just, bad. I know it's unfair to say
so since I have grown out of that addiction phase, and every boy/man
will go through that sometime in their life, inevitably. I don't know
the psyche or chemistry or bio-trigger behind this phenomenon. There
must be reason, especially a chemical reason. Brain likes it not
because it feels good, because there is a chemical stuff that equals
&lt;strong&gt;feeling good&lt;/strong&gt; &amp;mdash; just the same stuff in different outfit,
&lt;em&gt;gamble = sex&lt;/em&gt; that kind of high.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But what bothers me is this. When the entire Chinese population is so
trenched in their &lt;strong&gt;moral high ground&lt;/strong&gt; through education (which
myself is a victim, too) that the recent history of humiliation
started with &lt;a href="https://www.wikiwand.com/en/Opium_Wars"&gt;the Opium War&lt;/a&gt; caused by nothing but foreign bully
and their blood-thirsty greed, don't they see the parallel of what
they are doing right now, with this game!?&lt;/p&gt;

and their blood-thirsty greed, don't they see the parallel of what
they are doing right now, with this game!?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When investors are getting a high from Tencent's big hit, how is it
different from the East Indian Company was rewarded for their 
success in selling this great stuff called &lt;a href="https://www.wikiwand.com/en/Opium"&gt;Opium&lt;/a&gt; to the
unexplored &lt;em&gt;super market&lt;/em&gt;  &amp;mdash; the Orient/the great middle kingdom
of China? It's the same in my opinion.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Because for market and investment, there is nothing about moral,
nothing about right and wrong (and who gets to define these anyway? do
you really even know what a right is? Is there even such a thing as
&lt;em&gt;being right&lt;/em&gt;?) It is all about returns, which is objective, clear
cut, and zero-emotion. As long as the market responds positively and
cash flows in, investors are happy. These same set of investors can,
at the same time, be mad at some other corporations who are doing the
&lt;strong&gt;evil&lt;/strong&gt; by ruining some other people's lives. If the suffering is
remote enough, and I do mean &lt;em&gt;remote&lt;/em&gt; being in both the geographical
sense and logic sense, it become just another news slip crossing the
screen.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is curious then. In human core, we &lt;strong&gt;do not&lt;/strong&gt; operate on facts,
at all. We operate on a set of images we believe &amp;rarr; beliefs. These
beliefs are self-fulfilling. They can be completly contradictory, yet
causing no hesitation in one's thought or behavior. We don't even
realize them in most times. We can equally defend them one way or the
other. They are just equally true.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So how do you explain feelings like &lt;em&gt;shame&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;em&gt;disappointment&lt;/em&gt;,
&lt;em&gt;regret&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;em&gt;anger&lt;/em&gt;? Aren't they then just a creation of yourself,
because they came from perceived misalignment between your belief
versus facts? If so, doesn't it mean that you then don't have a
justification to whine, to feel bad, to become angry or annoyed, or to
feel that way at all? Extending this out, doesn't it mean all
critics become pointless, because they are based on a view, and that
is just subjective and arbitrary? How do you look at history then,
such as the &lt;a href="https://www.wikiwand.com/en/Opium_Wars"&gt;Opium War&lt;/a&gt;? It is a national scar. But since their
motivation and execution back then were just as natural and logical as
what we are seeing right now with Tencent, how can one continue to
blame the war and those &lt;em&gt;barbarians&lt;/em&gt;?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;How about public opinion then? How about a popular belief that
everyone adopts, at least for now? If all these go out of the window,
how do we act? Shouldn't I still feel anything? If they are all just
my own wishful thinking, why can't I change a view and viola, all the
bad stuff are just disappear? In other words, why can't I &lt;strong&gt;fool&lt;/strong&gt;
myself all of the time? If I could, then isn't it really becoming a
Matrix world, in which no one is living; they are merely experiencing
a virtual blank. How scary is that!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I don't know. This one seems to raise more questions than it
answers. I was meant to criticize the Tencent fans for their
paradox. But then, what am I to &lt;em&gt;judge&lt;/em&gt;? The paradox is valid; but I
could not explain, nor have a solution. I feel it is so universally
true that it's even false to point it out as I am doing (I think I'm
doing).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;These days, everywhere you turn, there is talk about AI, and one
primary theme is the human fear of being replaced by robots, thus
resulting in huge waves of layoffs and job loss, which then leads to
social turmoils, revolutions, and government collapses. Horrible.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But if you think of it, it isn't new. Not only it isn't new, I think
it is one of those topics that is &lt;strong&gt;perpetual true&lt;/strong&gt; and &lt;strong&gt;perpetually
horrible&lt;/strong&gt;, whenever you bring it up. Like a nightmare, the only way
to deal with it, is to wake up (in other words, not to think of
it). As long as you put yourself into that scene, man, it's certainly
gonna be bad.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Exaggerated? Just take a step back and name all the parallels you can
think of &amp;mdash; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;when there is a more efficient way in production &amp;rarr; job loss&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;when there is a new way in production &amp;rarr; job loss&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;when an innovation emerges that takes the fantasy of everybody
   &amp;rarr; job loss&lt;/li&gt;

   &amp;rarr; job loss&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I think you get the idea. The theme is the same, that the old way of
doing things are bound to be changed, and with that change, many
positions will be eliminated, and people lose their old jobs because
&lt;strong&gt;they are not needed anymore&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So in the core, the fear is about not feeling needed anymore, an
abandonment if you will, by the society. Isn't this the same as being
abandoned by love? I have always been thinking that if only one knows
where the next relationship is, the agony of breaking up wouldn't be
that hard at all. Borrowing from the Hunger Game, &lt;em&gt;the only thing that
is more powerful than fear, is hope&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I recall the book of &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/Affluent-Society-John-Kenneth-Galbraith/dp/0395925002"&gt;The Affluent Society&lt;/a&gt;, which argues that with
the prosperity of America, many will be rendered &lt;strong&gt;idle&lt;/strong&gt; because high
production efficiency simply doesn't need that many labor. The author
said this new class, the &lt;strong&gt;ideal class&lt;/strong&gt;, is not only natural, but
actually good, so might as well embrace it instead of fighting it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Doesn't it sound the same arguments we are hearing about AI? Yes, I
think so. That's why I say this topic isn't new, and is going to be
repeated over and over and over. Different trigger, same talk.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;Your job, isn't ready&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Then I was thinking, what type of jobs will be eliminated? The
immediate reaction will be &amp;mdash; low skill jobs. They can be easily
replaced by machine power, can't they? &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But, what if, your job, isn't ready!?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Robots/computers aren't monsters who just eat everything on its way
and still digest well. They pick; they have an appetite of certain
things, but not all.  So the question becomes, what do they like?
They like logic, reasoning, and deterministic result; their stomach
doesn't do well if you feed them &lt;strong&gt;ambiguity&lt;/strong&gt;. What are these about?
Not sheer machine power, your arms vs. his hydraulics. It's about
&lt;strong&gt;decision making&lt;/strong&gt; (in today's glorified term, it's about &lt;strong&gt;intelligence&lt;/strong&gt;).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In any computerized application, there is an
inherent decision making process, which is derived from offline domain
knowledge. Computer is really brainless, actually. Unless you tell it
there is a decision to be made, and these are the &lt;code&gt;if-else&lt;/code&gt; you need
to make your decisions based on, it has no idea. So who knows there is
a decision point, and here are the 4-5 options, and condition to pick
one over another? &amp;mdash; someone who possessed this domain
knowledge, be it from experience, from business requirement, from
management needs, from a genius stroke &amp;mdash; they are all
&lt;strong&gt;offline&lt;/strong&gt; and &lt;strong&gt;domain specific&lt;/strong&gt;. &lt;span class="myhighlight"&gt;
Computer can model, implement,
and enforce them; but it can't invent them&lt;/span&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So what type of jobs are ready to be, &lt;strong&gt;computerized&lt;/strong&gt;? Corporate
jobs, because they are usually better defined (what to do), better
structured (how to do it), better documented (models), better
understood (explicit domain knowledge), and often repetitive (wow, 
this is paradise for computers). To replace a guy shoveling a
sidewalk, his labor can be easily done by a robot, but his pattern of
shoveling and his experience of digging here versus there because of
the difference of soil or his tool, if there is any, well, 
nobody has ever spend time
to extract that &lt;strong&gt;domain knowledge&lt;/strong&gt;, therefore computer is
&lt;strong&gt;clueless&lt;/strong&gt; about him, therefore, his job is just not READY!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The fundamental law here is the cliche that &lt;strong&gt;there is no free
lunch&lt;/strong&gt;. Extracting that domain knowledge and modeling it into a
computer bears a cost (cost of someone else to understand you, and you
willing to open up your &lt;em&gt;secrets&lt;/em&gt;), and that cost does not justify
someone to study and figure out how a robot can do that shoveling
job. Human labor, as long as it is cheaper than this cost, is plainly
safe, for economic reason.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So, as long as your job sucks to a degree that it is boring, making
only reasonable profits, and disgusts many people, your job is safe.
Of course, here lies the other extreme of the spectrum, that the job
is challenging to the point that human simply doesn't know how to

&lt;p&gt;Watching the &lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wR6SFLhD32Q&amp;amp;list=PLJA4Jys7jT0LR-Ze9Joi2OHsC6_BbY-Hp"&gt;Civilisaiton&lt;/a&gt; Youtube, what a fantastic topic and
description of western civilisation! This is quite interesting
especially with the backdrop of Jared
Diamond's &lt;a href="https://www.wikiwand.com/en/Guns,_Germs,_and_Steel"&gt;Guns, Germs, and Steel&lt;/a&gt;, which I found it godly
convincing as I was first introduced to think about the history of
human civilisation through his &lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i885hopsw6E"&gt;documentary&lt;/a&gt;.
However, the two views of what gave birth and energy to the rise and
fall of a civilisation are quite, different, though both are
intriguing and far beyond my scope of knowledge and even
imagination. Nonetheless, there is one thing suddenly came to me, and
I think it's a topic worth writing about.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What is it?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In all the videos, literature, thinking, and theory of the
indisputable advance of the western civilisation, there are plenty
episodes and text devoted to the dark side of the western history
&amp;mdash; slavery, the conquest of South America, war with the native
Indians... there were pure cruelty, absolutely inhumane deeds, against
animal, against nature, against another human being. It makes your

&lt;p&gt;Watching the &lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wR6SFLhD32Q&amp;amp;list=PLJA4Jys7jT0LR-Ze9Joi2OHsC6_BbY-Hp"&gt;Civilisaiton&lt;/a&gt; Youtube, what a fantastic topic and

I think it's a topic worth writing about.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In all the videos, literature, thinking, and theory of the
indisputable advance of the western civilisation, there are plenty
episodes and text devoted to the dark side of the western history
&amp;mdash; slavery, the conquest of South America, war with the native
Indians... there were pure cruelty, absolutely inhumane deeds, against
animal, against nature, against another human being. It makes your
heart shaken; if there were God, he must have been on vacation then.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So even though the conclusion and the way to state those years are
one-sided (as I have not seen a black host in the program), the sheer
act to illustrate  what happened, to ask why that was so, to question what
impact it made to the advance of society and the deterrence of
progress, to feel shamed about the horror winners imposed upon the
losers, to caution that history isn't just a mirror of ourselves, it
is a prophecy, is encouraging.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On the contrast, I asked myself, &lt;strong&gt;what literature or anything I
have been taught in school or heard in today's forum touches upon the
same theme of China's own history&lt;/strong&gt;!? I could think of none. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yes, there are programs on history, and I have quite enjoyed some of
them. But even in those which I really liked, I hardly sensed an eye
of scrutiny that not only picked up all the romance and wonder, but
also the human cost lay behind those pride. Yes, I know there is
censorship that made authors and hosts no choice but to turn their
head to one side, only. But that doesn't explain it. Really, among
nearly all talks and shows, I haven't heard a single voice who digs
into the vast, pride history of boasted 5,000 years of this enormous
oriental civilisation, and ask, "How did other races living in China
these days lose the race to the dominant汉?"&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You know, these days one thing that constantly makes me mad is the
popular opinion that all population except those of the middle earth
were backwards, and were only saved by China's advanced philosophy,
culture, and technology. They paid contribute out of a pure admiration
and respect; no bully, no trickery, no fuss.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;How could that be!!!? No way. If we truly believe the length of our
history, then think about it, 5000 years! That's an unimaginable
length of time that no one has ever experienced (cause we all die &amp;lt;
100, most of us). Stop cheery picking a few moments in the history and
say "Look! See how wonderful we have treated them!" Excuse me? The
country could only have gained this mass of land through
force. Period. Even for the US, it bought land from France and Mexico
because, well, they showed enough force to take them whether the
seller was willing to sell or not. So if you still believe in a tale
of angel stroke a deal for the two parties in which one party traded
an abstract called &lt;strong&gt;culture&lt;/strong&gt; (or arts, poems, philosophy, anything
that is paperware) while the other trades land, then you live in the
world of the Matrix. Neil, wake up.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So this lack of self-reflection, the constant finger pointing to
invaders who caused ALL the misery for any setbacks, is perfectly
consistent with what I witnessed in today's China &amp;mdash;
irresponsible from top government all the way to the street vendor.
&lt;span class="myhighlight"&gt;Of course, how could one do anything bad, if
his ancestor has been kind to everyone come to his path for 5000
years!?&lt;/span&gt; We always showered them with kindness and wisdom, but
look at what they brought in return?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This, is just utterly absurd!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To learn, we know review is a must; to do better next time, no
professor can beat your own mistakes and errors. Apply to a person,
apply to a country, apply to a society, apply to a civilisation.
So next time when someone brags about the rise the new China, let's
not use GDP or the 13 billion people for index. &lt;strong&gt;How about the number of
documentaries and books, like &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/Civilisation-Complete-Kenneth-Clark/dp/B000F0UUKA"&gt;this one&lt;/a&gt;, for a change (of mindset)?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</content><category term="thoughts"></category><category term="thoughts"></category></entry><entry><title>Marketing</title><link href="https://fengxia41103.github.io/myblog/marketing.html" rel="alternate"></link><published>2017-07-30T08:12:00-04:00</published><updated>2017-07-30T08:12:00-04:00</updated><author><name>Feng Xia</name></author><id>tag:fengxia41103.github.io,2017-07-30:/myblog/marketing.html</id><summary type="html">&lt;p&gt;Man wasn't that annoying!

outlet yesterday, and the language it used annoyed the shxxt out of
me. Let me explain why.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;Total attention&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The content is actually fine. There is a total sum of &lt;code&gt;attention&lt;/code&gt;
consumers can provide:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;code&gt;total consumer attention&lt;/code&gt; = &lt;code&gt;num_of_consumer&lt;/code&gt; x &lt;code&gt;16 hr/day&lt;/code&gt; x &lt;code&gt;365
days/yr&lt;/code&gt; x &lt;code&gt;adjustment %&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So in essence this term is equivalent to a percentage of &lt;code&gt;total time&lt;/code&gt;
a consumer spends on a particular message, which corresponds to what I
have always been saying that the only dimension immune to any
manipulation and variables (by far) is &lt;span
class="myhighlight"&gt;time&lt;/span&gt; &amp;mdash; it is a continuously flow
forward. No one can stop it; no one can shorten it or expand it; and
nothing can ignore it. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So far, so good. Then the talk starts a deep dive into what he thinks
the successful stories of marketing by quoting history of certain
marketing and strategies, and that's when it started to annoy me,
badly.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;Grand labeling&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So far, so good. Then the talk starts a deep dive into what he thinks
the successful stories of marketing by quoting history of certain
marketing and strategies, and that's when it started to annoy me,
badly.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;Grand labeling&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;First, the term &lt;code&gt;祖师爷&lt;/code&gt;. What does it mean? This is such a common
term used by the Chinese as if everybody has agreed upon its
definition. Here is &lt;a href="https://baike.baidu.com/item/%E7%A5%96%E5%B8%88%E7%88%B7"&gt;one&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;某种技艺的发明创造者。&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;对一行业的形成，有过重大贡献的人。&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;某位历史名人，曾做过某种行业。&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;某为神灵与某一行业有关。&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But you see, when you want to make a statement that &lt;em&gt;a marketing
strategy is not new&lt;/em&gt;, you can use a supportive evidence by tracing back in
time to find an older instance of it. But then labeling that instance
to &lt;code&gt;祖师爷&lt;/code&gt; (and the talk is filled with this term, 祖师爷this, 祖师爷
that..), no! Where is the proof that he invented the strategy? or to
prove that his practice of the trade &lt;strong&gt;contributed significantly&lt;/strong&gt; to
the development of this line of business? Since words like
&lt;code&gt;significantly&lt;/code&gt; must be &lt;span class="myhighlight"&gt;relative&lt;/span&gt;, the
argument has to be provide a reference, sth like &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Before his time, the work was done in such a such way, and it was
less effective... comparing to his new method....&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Something like that. Otherwise, that's just a &lt;strong&gt;single instance&lt;/strong&gt; you
mentioned and then quickly labeled with a &lt;em&gt;good looking&lt;/em&gt; word &lt;code&gt;祖师爷&lt;/code&gt; as if this is self-justified! But you see, that's exactly the
problem of today's Chinese expression &amp;mdash; because it lacks the
depth of research, or lacks the willingness to convey knowledge, it
falls back to use these terms &lt;strong&gt;liberally&lt;/strong&gt; as a window dresser so to
make it impressive, but actually vague at best, and completly false
at worst!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is cheating. This can easily becomes a lie. A grand label doesn't
make your message any more true than it is. Period. But sadly, it can
fool some of the people some of the time.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;Propaganda&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now comes the worst part. First, let me make this clear, whoever
thinks of marketing as being dressed up every moment (night and day)
and party party, you shouldn't do this business, at all.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Marketing/advertising is neither flashy nor noble. It itself is not
&lt;code&gt;高大上&lt;/code&gt;, because it's a line of business that, like everyone else,
takes a lot of research, hard work, and discipline to be successful. I
think the underline image of a marketer being always the one standing
the spot light making some grand announcement to his audience (yes,
and the talk inevitably used Hitler as an example of such image) is
just wrong by itself! &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;No, I'm not against using Hitler in this context
&amp;mdash; he certainly had his way to launch propaganda and influence
his audience. But his being the tag of this horrifying episode of
human history was not rooted in his charm or his voice or his
marketing strategy. No. The event has a deeply rooted historical context
traced way back beyond the defeat of the WWI. So to me, German or
Europe was to have a war with or without Hitler. Someone
was bound to play that role. If the talker ever reads some history of
WWII and of Hitler, the sentiment of &lt;a href="https://www.wikiwand.com/en/Antisemitism"&gt;antisemitism&lt;/a&gt; was not a
creation of Nazi as many (particular my fellow Chinese) have falsely
thought.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So one thing the talk got it right, is that propaganda is a weapon of
massive destruction, and that's exactly why &lt;span class="myhighlight"&gt;
I'm totally totally against any social propaganda led by the all
mighty government regardless how wonderful the message may be and how
wonderful the outcome in the future may be&lt;/span&gt;. Whatever it is
advertising might lead everyone to paradise; but the means to achieve
it, the way the message is communicated, can be seamlessly used to
lead everyone to hell, because fundamentally such practice silents
independent thinking and voice, and that is the worst one can do to
himself, both in the scale of a society and in the scale of an
individual.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;Creating needs&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;figure class="col l6 m6 s12"&gt;
  &lt;img src="images/funny/direct%20marketing.jpg"/&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;IMHO, the talk completly misled audience to think that marketing and
advertising is to manipulate consumer's mind so to make them believe
they have a need. The example of &lt;a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/health/archive/2014/02/misunderstanding-orange-juice-as-a-health-drink/283579/"&gt;orange juice&lt;/a&gt; is just
terrible. It was true; but it is also true that marketer was nothing
but the executor of a business desire driven by an industry, not the
inventor. &lt;span class="myhighlight"&gt;Everyone has this idea &amp;mdash; to
sell you something, I need to create a belief in you to feel good
about having it. So just like any idea on this earth, ideas are cheap,
the execution is the hard part&lt;/span&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And when you talk about &lt;strong&gt;belief&lt;/strong&gt;, well, there are only two ways to
achieve that &amp;mdash; propaganda (so you are soaked in a mono-tone
message), or censorship. The end result is the same, that you are
insulated from alternatives and different opinions, well, if yourself
don't think! The public image of creditable people 
such as doctors and &lt;strong&gt;experts&lt;/strong&gt; just to shape your view before you
have one yourself. But don't you see how evil this practice is!!?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;No. Marketing and advertisement should not be this way. It started
to bridge the gap between seller and buyer, where buyer already has a
need and seller is providing the service. Yes, new needs are
constantly evolving, shifting, marketing and advertising are
researchers who discover them, not creating them. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you examine any of the examples quoted in this talk, you will
realize any of the created-needs came from a human desire far deep
than what marketer can influence &amp;mdash; how about health? Yes, all
the diet product, orange juice story, Q-10.. it's all about human
wants to stay healthy. Period. It's the branch that grows these
leaves, not the other way around.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So when the talk is making it sound marketing has invented these
needs (and is the success story for all future marketers to follow), I
could not disagree more! Stop thinking marketing is to be &lt;em&gt;super
being&lt;/em&gt; who can form this world! That's the path leads to another
dictator!! Instead, your mission is to have a deep insight of the
human desire (psychology) and society (social study), and be the
sensor of what is going on at this moment in this country, in this
society, in this world.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Evil politics want to control your mind and tell you what you like and
dislike; marketer and advertisement should not be. They can become one
only when you yourself let them. So pls do me a favor, don't.&lt;/p&gt;</content><category term="thoughts"></category><category term="thoughts"></category></entry><entry><title>Luck</title><link href="https://fengxia41103.github.io/myblog/luck.html" rel="alternate"></link><published>2017-07-29T07:34:00-04:00</published><updated>2017-07-29T07:34:00-04:00</updated><author><name>Feng Xia</name></author><id>tag:fengxia41103.github.io,2017-07-29:/myblog/luck.html</id><summary type="html">&lt;figure class="col l4 m6 s12"&gt;
  &lt;img src="images/luck.jpg"/&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I was listening to this &lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2g_JFGnJMW4&amp;amp;t=1519s"&gt;talk&lt;/a&gt; on Youtube about luck, and that got
me thinking.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It's a cliche when people talk about luck, and someone gets lucky, or
unlucky. It feels it is something we have no control over, and it is
just randomly happened, for good and for bad. It is an easy
&lt;strong&gt;execuse&lt;/strong&gt; to make an unhappy reality tolerable, and a fortune
justifiable. But in the end, no one can explain what brought that luck
&amp;mdash; granted, there have always been many theories on its coming,
but the fundamental attribute of luck is that it is not predictable!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That's right. I suddenly realized what a luck is &amp;mdash; &lt;span
class="myhighlight"&gt;Luck only exists in a rear view
mirror&lt;/span&gt;. There is no such thing as &lt;strong&gt;forward looking&lt;/strong&gt; luck, or
&lt;strong&gt;future&lt;/strong&gt; luck, or &lt;strong&gt;you will get lucky&lt;/strong&gt;, because the truth is, you
don't know until it has happened and you already experienced the
result, whatever it may be, pleasant or horrible.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So why can't luck be something we can control, produce, maybe with a
lot of effort, but at …&lt;/p&gt;</summary><content type="html">&lt;figure class="col l4 m6 s12"&gt;
  &lt;img src="images/luck.jpg"/&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I was listening to this &lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2g_JFGnJMW4&amp;amp;t=1519s"&gt;talk&lt;/a&gt; on Youtube about luck, and that got

don't know until it has happened and you already experienced the
result, whatever it may be, pleasant or horrible.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So why can't luck be something we can control, produce, maybe with a
lot of effort, but at least there is a hope? No. What the word &lt;code&gt;luck&lt;/code&gt;
has become is actually a baggage of variables that can ONLY
exist in the past, and they  &lt;span
class="myhighlight"&gt;may&lt;/span&gt; have contributed to the final
result. But there are two problems we simply do not have a method yet, nor
a capacity, to make this reverse engineering effort possible:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;How do we know how many variables are there that &lt;strong&gt;contributed&lt;/strong&gt; to
this result? Literally there are infinite number of them, and each
plays a role in the final showdown. If you think of it, the mere
existence of you and me is an accumulated miracle over that many
seconds of pure coincidence since birth to this very moment that I'm
typing and you are reading.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;It is easy to come up with a correlation between a &lt;em&gt;significant&lt;/em&gt;
   variable (we think) to the result. But too often one confuses
   correlation with &lt;strong&gt;causal&lt;/strong&gt; relationship, and mistakenly took the
   former as the accepted answer. No! Correlation is by definition
   looking in the rear view mirror! It &lt;span class="myhighlight"&gt; can
   not, will not, should not, and absolutely must not&lt;/span&gt;, be used
   to produce a deterministic next. There is no such a logic. 
   Therefore, luck can only be &lt;strong&gt;explained&lt;/strong&gt; and
   &lt;strong&gt;theorized&lt;/strong&gt;, but not (yet) known beforehand.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But I got curious. So often we say &lt;em&gt;good luck&lt;/em&gt; with a sincere heart;
we believe in religion and pray for miracles; we, everyone of us, get
&lt;em&gt;lucky&lt;/em&gt; sometimes. It's a wonderful feeling. Are we powerless in
mastering our own destiny in this sense? Can we influence its
trajectory through something like hard work, training, discipline,
faith, diet, high spirit, good looking, fortune? After all, there are
just so many things we don't like about our current existence &amp;mdash;
the result of a series of &lt;em&gt;bad lucks&lt;/em&gt;, and we all wish to change our
luck, to graze the grass on the other hill because they look greener.
We constantly fight this desire for a better luck through painfully
self-reminder that we should be happy with what we already have, and
we label all those thoughts of wanting a change as &lt;strong&gt;desire&lt;/strong&gt;,
&lt;strong&gt;greed&lt;/strong&gt;, &lt;strong&gt;immuture&lt;/strong&gt;, &lt;strong&gt;做&lt;/strong&gt;, which all convey a negative feeling
that put us to shame. But if the urge of having a better luck
isn't part of us, why doesn't it just go away? why did it
come up even? This is strange, isn't it?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So if luck is a summary of all the past, I think the computer model is
actually pretty simple. We have a function, &lt;code&gt;result = f(var1, var2,
var3......)&lt;/code&gt;, and if only we could count in all the variables, and
have enough samples to test this function. So far we can't have all
the variables yet, because it feels &lt;strong&gt;everything&lt;/strong&gt; is related &amp;mdash;
didn't turn right at a cross 10 years ago, well, it eventually leads
to me being still alive, today!  How far fetched it seems! but then,
how true it is!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Life itself is an accumulated decisions, and the funny thing is that
we think some carry more weight than others, but the reality is that
they are all the same! No one has a crystal ball, and no one can turn
back the clock, so decision is a one way street. Therefore, what you
choose today makes no difference whatsoever because there is no
reference! You make a decision, then you move on. Whatever comes out
of life, is the &lt;code&gt;result=f(decision 1, decision 2, .... decison
N)&lt;/code&gt;. Since we don't have a book writing down for each decision we made
and linking them to what came out it after, we already lost track of
this record, which in turn makes analysis &lt;strong&gt;impossible&lt;/strong&gt;. So when
people say &lt;strong&gt;luck&lt;/strong&gt;, it is really nothing but a cherry-picked set of
variables one decides to use to support his/her statement, nothing
more than that!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Therefore, luck, is really in the domain of subjective emotion than
objective reality. The irony, however, lies when someone believes his
success is not due to luck, but some deterministic methodology that
can be replicated and re-iterated. That's pure BS. Just say you are
lucky and move on &amp;mdash; saying "oh I was just lucky" is a polite way
to acknowledge the ignorance, which is the only truth. Seriously, can
you write me this list of variables that are &lt;strong&gt;sufficient&lt;/strong&gt; to
generate the same result!? If you can not, you are just, lucky.  Just
don't fool yourself (and many audience, unfortunately) that you have a
recipe. You can have a &lt;em&gt;theory&lt;/em&gt;, however, and it's up to others to try
that if they will. But selling your design of success is a lie.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There you have it. Luck, only exists in the past.  It's a
representation of subjectively picked variables to establish a
correlation between the past and a result. So in this sense, you can
&lt;strong&gt;always feel lucky, and be lucky&lt;/strong&gt;, if you want to.&lt;/p&gt;</content><category term="thoughts"></category><category term="thoughts"></category></entry><entry><title>Math, the decline of the US</title><link href="https://fengxia41103.github.io/myblog/is%20math%20important.html" rel="alternate"></link><published>2017-07-21T20:30:00-04:00</published><updated>2017-07-21T20:30:00-04:00</updated><author><name>Feng Xia</name></author><id>tag:fengxia41103.github.io,2017-07-21:/myblog/is math important.html</id><summary type="html">&lt;p&gt;Came across an &lt;a href="https://www.zhihu.com/question/20953633"&gt;article&lt;/a&gt; tonight.

country does. Even any person wishes having some talents. Good
education, of course. So if the US is losing its charm, and these
smart people stop coming to the US, who can pick up the torch to
continue pushing the boundary of technology?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You know what. One thing I can be sure is that today's China is not
ready. Technology is a tool, and will always be a tool. The
description of a problem, is what matters.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;Question matters&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;figure class="col l4 m6 s12"&gt;
  &lt;img src="images/funny/image008.gif"/&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Think about how you acquire knowledge. Google search engine knows
practically EVERYTHING. The quality of learning isn't about how much
a knowledge database like Google knows, but how well you can form your
question &amp;mdash; garbage in, garbage out. The quality of the question
really stands for how well you have understood the question/problem
itself, and how detailed your work is. If you ask "Google, how much is
1+1?", you get a pin-point answer, exact, precise; if you ask "Google,
what is an addition?" You get a lengthy answer that looks really
complex, cool, but too general to be acted on; if you ask "Google, how
is integer addition done in binary format?" There is clear definition
of &lt;strong&gt;integer&lt;/strong&gt;, &lt;strong&gt;binary&lt;/strong&gt;, and &lt;strong&gt;addition&lt;/strong&gt;. You get the picture.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;How to get clarity then? Challenge, debate, argue, fight,
trial-and-error, and iterate. US is constructed to not only tolerate,
but encourage such activities. Think of attorneys who is seeking every
opportunity to arouse a class action; the hedge funds who prays for a
company, good or bad, to make a mistake; the community townhall
meetings that your neighbour complains your 2nd floor balcony invades
her privacy because she enjoys walking in her house naked with
curtains up for some sunshine... not to mention "what does that mean?"
heard everywhere, all the time... &lt;span class="myhighlight"&gt; this is a
shout-out for definition, for clarity, for ruling out ambiguity, for
exploring pros and cons as much as one's mind can carry, for scrapping
every dark corner with an open eye and a magnifier, and this, is what
can finally leads to a good question to ask, and only then it can lead
to the answer&lt;/span&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This, is how technology evolves; this, is why US is holding the
torch. US can fail, and it probably will fail someday anyway. Country,
is like a human, can't stay young and healthy 24x7 forever; it gets
sick, it falls, it may even die. But whoever is 2nd in line must carry
the same spirit because that is the only way &amp;mdash; clarify your
definition!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;Math matters&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So let's talk about math. What is the math? It's not about knowing
&lt;code&gt;1+1=2&lt;/code&gt;. It is a form of definition that is clear, precise,
deterministic. So the math education, or education in general, isn't
about how to solve a particular function; it's a clear description of
a problem, thus the question. Once the question is defined, the
solution becomes possible, and useful.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Therefore, it becomes completly irrelevant when this type of
articles are comparing how complex a 3rd grade math is. It is not the
knowledge that matters; it is the thinking process that matters. &lt;span
class="myhighlight"&gt; Knowledge in today's world is nothing but fonts
printed on paper.&lt;/span&gt; Literally, one can find ALL what human knows
about in Google and Amazon books. Period. But forming and defining
the question remains to be a formidable challenge.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So regardless how US students are poop at math, they will come out on
top as long as they learned the principle of what math really is
&amp;mdash; define your question precisely.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;Corrupted language&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I have talked about China's &lt;a href="https://fengxia41103.github.io/myblog/irresponsible response.html"&gt;irresponsible response&lt;/a&gt;. That's
exactly why I think it currently stands no chance in technology
frontier. Today Chinese language is &lt;strong&gt;corrupted&lt;/strong&gt;. People are proud of
using fuzzy terms as if they show sophistication. They even brag that
this is the beauty of this language. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;False! Chinese classic literature is exactly the opposite. It was
concise, precise, and accurate. It was a &lt;strong&gt;clear definition&lt;/strong&gt; of the
things it was describing. The best user of this language were the ones
who have formed a description of the question without any
ambiguity. It is hardly up for interpretation; it is the exact moment
and thought that the author was meant to deliver, even hundreds later,
still clear, crispy and lively. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So, when Chinese developers, their design documents, their
response to clients, their requirements stop using the terms such as
&lt;code&gt;某种程度&lt;/code&gt;(to some degree), &lt;code&gt;或许&lt;/code&gt;（probably）, &lt;code&gt;等等&lt;/code&gt;(and so on), I
will say their math education is now working.&lt;/p&gt;</content><category term="thoughts"></category><category term="thoughts"></category></entry><entry><title>Data, Integrity</title><link href="https://fengxia41103.github.io/myblog/data%20and%20credit%20score.html" rel="alternate"></link><published>2017-07-12T20:30:00-04:00</published><updated>2017-07-12T20:30:00-04:00</updated><author><name>Feng Xia</name></author><id>tag:fengxia41103.github.io,2017-07-12:/myblog/data and credit score.html</id><summary type="html">&lt;p&gt;The first time reading &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/Trust-Social-Virtues-Creation-Prosperity/dp/0684825252"&gt;"Trust"&lt;/a&gt; by &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Francis_Fukuyama"&gt;Francis Fukuyama&lt;/a&gt;, I was

&lt;p&gt;The concept is very enticing. This score, like what we have in the US,
will hinder you from doing bad things, breaking laws, defaulting
loans, dodging tax, and even being on welfare for too long &amp;mdash; it
is a force to stop your sin and encourage your virtue. You are
rewarded for your good, and punished for you bad. Common sense.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But China, what a magical land, just possess this infinite creativity to
turn anything upside down. If 取其精华，去其糟粕
is a wisdom of how to learn new things, in practice the "smart"
Chinese is doing the exact opposite. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When I grew up in the 80s and early 90s, the main stream was filled
with news and articles and classroom materials that were nearly 100%
qualitative with little quantitative analysis to back up
their statements. Legend from the dark age of the 60s and 70s was that
data was manufactured &lt;strong&gt;on demand&lt;/strong&gt; to serve a purpose, often
political, therefore reflected little reality. Trained as an engineer
and a believer in &lt;em&gt;science&lt;/em&gt;, I found it ridiculous and felt sad about
ppl who had to live with those lies.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So things got really better in the past 10 years. Everywhere you turn,
there is data, charts, Excel, application... and then the buzz &amp;mdash;
big data, data this, data that... if you can not include the word "data"
in your sentence, you are just out, out of fashion, out of mind, and
out of a trustworthy circle. What a turn! But that's exactly the part
that annoys me.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When you speak of data, when everything is data-driven, when any
argument is now backed by some table, curve, statistics, when no data
is too big and everyone thinks data holds the magic to solve &lt;strong&gt;any&lt;/strong&gt;
problem, do they know that this is the golden age of going digital,
but the worse time for &lt;strong&gt;trust&lt;/strong&gt;!? I read an article today that
Alibaba installed a &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sesame_Credit"&gt;Sasame credit&lt;/a&gt; as a hope to lead the way to
introduce credit score in everyone's life. However, you can pay some
total stranger $70 to get a perfect score using his/her manufactured
data (maybe someone else's data, who knows). &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;Data integrity&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This isn't even ironic. This is fucked up. Most common reaction I
believe is that things will be different if government is running this
instead of a private commercial entity. And I'll argue that not only
it will not make a difference, but it will be a terrible idea. Who is
supervising the government!? Why is it trustworthy, at all!? What
happens when it installs some BS like this &lt;a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/chinas-new-tool-for-social-control-a-credit-rating-for-everything-1480351590"&gt;social credit score&lt;/a&gt;
with probably all the noble intention, but in the end became a lawless
tool in government's hand to crush whoever it feels like!? Tell me,
how to prevent that from happening besides praying for its
conscience!? Come on.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But my point isn't about politics at all. The root cause of this is
not some bad apples who want to outsmart the system to make profit. It
will always happen. It's human nature. The problem, is &lt;span
class="myhighlgiht"&gt;people fail to understand data itself means
nothing, absolutely nothing, if it loses integrity&lt;/span&gt;. The credit
score itself is the icing; the way to collect, process, cross-check to
verify and validate these data, is the core that creates "trust".&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When clients want to build a system, the only principle he needs to
understand is &lt;strong&gt;garbage in, garbage out&lt;/strong&gt;. System is not smart. Data
is not smart. Data generator, whoever that is, is smart. The power of a
system is not at accumulating data; it's the ability to &lt;span
class="myhighlight"&gt;define and guard&lt;/span&gt; data integrity. Period.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;How to achieve that? Defining integrity is the job of human. It is
domain specific and context sensitive. The analogy is that user agrees
1 plus 1 equals 2. Then data's job is make sure everywhere there is 1
plus 1, it flags it green if it equals 2, and flags red otherwise. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;Trust, but verify&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;How to guard integrity? Cross checking. I love President Reagan's
&lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trust,_but_verify"&gt;trust, but verify&lt;/a&gt;. How do you know your data is correct? Looking
at them in multiple dimensions see if the result is
&lt;strong&gt;consistent&lt;/strong&gt;. Remember, garbage in, garbage out. This is literally a
mental race between the system implementor and data manipulators. The
cheapest, and also the most effective, way is to feed you garbage at
the first place, and that's what's happening to this Seseame score.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So my complaint is that people pick up an idea or a buzz word without
looking further to its assumption, and rush to market it as if it's
another silver bullet. The assumption is really what matters. For
credit score, or any other data driven application/idea/concept, the
data integrity is the assumption. It takes tremendous insight into the
subject at hand, and a lot of disciplines to verify. Then and only
then, it can create trust.&lt;/p&gt;</content><category term="thoughts"></category><category term="thoughts"></category></entry><entry><title>Can you innovate?</title><link href="https://fengxia41103.github.io/myblog/can%20you%20innovate.html" rel="alternate"></link><published>2017-07-07T21:21:00-04:00</published><updated>2017-07-07T21:21:00-04:00</updated><author><name>Feng Xia</name></author><id>tag:fengxia41103.github.io,2017-07-07:/myblog/can you innovate.html</id><summary type="html">&lt;p&gt;This has been a topic on my mind for quite some time now ever since I

&lt;figure class="col l6 m6 s12"&gt;
  &lt;img src="images/funny/startup.jpg"/&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;First, loading buzz words is not innovation.  These days just walking
into any coffee shop in Shanghai and locate any group of:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;more than 2 people (2 is more likely love birds chatting), &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;age band between 20-40&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;using laptop instead of smart phone or tablet&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;bonus: it's running a PPT&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;super bonus: it's running code&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yes, you have just found &lt;span class="myhighlight"&gt; Latte
entrepreneurs&lt;/span&gt;(love this name/&lt;a href="https://www.peterjthomson.com/latte-entrepreneur/"&gt;ref&lt;/a&gt;). Get a cup of coffee and
eavesdrop for a while, the buzz words are bound to flow in full
strength: &lt;code&gt;cloud computing&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code&gt;big data&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code&gt;sharing economy&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code&gt;amazon&lt;/code&gt;,
&lt;code&gt;google&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code&gt;BAT&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code&gt;R&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code&gt;AI&lt;/code&gt;...  Whatever the problem is, or even the
solution might be, these are the most common denominators.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I really shouldn't bash these ppl. After all they are thinking, and
trying to create a solution. But I was deeply annoyed because &amp;mdash;
often than not they were using these words &lt;span class="myhighlight"&gt;as
if they were a magic potion&lt;/span&gt;! Just drink it and your problem is
solved. No! Their conversation barely scratched the surface of these
technologies (which I highly suspect it is because they don't
understand much of them, let alone first hand experience with them)
and rarely you hear a voice cautioning about implication, downside,
assumption and risk. But everybody knows that there is &lt;span
class="myhighlight"&gt;free lunch&lt;/span&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Let's say &lt;em&gt;cloud computing&lt;/em&gt;. Why cloud? what make a cloud? Yes
there is the &lt;a href="http://nvlpubs.nist.gov/nistpubs/Legacy/SP/nistspecialpublication800-145.pdf"&gt;NIST definition&lt;/a&gt;, but that doesn't really mean
anything to me if you can't relate it to your own context (the problem
we are to solve) and explain (clearly):&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;what will a cloud be used for&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;how it is going to help&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;which layer is going to help, and&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;how that decision was made&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To the minimum, if you are thinking that building a cloud is more of a
HW investment than SW, then you don't know what you are talking
about. If you are to rent from services like AWS, 
then can you tell me &lt;span class="myhighlight"&gt;what challenge you 
are most likely to run into&lt;/span&gt; (and I can tell you now it is
not just money... no, not data security, nor privacy, nor vendor lock
in... these are all valid points, but the real bummer, is the learning
curve). &lt;span class="myhighlight"&gt;Yes, people, brain&lt;/span&gt;.  That
will be the hardest asset to come by, and the most valuable in your
org. AWS is a wonderful service. It is a Ferrari with a million
dials. The magic word &lt;em&gt;cloud computing&lt;/em&gt; is not going to just spit out
a solution for you. It will help, dramatically, if you know how to
tune those dials.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Man! I can't tell you how many times I had to battle
some Chinese IT fella in 2015 who wanted to sell his client
an Oracle database (the swiss army knife of DB) but
failed to come up a single example which feature of the Oracle is
needed in his application, and why alternatives are inferior? Come
on! if you are too lazy or just not good enough to set up an
apple-to-apple evaluation, then all what you are saying about the
wonderful things of Oracle, are just a word-of-mouth speculation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;Domain silo&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The reason they took the buzz words as solution itself is that they
are taking an easy way out &amp;mdash; a sounded cure-fore-all instead of
acquiring, analyzing and proving &lt;strong&gt;domain knowledge&lt;/strong&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;How much do you really know the problem?  and the context of the
   problem?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;What's the assumption you are taking to think of this as a problem?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;What method you used to analyze the cause of this problem?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;How do you support your argument? and how sound is your support,
   both qualitatively and quantitatively?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My problem is that many conversations I have participated all went
with roughly 30-min of problem discussion then went right into
the grand future of the "what if we get 10% of the
13-billion population using this!?" How exciting! &lt;span
class="myhighlight"&gt;Of course, even selling a million toilet paper is
an exciting business, and if you can figure out to sell them by the
piece instead of roll, man, you will be a legend for sure&lt;/span&gt;.
This is not innovation talk; this is a group opium high.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Analyzing something is hard. As a matter of fact, any learning is
hard. To understand the problem is the hardest part, if not the only
thing it matters in an innovation. Most of us possess domain knowledge
of some sort. The quick measure I would suggest is how much time you
have spent in that domain. Time doesn't cheat, and practice does make
one perfect. So even with a domain expert onboard, the process of
knowledge sharing so the software guy can &lt;span
class="myhighlight"&gt;internalize&lt;/span&gt; the idea and in turn transform
it into his domain expertise, eg. a software model and code, and
transfer his thinking back to the team for verification and discussion
&amp;mdash; this back-and-forth process not only takes time, but is a
steep learning on both sides. Most importantly, &lt;span
class="myhighlight"&gt;it takes both sides' willingness to learn&lt;/span&gt;
in order to work.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So for innovation, it's really a process of learning A LOT OF things
which you have little knowledge before, and each must contribute to
the pod with his/her sharing. Some of those will be easy to pick up;
others, will be frustratingly difficult. If it takes 3 years for a
highschool and a 4 years for a college, this &lt;em&gt;mega-million-dollar big
problem&lt;/em&gt; you are trying to solve can't be easier than those.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Well, now look around, how many team members are excited about
learning some coding, or accounting?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;Stop IT me&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If there is one theme of the buzz word section, it is
the dominant relevancy of IT. Yes, software is everywhere; coding is a
must have. But then, how many times I saw the poor coder sitting on
the side the table, listening in silence, as if the idea flows one way
&amp;mdash; from business owner to IT implementation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In China, coders and their managers must have a love-hate
relatinoship. They are needed (somehow), but nobody wants to pay him
much. Even worse, nobody understands him. He lives without a style and
is bad at speech; his jokes are dry; his need is not much; his skill
is witch-like, from fixing an iPhone to writing an app, even sometimes
a WORD or PPT; and &lt;span class="myhighlight"&gt; the best of all, there
are a dime of dozen of them&lt;/span&gt; in job market and by subway exit;
whatever their coding language is, they can all do the same thing, and
with the same quality, too &amp;mdash; &lt;strong&gt;poor&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is really bizzare. Writing software is hard; writing quality one
is really really really hard. By common sense you won't look at anyone
speaking English to be a novelist, let alone a Shakespeare. But that's
exactly the mentality these innovation teams or their investors
have. So with such thoughts, on the one hand coders are necessity but
certainly not a worthy &lt;em&gt;investment&lt;/em&gt;, on the other hand coders lack proper
mentorship in work to learn, develop and mature, so their deliveries
proved the common bias &amp;mdash; "Look, this is scrappy
produce/code... I'm totally overpaying you..." sad, sad, sad.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Chinese management and team setup are so used to the hierarchy they
grow up with in school, in their previous jobs, and in the society
overall, that this is the only format they know. But innovation, as we
have argued, is depending on knowledge sharing, cross training, and
mutual interest in each other's domain. Hierarchy not only makes
information flow in one direction only, but enforces domain silo and
ignorance which enpowers the seemingly superior position (mgt? founder? investor?)
to legitimize its ignorance &amp;mdash; "Hey look, IT guy, I hired you
because I don't know IT...".&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So how to fix this? Stop using the word "IT"! It's an enormous topic
under this umbrella that each consists of a technology that can be
extremely challenging. If you are an IT guy, do you know &lt;code&gt;database&lt;/code&gt;?
how about &lt;code&gt;nosql&lt;/code&gt;? and deployment? and performance tuning? clustering?
modeling?  driver?... and network? server? storage?
virtualization?... So to make things straight, &lt;span
class="myhighlight"&gt;stop IT me&lt;/span&gt;. Let IT's voice be part of the
contribution, not just a downstream magic pod that will turn idea into
reality. Let everyone be &lt;span class="myhighlight"&gt;practical&lt;/span&gt; 
and &lt;span class="myhighlight"&gt;specific&lt;/span&gt; in term of their domain &amp;mdash; yes
I know something about Python and Django web framework; no, I don't
know much about database, networking and storage. Same goes for HR,
for business analyst, for product owner, for investor, and for everone
who takes innovation seriously. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;Disruptive, not&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;figure class="col l6 m6 s12"&gt;
  &lt;img src="images/funny/disruptive.jpg"/&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A byproduct of China's economy miracle is an impatience to realize a
dream. Even worse, urban legends encourage one to be &lt;em&gt;disruptive&lt;/em&gt;,
because, just look around, how many new riches found their fortune by
disrupting the traditional course with their ignorance and ego alone!
The mentality of &lt;em&gt;nothing is impossible&lt;/em&gt; is not a slogan, it's a
common sense.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But no, innovation is not, and can not be, disruptive. We have argued
innovation is rooted in domain knowledge, and that knowledge forms the
food chain we see today, which in turn brew the perceived problem. The
instinct of redrawing the map to remove that problem is absolutely
correct &amp;mdash; it's like taking fish out of its tank. It will
die. But the new map will have its own quirks, just you haven't seen
them yet. &lt;span class="myhighlight"&gt;So being disruptive in that sense
is nothing but replacing the old, visible problems with a promise
while repeating "no problem no problem no problem..." to your covered
ears&lt;/span&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Innovation is not magic. It can only be a system with feedback loop
that can be continuously tuned. Like writing software, you always
started with a version 1, and ended up with version 989287429 after
that many iterations of trial-and-error. If you ignore (or downplay)
the intermediates, viola, your end result looks absolutely
&lt;strong&gt;innovative&lt;/strong&gt;!  Think about Newton's apple, or Einstein's, or Google,
or Amazon, great arts, or any disruptive technology/solution you have
in mind, just look closer, read and research, you will find
breadcrumbs all over its path. The last push gets all the glory, but
the truth is that it's standing on the shoulder of a giant, and the
ladder to climb is the &lt;span class="myhighlight"&gt;spirals of continuous try-measure-tune-repeat&lt;/span&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;Innovating&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yes I'm a tech guy and am on a &lt;em&gt;perpetual&lt;/em&gt; learning curve of some new
or unfamiliar technologies. With a growing age, I found myself even
constantly on a review session of some old technologies &amp;mdash; a
command line I can't think of anymore after a couple month, a Python
syntax that now eludes me and I have to google it &amp;mdash; this is not
even stackoverflow because SO is used only when I can ask a (smart)
question that has passed Python 101. I'm talking about &lt;em&gt;google python
built-in function&lt;/em&gt; type of basics. Shame. But there are just so many
pieces one needs to know in order to build a technology stack.  So to
me I'm constantly learning, constantly thinking, constantly
re-inventing wheels or copying someone else's wheels, and constantly
writing something &lt;strong&gt;new&lt;/strong&gt; and &lt;strong&gt;fresh&lt;/strong&gt; that only my brain is
producing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Those last part, if being original and bearing a thought worth
talking about, is my solute to innovation.&lt;/p&gt;</content><category term="thoughts"></category><category term="thoughts"></category></entry><entry><title>AI</title><link href="https://fengxia41103.github.io/myblog/ai.html" rel="alternate"></link><published>2017-06-05T07:21:00-04:00</published><updated>2017-06-05T07:21:00-04:00</updated><author><name>Feng Xia</name></author><id>tag:fengxia41103.github.io,2017-06-05:/myblog/ai.html</id><summary type="html">&lt;figure class="col l6 m6 s12"&gt;

&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I have pretty low tolerance of BS. The hot topic of AI bothers me
a great deal, because it is being discussed by too many ppl who have no
context. It is becoming just another buzz word rolling off your tongue
to make you sound sophisticated and smart. But no, AI is neither
magic nor intimidating. I think it is a great example for human being
to looking at things with a straight face, cut to the core, no more
BS, no more hand waving and using some abstract, ideological fuzziness
to fool ppl.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At least 20 years ago I have read a line about artificial
intelligence, which cleared formed my view on this &amp;mdash; There are
two ways to define &lt;strong&gt;intelligence&lt;/strong&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Machine emulate human's train of thoughts, and derives
   the same conclusion.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Machine ignores your human brain, finds its own way, and
   arrive the same conclusion.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The key is, &lt;span class="myhighlight"&gt;the final result is the
same&lt;/span&gt;. So how can you distinguish the difference? does process
even matter? If we both doing math, &lt;code&gt;4 x 8&lt;/code&gt;, human …&lt;/p&gt;</summary><content type="html">&lt;figure class="col l6 m6 s12"&gt;

even matter? If we both doing math, &lt;code&gt;4 x 8&lt;/code&gt;, human uses
&lt;strong&gt;multiplication&lt;/strong&gt;, you know what? computers know nothing about
multiplications, to it, everything is an &lt;code&gt;add&lt;/code&gt;, period. It will add
these numbers that many times, but much much much faster than any human can
do. For human, single digit has shortcuts, double digit
multiplications takes a paper and pen, and when you are
talking about a 12737-digit number multiplying another 28787-digit
number, forget it. Computer is going to win, hands down, 
every, single, time. You know why?
because to computer, &lt;code&gt;4x8&lt;/code&gt; is the same as &lt;code&gt;29837497972 x 980987574009&lt;/code&gt;,
same method, same logic, repetitive of the same action.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That's the beauty of it, isn't it? If you just look at this example
closely, you will start to realize this isn't even a need for debate
&amp;mdash; the core of multiplication, or the true concept of
multiplication, is addition. So putting the same lens over Alpha Go
and its recently victories over all top players, I think it is exactly
because the computer implementation of Go cuts down the BS around this
game, which was used to be thought being an art of Zen, so
philosophical, so hard to master, hard to comprehend, and the players
are all god like beings. Well, here it is, computer engineers, as
being a group of dumb and unsophisticated and simple-minded beings,
looked at this game and said to themselves:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"What is this empror wearing?"&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And this same line of story has been playing all over the human
history. In speed, in energy, in any physical strength arena, we human
have already accepted defeat. The only cover left for our pride is the
so called &lt;strong&gt;intelligence&lt;/strong&gt;, and losing this is making us feel
uncomfortable. This is unnecessary at all. Just because no one has
ever been able to decipher and define &lt;span
class="myhighlight"&gt;clearly&lt;/span&gt; what human intelligence is, it
doesn't mean we are superior to machine. I actually think this
progress in defeating the Go game is a wonderful lesson for human, for
anyone who likes and enjoys to wrap themselves around with mystery so
to feel good. &lt;span class="myhighlight"&gt;If the empror is naked, so he
is&lt;/span&gt;.  If it looks great but no one can explain, it is nothing
but a willingness to make yourself believe in.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Alpha Go, just like addition vs. multiplication, gets us one step
closer to what the core of Go is, after thousands of years of zen-ing
of self-addiction. This is not only a feat of computer engineering and
so called deep learning or AI or whatever fancy words you know, this
is a &lt;strong&gt;giant leap&lt;/strong&gt; for Go itself &amp;mdash; machine is a challenger, a
pile of cold-blooded emotionless solid-state electronics, a kid who
shouted out "Look he is, naked!" Multiplication is a must in math
concept, it has its use in many many ways. When machine derives the
same answer by brute-force addition, it is not cheating, it is not
&lt;strong&gt;intelligent&lt;/strong&gt; either. It is merely anchoring the truth of that
concept so human don't forget.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Human intelligence, AI, same deal, no one is superior to the
other. There is difference in efficiency, and there is difference in
how objective one versus another. If someone loses his game, not
because the machine is smarter, but because the group of ppl behind
those machines are not satisfied with the given answer, and wanted to
think deeper of inherited &lt;strong&gt;truth&lt;/strong&gt;.  Computer, just like any other
mechanics and electronics human invented, are just tools to make the
work more efficient. Tools don't crack the code, we do; computer
doesn't make decisions, the writer of that &lt;code&gt;if-else&lt;/code&gt; line do.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="highlight"&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class="c1"&gt;# FACT: is he naked&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="k"&gt;if&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;have_clothes_on&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="n"&gt;naked&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="kc"&gt;False&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="k"&gt;else&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="n"&gt;naked&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="kc"&gt;True&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class="c1"&gt;# OPINION: does he look good&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="k"&gt;if&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;i_like_it&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="n"&gt;looking_good&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="kc"&gt;True&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="k"&gt;else&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="n"&gt;looking_good&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="kc"&gt;False&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Here, computer identifies two variables representing two completly
different dimensions. This is just my simplified view of the world
when looking at the empror. If you mixed the two in your head, wow,
it's a Dao, a Zen, a culture, a you-can-only-feel-it abstract, and
that is when you start saying "how wonderful his new gown looks!"&lt;/p&gt;</content><category term="thoughts"></category><category term="thoughts"></category></entry><entry><title>Love till past</title><link href="https://fengxia41103.github.io/myblog/love%20till%20past.html" rel="alternate"></link><published>2017-06-03T08:20:00-04:00</published><updated>2017-06-03T08:20:00-04:00</updated><author><name>Feng Xia</name></author><id>tag:fengxia41103.github.io,2017-06-03:/myblog/love till past.html</id><summary type="html">&lt;figure class="col l6 m6 s12"&gt;

&lt;p&gt;很多人都i知道，浪漫的爱情里，两个人都怕时间太短，都说要长相守，两不忘。
最浪漫的话，是陪你慢慢变老。 Then this morning I had another
thought. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;All families have some burdens that trouble them, regardless how
wealthy they are, how wonderful they look to outsiders, how much love
they have for each other. There just
isn't one single, perfectly happy, worry-free, trouble-free,
conflict-free family. But then, with dad's current condition, he
doesn't understand these troubles anymore. What used to be a
forbidden topic can now be safely said in front of him &amp;mdash;
grantedly he has his own world these days and that world isn't worry
free either. However, he is not bothered by the worries that is
troubling me.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So I was thinking, the most romantic thing is not to accompany you
till age, but &lt;span class="myhighlight"&gt;to be with you till you don't
remember the past anymore.&lt;/span&gt; 是的，就是这样的 …&lt;/p&gt;</summary><content type="html">&lt;figure class="col l6 m6 s12"&gt;

不是从前的故事了，是另一段回忆里生长出来的世界，那个世界里，依然有
两个人，也是一半的幸福，一半的忧伤，那就真是陪着了，不变老，也不忘记。&lt;/p&gt;</content><category term="thoughts"></category><category term="love"></category></entry><entry><title>Teahouse</title><link href="https://fengxia41103.github.io/myblog/teahouse.html" rel="alternate"></link><published>2017-06-02T10:00:00-04:00</published><updated>2017-06-02T10:00:00-04:00</updated><author><name>Feng Xia</name></author><id>tag:fengxia41103.github.io,2017-06-02:/myblog/teahouse.html</id><summary type="html">&lt;figure class="col l6 m6 s12"&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is an interesting thought. I am listening to this talk show about
三里屯, and guests are discussing the come and go of bars in this
place. For those who don't know this place, it's a section in BJ that
has a lot of bars which aggregated young ppl and foreigners.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What's interesting of the topic is when a guest mentioned about bars
in Europe, for example, that had its good days and bad days. Yet it's
still there after 30, 40 years. The owner is now a middle age man
instead of a young fella, and the place is still running, even with a
taste of similar food, similar decoration, a few more photos that ppl
can recognize the link between then and now, a trace of heritage.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Doesn't this description remind you the well-known play, &lt;a href="https://zh.wikipedia.org/wiki/茶馆_(话剧)"&gt;Teahouse 茶

lost, disrupted, changed. In the play, the teahouse was passed down
from generation to generation, business as usual, ppl all know each
other, and time seemed stopped. Then, it all went down when the war
started, the era changed, the ppl fought to survive, and the ugly and
the beauty went upside down. What makes me think now is, isn't it a
sign of maturity and stability, thus an overall prosperity for the
society, that the existence of such a lasting heritage represents? But
then, isn't change inevitable so it's fruitless to fight against it?
Isn't stopping the clock a scare?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I don't know. People in change are longing for stability; people in
stability are longing for a change. This applies to marriage, to jobs,
to a life style, to even a dress code and a fashion. What do we want

&lt;p&gt;This is interesting. I am at the nursing home eating, and suddenly
realized the color of the book cover that I'm reading is nearly
identical to the color of the food containers. You know what? I have never
noticed this color before, nor would ever thought I will give it a
second thought. But then looking up, there it is, again, lying around
me, without me ever seeing it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What is this color? &lt;span style="color:#F6CEF5"&gt;#F6CEF5&lt;/span&gt; is the
closest my eyes can tell. But men are known to be insensitive to
colors. So I'm not sure how accurate this number reflects what I saw.
I have thought this color really &lt;strong&gt;cheezy&lt;/strong&gt;, but it speaks to me in a
way like never before, and I couldn't help wondering that your life is
marked by various ppl with their leftovers, some left a smile, some
left a sadness, some a regret, some a long lost friendship, some a
music, and another a color.&lt;/p&gt;

second thought. But then looking up, there it is, again, lying around
me, without me ever seeing it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What is this color? &lt;span style="color:#F6CEF5"&gt;#F6CEF5&lt;/span&gt; is the
closest my eyes can tell. But men are known to be insensitive to
colors. So I'm not sure how accurate this number reflects what I saw.
I have thought this color really &lt;strong&gt;cheezy&lt;/strong&gt;, but it speaks to me in a
way like never before, and I couldn't help wondering that your life is
marked by various ppl with their leftovers, some left a smile, some
left a sadness, some a regret, some a long lost friendship, some a
music, and another a color.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I know there is color theory that some are matching with others which
please the eyes while other combinations don't. Then there is the cold
color vs. hot color, blue for depression and red for passion. What is
this color? What does it stand for? I can't even think of a physical
thing that is in this color, yet it is here, everywhere. It reminds me
icecream, but it isn't cold or cool or sugary. It feels, mixed,
confused, puzzled. I thought it was pink, but is it also purple?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If colors arouse certain emotion, what we feel everyday while walking
on the street? Is the brain even processing or capable of processing
all these colors? I always find the SH streets too noisy for my
tastes, not just the crowd, the noise, the constant fluctuation of
ppl, all kinds of ordinary and strange activities, and then, here they
are, overwhelming display of colors &amp;mdash; from clothes, from
billboards, from everybody walking towards you and everyone passing
you by.  The old depressing time was marked by three dominant colors
&amp;mdash; white, black and gray. No one wanted that back. But now have
you thought we have &lt;strong&gt;too many&lt;/strong&gt; colors? is there such a thing as too
many colors? what does it feel like? why does it mean to us?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This purple-ish pink &lt;code&gt;#f6cef5&lt;/code&gt;, so it walked into my life, stayed.&lt;/p&gt;</content><category term="thoughts"></category><category term="thoughts"></category></entry><entry><title>Zebra line</title><link href="https://fengxia41103.github.io/myblog/zebra%20line.html" rel="alternate"></link><published>2017-05-31T19:45:00-04:00</published><updated>2017-05-31T19:45:00-04:00</updated><author><name>Feng Xia</name></author><id>tag:fengxia41103.github.io,2017-05-31:/myblog/zebra line.html</id><summary type="html">&lt;figure class="col l6 m6 s12"&gt;

&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Walking on the street in SH, I just realized what is wrong with this
place. So I was walking across this giant intersection, and I do mean
&lt;strong&gt;giant&lt;/strong&gt; because everytime I had to put in the high gear and used my
dash speed at the first moment the walking sign turned green in order
to &lt;strong&gt;barely&lt;/strong&gt; make to the other side, provides there were many
cars making their right turn and cut me off in the middle of the
intersection. Let's put this way, to walk across these modern looking
six-lane intersection is a matter of courage, full mindness of being
ready to die, or fight, and a secret pray that the drivers will let
you pass, or the guy next to you will block the hit for you.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This doesn't sound good. So SH puts out an army of &lt;strong&gt;social workers&lt;/strong&gt; on
the street to manage these intersections. They can be spotted with
uniform and often a flag in hand. I was just starting the dash when
the uniform turned to me and clearly …&lt;/p&gt;</summary><content type="html">&lt;figure class="col l6 m6 s12"&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This doesn't sound good. So SH puts out an army of &lt;strong&gt;social workers&lt;/strong&gt; on
the street to manage these intersections. They can be spotted with
uniform and often a flag in hand. I was just starting the dash when
the uniform turned to me and clearly warned me to use the zebra
line. The zebra line is a good 20 steps away from where I was, and
with the cutting throat of count down I have with the walking sign,
that's a lot to afford. Well, well, being a good citizen of nobody, I
moved towards the zebra line.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Then all of sudden, it came to me. That's it! This is what is wrong
with zebra line. Everbody knows the line is meant to protect the
pedestrians. But watch, the cars turning to this direction were making
the right without slowing down a bit!  A few approached cautiously
were not gonna stop either. They were reluctantly brought to a halt
because a few brave souls in front of me walked on with a spirit of
"you stop or dare you I have a gun". So if the cars were not observing pedestrians on
the zebra line, what's the point of asking us to use it, and take it
one step further, what is the point of having the line at all!? To me,
it felt almost like aggregating all the dispersed pedestrians onto the
lines so the drivers have an easy time to aim and fire in batch mode.
Or maybe the line provides camouflage of some sort that does make me
invisible, or invincible, or maybe a special power to battle the
upcoming steel. Well well, that's quite an imaginative wish, isn't it?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class="myhighlight"&gt;Zebra line is really a form a social
contract &lt;/span&gt;. Like any other contract, both parties enter the deal
must hold their ends in order for the contract to work. If any drops
the ball, the other one will have no incentive to (and should not)
observe the contract anymore, and that's exactly what is going on with
these zebra lines. What's the point of asking me to step on the zebra
line when nothing is stopping those cars?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Instead, let's cancel the turn-right signal while there is a walking
sign on. No more opportunist. When I walk, all cars that can cut in
the zebra lines get red light, period. Until drivers learn to give
pedestrians a safety zone, they pay the price in form of longer wait for their
ignorance and arrogance. Oh, and please make the walk timer longer. If
the city is troubled by ever growing number of cars which made these
&lt;strong&gt;giant&lt;/strong&gt; intersections necessary, pedestrians should be encouraged,
not defeated.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Is this why we don't have Beatles in China?&lt;/p&gt;</content><category term="thoughts"></category><category term="thoughts"></category></entry><entry><title>Sound of silence</title><link href="https://fengxia41103.github.io/myblog/sound%20of%20silence.html" rel="alternate"></link><published>2017-05-31T07:45:00-04:00</published><updated>2017-05-31T07:45:00-04:00</updated><author><name>Feng Xia</name></author><id>tag:fengxia41103.github.io,2017-05-31:/myblog/sound of silence.html</id><summary type="html">&lt;figure class="col l4 m4 s12"&gt;

&lt;p&gt;What is everybody looking for? Identity? I see people in the middle of
the social rung are all searching for something. Waking up this
morning and walking on the street, the place was certainly busier
after the holiday, more ppl, more cars, more purpose. Do ppl at the
bottom of the rung bother with a purpose in life? and if you look at
the social spectrum, can I say there are only two ppl who are probably
not bothered by this question &amp;mdash; the two at each extreme of the
spectrum, then everyone else fall into the &lt;strong&gt;middle&lt;/strong&gt;, so called
middle class? But I don't believe the richest of the rich is anxiety
free either. He has his own problems, just that I don't know. It's too
far away form the life I know of that the problem is keenly true to
him, but irrelevant to me. Well, almost so, until by the pattern of
history, his trouble and his struggle will flow into my life at some
point and make my life uncomfortable, too. But …&lt;/p&gt;</summary><content type="html">&lt;figure class="col l4 m4 s12"&gt;

history, his trouble and his struggle will flow into my life at some
point and make my life uncomfortable, too. But that's like Nth degree
of indirection.  So as far as I'm concerned, his trouble stays in his
life, and I get mine.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I know everybody is looking for something. The most recent thought I
have is that people are looking for an image of themselves, someone
that they want to be, living the life they want to have.  I can't say
she is searching for the meaning of life. Life can be quite
&lt;strong&gt;meaningless&lt;/strong&gt;. After all it's a subjective judgement &amp;mdash; yours
vs. mine. Your life might be wonderfully exciting, to you, but quite
meaningless, to me. So what is this image or life that everybody is
looking for? I know everyone has a different opinion. But why two ppl
will fall in love? Do they have a similar &lt;span
class="myhighlight"&gt;image of life&lt;/span&gt; in mind? At the moment of
romance they certainly thought they do. But how come the images always
become further apart after a while, even after they have been living
together for a while, sometimes a long time? Did their images change?
Why didn't they stay in sync? You would think that after they went
through many things in common in their lives, they would now share
more and more of the same projections of being, which I suppose should
bring them closer and closer. But no. More likely they find each
other's pitfalls that doesn't fit with the image, and the initial
thought of similarity became conflict, and they walk apart, live
apart, love apart. How sad. But why?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I have been watching young lovers sitting at food table, while one of
them would pull out the iphone (or whatever) and.. and there is no
&lt;strong&gt;and&lt;/strong&gt;. The person isn't really doing much actually. She (pardon me,
let me use "she" for the convenience of writing) will scroll, scroll,
chat, chat, flip from screen to screen, click an icon to launch an
app, shut it down after maybe 10 secs, flip, flip, click another icon,
launch back the chat, no message, switch..... that's really boring!
and she is really bored! And the guy would be on his phone, playing
games? chatting with friends? or doing same boring finger dance? &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I don't get it. When two ppl spending time together at breakfast or
dinner, it's a commitment to me, that I'm willing to spend these
minutes of my life, with you. I have so much to say, to comment, to
share with you, just watch the ppl coming in and out this place,
aren't they fascinating? The girl standing at the corner has a
wonderful legs. The guy ordering food has obnoxious attitude, and he
didn't bathe before leaving home this morning, how can any girl want
to touch or kiss him? but then his wife (or gf, or whatever) has a
nice dress, and they have a baby! How could that be? Doesn't the woman
deserve someone, better? but she looks, satisfied, and bored?  And I
like watching you, with your fine hair, your eyes sparkling with you,
the only sparkle you can have, and how wonderful this is.... there are
just sooooo much to talk about, to go around, to spend this time,
together, truly, together, not just two well-known-to-each-other
strangers each owns a fancy mobile phone. &lt;strong&gt;For God sake anyone can own
a phone like that if s/he chooses so, but not everyone can spend the
time with her, with him, with you&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I heard the sign of lost love and lost passion is when two have
nothing to talk about. &lt;span class="myhighlight"&gt;How sad, the sound of
silence.&lt;/span&gt; Not that there isn't all the interesting things
around, they are still there. But you mentally shutdown and are not
willing to open up your mind anymore. Why? Because the other person
doesn't agree with you? and the conversation turns into an argument
which you don't want to repeat for the thousandth time? what about the
image of yourself now? What is the image you have in mind? someone who
is looking for an applause, a supporter, a fan? If so, isn't it rather
childish to think that way? or is it? Doesn't everybody wants to be
agreed upon, especially by the one who is the closest? wait, didn't
that person become the closest to you because s/he used to agree with
you, all the time? So what you are truly looking for is the sense of
recognition then. Is it replaceable by something else other than the
person sitting next to you? Why s/he carries so much weight and you
are so eager to get his/her approval? What if one day s/he challenges
you? will you feel abandoned? is that how breakup works?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Too many questions, zero answer. It's ok. One thing I know is that
time is the most precious gift one can give. Time is given to
everyone, but no one can make more. If I spend these seconds with you,
that's what I want to have, want to have you in my life, want to have
the memory of you in my life, want to take over the many seconds of
your life too. My life becomes shorter, so is yours, and we both give
a few seconds of ourselves, to each other. Isn't it better than any
gift or present or handbags or roses or whatever?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you still love, even just yourself, give the piece of your life to
that person, whose hand you just held, whose night you just spent
with, whose skin you just touched, whose name you just said, whose
smell you just can't forget, whose will to share that segment of
memory with you, fully. Don't busy yourself with the boring phone,
really. If you have the power to revert time or wipe it clean
afterwards, your time is actually more than what I can imagine. But
for now, if you are a walking body with all the fits and emotions and
desires like I have, please, look at him, look at her, how wonderful
that is, that this human being, also chose to have you, in memory, in
life, in time.&lt;/p&gt;</content><category term="thoughts"></category><category term="love"></category></entry><entry><title>Girl's love</title><link href="https://fengxia41103.github.io/myblog/girl%20love.html" rel="alternate"></link><published>2017-05-29T21:00:00-04:00</published><updated>2017-05-29T21:00:00-04:00</updated><author><name>Feng Xia</name></author><id>tag:fengxia41103.github.io,2017-05-29:/myblog/girl love.html</id><summary type="html">&lt;figure class="col l4 m4 s12"&gt;

&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Watching all the little kids running around at this public square in
a summer evening, I was thinking to myself, "boy, that's a lot of kids. And
each one of them came from a man and a woman, and they had to have sex
at some point to make this happen, and that moment was supposed to be
a time they were so attracted to each other and trusted each other
that especially the woman was willing to bear the seed so to make this
baby." But then looking at the couples around the kids, I couldn't
help wondering how could the guy be attractive to the girl, and vice
versa. I mean, many of them don't look that match. But somehow, the
woman liked the guy, and the guy liked the woman. Well, I suppose
there was love, or there is love, at least at the moment of the
sex.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So if I look at the guys (and most of the women), they are not that
attractive at all. Especially for the guys, many …&lt;/p&gt;</summary><content type="html">&lt;figure class="col l4 m4 s12"&gt;

woman liked the guy, and the guy liked the woman. Well, I suppose
there was love, or there is love, at least at the moment of the
sex.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So if I look at the guys (and most of the women), they are not that
attractive at all. Especially for the guys, many of them look really
crappy, no athletic build, no manly atmosphere, no intelligence in the
eyes, staring at his mobile phone like a zombie, nearly indifferent to
his wife and his kid(s), and no interest to the activities around
him. The women are slightly better. But many of them dressed poorly,
too, I should say dressed with a poor (strange) taste to my eyes. And
they usually sit with their mom who played the role of a
babysitter. I couldn't sense the passion between the two people
anymore, they don't touch, they don't hold hands, they don't walk side
by side, they don't necessarily talk. They hang out together, stroll
together, usually with at least one of them married to the stupid
smart phone. Isn't this sad!?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;However, the women didn't look sad. They looked quite content. So they
are satisfied with the setup, the husband, the kid, the life? I
couldn't tell. One thing strikes me is that since they accepted the
guy to bear a child, the guy &lt;strong&gt;was&lt;/strong&gt; quite acceptable. Therefore, the
urban legend and social trend of women having trouble to find a mate
really has nothing to do with girls being picky then. Girls are not
picky, and these running kids are the running proofs. The picky girls
are themselves choosing to stay away from these guys because the guys
don't have the qualities they are looking for. I think these are the
smart ones, really, because if you ever pay a slightest attention to
these guys, they really don't have much to offer, well, besides his
bio organ and his billion sperms.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I don't know. I'm confused. I don't know these people so I shouldn't
judge a book by its cover. The guys might be a sweet lover and a
romantic angel and a sex machine and a millionaire and... and the
woman might be a simple-minded female whose ideal is to have a family,
a kid, a husband on paper or who smoke or spit on the floor or eating
with &lt;strong&gt;pia pia&lt;/strong&gt; sound or a crappy observation of life or .... I don't
know. They liked each other, that's what matters. Now they have kids,
and they are still together. Isn't this reality better than any of my
imagined happy life? Isn't it just the happy life I am imagining and
longing to have? This is truly confusing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The legend has that girls are beautiful, delicate, and always trying
to pick the best out of all guys she has. They are wonderful beings
that deserve all the care, attention and love to cherish them. So guys
continuously strive to become his best so not to disappoint his
girl. However, watching all these kids around, I couldn't help feeling
that girls are not aiming high at all. On the contrary they aim pretty
low, and they are willing to have a kid with a guy without any of
these legendary attachments involved. She has a passionate night, gets
a baby, then settles with the guy regardless of all her so called
&lt;strong&gt;standards&lt;/strong&gt;. They are irrelevant now. And whoever get her at the
moment, becomes the lucky guy.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Is this how girls love? If so, this is really really really sad.&lt;/p&gt;</content><category term="thoughts"></category><category term="thoughts"></category></entry><entry><title>Irresponsible response</title><link href="https://fengxia41103.github.io/myblog/irresponsible%20response.html" rel="alternate"></link><published>2017-05-28T08:00:00-04:00</published><updated>2017-05-28T08:00:00-04:00</updated><author><name>Feng Xia</name></author><id>tag:fengxia41103.github.io,2017-05-28:/myblog/irresponsible response.html</id><summary type="html">&lt;figure class="col l6 m6 s12"&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Doesn't the title sound like a tongue twister? That's where the irony
is. How can you make a response &lt;strong&gt;irresponsible&lt;/strong&gt;? and what does it
give? Any harm done? Does it matter? What does it mean when it
happens? Why do ppl give such response? and why would ppl accept them?
or do they?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;The play&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The whole thing started one morning when I was sitting in this noodle
shop eating breakfast. A woman walked in and ordered a fried dish. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Cashier girl: This dish needs wait.&lt;br&gt;
Woman: Oh, how long would that be?&lt;br&gt;
Cashier girl: They just started cooking them.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The conversation ended there. Strange! well, at least to my ears, this
is really really strange, and frustrating, and maddening, and is the
root cause of everything that you don't like about this society, this
country, this life. Really.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The woman was certainly not satisfied with the response. However, she
didn't pursue. Obviously she asked the question because she wanted to

didn't pursue. Obviously she asked the question because she wanted to
decide whether she wanted to wait for this dish (if wait time is
acceptable to her) or switch do a different one. The cashier girl,
however, was completly content with her response and felt nothing was
wrong with the conversation. As a matter of fact, this so called &lt;span
class="myhighlight"&gt;chinese ambiguity&lt;/span&gt; is highly praised,
sometimes, by ppl who genuinely feel that's the art of the Chinese
language, the Chinese culture, the Chinese way. Well, you know what?
That's totally BS.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Because if you think of the root of a question, you don't ask a
question like this for pleasure and to kill time. With the context of
the scene, apparently the question was information seeking so that the
woman can make a decisioin &amp;mdash; wait for this, or not. We have all
learned in 2nd grade (or experience with learning another language)
what is the &lt;strong&gt;proper&lt;/strong&gt; way to answer a question. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Q&lt;/strong&gt;: Does the train leave at 5?&lt;br&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;A&lt;/strong&gt;: No, the train is running late. It will probably leave at 5:10.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But the cashier girl's answer, on the other hand, convey &lt;span
class="myhighlight"&gt;zero&lt;/span&gt; information to help the decision
making. Instead, she not only dodged the bullet, but throw the ball
back to the woman and put her brain on a spin now:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Woman: If it just started, how long does it usually take? Five
minutes? Maybe I can wait. But what if it takes longer than that, I
could instead get the other one, then I'll be home sooner so I can
feed my cats. They must be hungry by now. But I wanted a taste of
this dish, if only it won't take too long.....&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;The pattern&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;figure class="col l4 m4 s12"&gt;
  &lt;img src="images/funny/blame.jpg"/&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;By the end of the day, she still doesn't know how long she will wait,
and she could only make her move based on what I call &lt;span
class="myhighlight"&gt;blind assumption&lt;/span&gt;. Doesn't this phrase sound
familiar? Yes, 拍脑袋做决定. So many times at work Chinese clients and
colleagues complained about authority making decisions without having
a good understanding of the problem, and the decisions then led to the
misery that they were suffering from &amp;mdash; failures of the project, poor
quality of the product, and disrespect by management against their
profession.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But have they ever taken a step back and ask themselves, have they
given the response like the cashier girl's? In a recent project,
the company canceled a project after months of effort. I asked the
Chinese colleague for a clue, and the answer was that marketing and
sales actually voiced against this project at the very beginning, but
the R&amp;amp;D in US &lt;strong&gt;didn't get the implied message&lt;/strong&gt;. So the marketing and
sales threw up their hands in the air, just like that girl &amp;mdash; I
warned you, so whatever you end up with is not my responsibility
anymore. To make the explanation sound sophisticated, they added
that "you know, it's the Chinese way. We can understand the message
well, but they didn't get it." How wonderful. It's cultural, it's
language, it's you, silly.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is exactly the same pattern, isn't it?  So why didn't she give
the straight answer? After all, she is the one who works there so she
was in position to estimate an average wait time better than anyone
random customer. And even more ironic was that she started the warning
that "you need to wait for this dish", but then shunned the
question. Why?  One word, &lt;span
class="myhighlight"&gt;responsibility&lt;/span&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The warning&lt;/strong&gt; was not raised to help the customer. Instead, it
   was habitually said to offload responsibility &amp;mdash; I have warned
   you, therefore any negative result was not my problem anymore. How
   witty but totally disgusting!?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The answer&lt;/strong&gt;. Needless to say, she made a superficial response
   without even addressing the face value of the question. Service?
   what service? They always say &lt;strong&gt;putting yourself in customer's
   shoes&lt;/strong&gt;. That's what service is about.  A service orientated spirit
   will make her actively &lt;strong&gt;anticipate&lt;/strong&gt; customer's underline anxiety
   &amp;larr; She was apparently on a hurry. Why so? How long would she be
   willing to wait? Could I recommend something else to help her
   situation? &amp;rarr; you see, this will lead to many follow up questions,
   if she was there to &lt;span class="myhighlight"&gt;serve&lt;/span&gt;
   the customer, not just being a human cash register.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To me, the bare minimum she could have said was &lt;strong&gt;I don't know. Chef
would know that.&lt;/strong&gt; and if taking one step further, she could ask the
chef on behalf.  Well, she didn't do any of these because this
requires a few more rounds of interaction, an information seeking on
behalf the customer, and taking a responsibility of the message said:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Cashier girl: They just started cooking. It usually takes 5-6
minutes. You can also try our xyz which also tastes good and is
ready now.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;The courage&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yes, making straight answer takes guts. You say what you mean, and you
mean what you say. You stand behind your statement with a sense of
responsibility that you take pride and not afraid of being proven
wrong. More than this, you make those statement because you are
actively engaging the customer to understand their needs, did homework
so you have a fair confidence in your recommendation, and make
those recommendation in order to make their life better through your
service. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It is easy to play the word game that gets you off the hook. &lt;span
class="myhighlight"&gt;But please, stop dressing it up with the Chinese
culture, the Chinese language, the Chinese
characteristic&lt;/span&gt;. There is nothing to be proud of in this sense,
because that type of response is &lt;strong&gt;not only irresponsible, but a
complete waste of life&lt;/strong&gt; &amp;mdash; at the end of that conversation, the
woman knew nothing new, and girl knew nothing new either. Next
customer who wanted to know the wait time for this dish, same
ignorance, or same safe answer. The conversation might as well never
happened from both parties' point of view.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And the cashier girl felt great, until she walked out her restaurant and met
with all the other irresponsible responses threw at her by others,
unconsciously as she did, and helped nothing with her decision makings
in life. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Well, if only one can live without making decisions. But, isn't
everyday filled with nothing but million decisions to make? That's
life. So next time, remind yourself, give straight answer, even it is
a "I don't know". I don't believe the beauty of the Chinese language
lies in its low efficiency, and there is a difference between &lt;span
class="myhighlight"&gt;I didn't get the message vs. you didn't tell
me&lt;/span&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Implication? You know there is another name for it &amp;mdash; up for
interpretation. It's fun, until it blows up. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Q: Help! I need help! I'm shot...&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;911: I'm on my way! Will be there 5 minutes. Calm down, keep
pressure on the wound, take deep breath....&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yes, make straight answer, clear instruction, think, I mean really
think, for your customer. Your service isn't there because there is a
position called XYZ. It's there to help ppl, so next time, put a
bit of yourself into it. Responsibility doesn't kill you. It makes you
brave, proud, and respectful.&lt;/p&gt;</content><category term="thoughts"></category><category term="thoughts"></category></entry><entry><title>Consume the future</title><link href="https://fengxia41103.github.io/myblog/future%20value.html" rel="alternate"></link><published>2017-05-24T08:36:00-04:00</published><updated>2017-05-24T08:36:00-04:00</updated><author><name>Feng Xia</name></author><id>tag:fengxia41103.github.io,2017-05-24:/myblog/future value.html</id><summary type="html">&lt;figure class="col l6 m6 s12"&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I was thinking about &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Future_value"&gt;future value&lt;/a&gt; this morning. Why? because I
was thinking about this Chinese phrase, 寅吃卯粮, which means that one
consumes savings meant for future use. The term bears a negative
emotion that is used to criticize someone or some action that is
irresponsible (in view of the present) and generally a bad idea. After
all, shouldn't one only use what his means can cover? It is a
conservative approach, and also sustainable.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What's the equivalent in
english? I thought of future value. Isn't it the same thing that we
are mapping future values to current so we can benefit from, or
consume, it right now. For all we know, forget about the future. It's
uncertain and nobody knows how well those so called &lt;strong&gt;future values&lt;/strong&gt;
will be realized and how well they matching our estimation right now.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The reason I was toying these terms was that I was thinking the &lt;span
class="myhighlight"&gt;root cause of wealth&lt;/span&gt;. I always thought that
the only way to become rich is to take leverage. What is a leverage,
borrowing money, use the resource that you don't own, and with less
cost than the benefit you can get out of them. A convenient way is
certainly to borrow from the someone, somewhere, and don't need to pay
for it. It's free money, isn't it?  &lt;strong&gt;Future&lt;/strong&gt; seems to be a perfect
candidate for this. Nobody has a crystal ball that actually works, but
everyone has a lot of hope. And what is expectation? it is completly
subjective, opinionated, and absolutely impossible to validate (until
it becomes history).  But doesn't the logic smell wrong?  How can you
get a free lunch without paying a price? and if it's not you who pays
the price, then who will? I learned FV in MBA class. The math is
simple enough and at the time I thought this is an artificial
invention used only in finance to make yourself look smart, important
and closer to the truth of wealth. But suddenly I had a thought
&amp;mdash; no, it is not a new concept, and it is not just in finance. It
is everywhere.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;FV the consumer&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Stock price, bond price are all computed based on FV. Market adjusts
their prices based on runtime guess of what the FV is like. Therefore
it will fluctuate constantly. In its core it is consensus decision
making where all market participants are casting a vote.  The price
is nothing but a form of FV. But finance ppl are crooks, you say. They
invented these theories so to justify their irresponsible actions
today. How can there be no harm done if to take what belongs to the
future and use them now? Just take a look at social security, working
class are paying for their parents' generation, and so hope their kids
will pay theirs. This is a ponzi scheme in reality. So what is a
counter example to this? How about manufacturing? They are solid ppl
who make stuff, and making stuff creates value. You can &lt;strong&gt;NOT&lt;/strong&gt; BS around
making a solid bulk of physical stuff, a pile of steel that hums,
works, and makes your life better. Well, let's see. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You have a need to wash your clothes. When you buy a washing machine,
you have taken the underline assumption that you will be using it not
just once, but multiple times in the future. There is a life time by
design, of course, and no one really keeps track of how many loads one
does per week, and how many uses you will be doing in the next 5 years
or before the machine is broken. But that's exactly how the price
represents &amp;mdash; one implicitly gives each load a price, multiplied
over a time span and FV back to the present! This explains exactly why ppl
cares about quality &amp;mdash; because one doesn't know how many times
she is going to use the washing machine, the longer it last, or the
more loads you throw at it, the greater its FV should be, then
discounted to PV, it should have a higher price. Now if you buy it
lower than the PV in your mind, you feel it is a good deal &amp;mdash;
this, I call it &lt;span class="myhighlight"&gt;the truth of the consumer
threshold&lt;/span&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;FV the service&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The story doesn't end here. So after all, the logic of FV is correct?
The financial gurus and manufacturer of consumer goods are all
operating by the same principle. What about the present? We constantly
hear the preach that happiness is about the present and one should
live by the moment. Then how can one do that if one's consumer
instinct is naturally about the future, about FV. Is there anything
only valued at present? How about food? Food is consumed in the
moment, right? There isn't a future value associated with it, or is
there? Or any other service, a haircut, a smile from a cashier,
grocery shopping... transactions are done then and now, you pay, you
get your goods, done, period.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We don't lump sum future services and discount them to a PV price, do we?
or we actually do? When I sit in a restaurant ordered a dish, am I
only paying for this round, this dish, or there is a share of the well
being of this restaurant tomorrow, and next week? Certainly the profit
is the media, or the hidden contract, between me as the consumer
eating this dish, and the restaurant who does its share to be here and
continue its service and maintain its quality. How well, or strong,
should both parties support this bond? Doesn't this make those
thin-margin, low-prices strategy a weaker contract or equally the
same? and when we shop in those value stores, are we lowering our
expectation, thus our FV, but still expecting the contractual
&lt;strong&gt;promise&lt;/strong&gt; hold true?  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Everybody understand you get what you
pay for. Yet, we constantly struggle between a mismatched
over-estimated FV (by our subjective will) and perception of a less
qualified product/service. In math term and in common sense, this gap
will never go away, and should never go away. If FV becomes a fixed
value (think about planning economy where some God view determines a
price, how ridiculous it is if you think of it in this context &amp;mdash;
consensus voting is the only way to discover and determine this value,
therefore the market), how to fix the PV offered by service providers?
and even more troublesome is that how do you know the consumer agrees
with provider on each other's estimation? Taking the washing machine
example, I am willing to put in $1 for a load, and wash weekly. So
10yr span will cost me $520. Anything more expansive than this is a
ripoff, unless I decide to wash 2 loads per week now or the machine
lasts more than 10 years.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Turn the able around, if I manufacture washing machine, I want to know
how many loads &lt;strong&gt;in avg&lt;/strong&gt; a family of size-xyz (look up your country's
demographics and household size) will do, and how much they are
willing to pay per such use, then take the design life that I can
deliver (again, &lt;strong&gt;in avg&lt;/strong&gt;), it's the price my consumers are willing
to accept. The trick then, is how well I can discover these numbers
comparing to how well my competitors are using these numbers. If my
competitor builds a machine twice as durable as mine but sell at the
same PV, should I panic? Obviously now with the context we have
discussed, the key to answer this is &lt;span class="myhighlight"&gt; not
how durable his machine is, but how often consumer changes their
machines&lt;/span&gt;! &amp;mdash; the design life time should last slightly
longer than what customers are expecting to use it for, in theory. If it is
&lt;strong&gt;too durable&lt;/strong&gt;, it is an over design and is a waste. Therefore, a
strategy to defeat my competitor at perception level, I want to show a
machine that lasts twice as long as others' in the market &amp;mdash; no
one is to going to keep it that long, but the image matters.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;Marketing time&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;figure class="col l4 m4 s12"&gt;
  &lt;img src="images/funny/direct%20marketing.jpg"/&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Well, the scenario we discussed so far is implying that consumer will
determine the end date of your discount period &amp;mdash; averagely use a
washing machine for 10 years. We know PV is heavily depending on the
time length. Can we determine or control this time length then?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Many variables come to play, disruptive technology, shift of consumer
interest, fashion, some social change, new generation... this becomes
a fuzzy war. So we need marketing, a voice in consumer's head that now
you should ditch the old product and buy a new one. The more effective
marketing is done, the more deterministic the replenish cycle can
be. Therefore, marketing pushes the FV as much as possible, and
controls the discount period as much as possible. In math it then
becomes apparent the shorter the cycle the higher the PV. Therefore,
if FV are similar, competitors have a diring need to shorten the
cycle, and this I believe is the true root cause of product
innovation &amp;rarr; to the control the cycle. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Interesting, isn't it? So back the our initial topic, I used to think
FV is a fancy term that MBA uses to showoff his education.  Now I
realized FV and PV are everywhere. It is the only way to perceive this
world, it is human nature. So again, I start to believe more and more
that economy and finance are not about numbers, theories of money or
currency or some conspiracy theory of political domination. It is
about human nature, about what we really are. Extract the underline
assumption, and you will see what these terms really mean.&lt;/p&gt;</content><category term="thoughts"></category><category term="thoughts"></category></entry><entry><title>Sync vs. Async</title><link href="https://fengxia41103.github.io/myblog/sync%20async.html" rel="alternate"></link><published>2017-05-23T10:36:00-04:00</published><updated>2017-05-23T10:36:00-04:00</updated><author><name>Feng Xia</name></author><id>tag:fengxia41103.github.io,2017-05-23:/myblog/sync async.html</id><summary type="html">&lt;figure class="col l4 m4 s12"&gt;

&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;h1&gt;Irrelevant&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Sync vs. Async. I have been thinking this to myself and have involved
quite a few discussions with smart (and mostly young) developers which
from time to time makes me wonder whether there is a definite answer
for this at all.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One thing I can fairly state is that there isn't a &lt;strong&gt;right&lt;/strong&gt; or even
an answer. It depends. Yes, it depends on what you mean by sync or
async, and why you care about one way or the other. The discussion
isn't technical, it isn't philosophical, it is to understand use case,
user's expectation, workflow, execution sequence, business assumption,
and maybe last, system performance. If the discussion isn't confined
in these areas, it will go nowhere and quickly downgrade to a heated
argument without a satisfaction from either parties involved but
feelings hurt, self-opinion firmer believed in, and a mine field that
no one is willing to step into again.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Really, a particular framework or programming language does not make
the design async or sync. &lt;a href="http://www.tornadoweb.org/en/stable/"&gt;Tornado&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://github.com/twisted/twisted"&gt;Twisted&lt;/a&gt;, or libs like
&lt;a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/asyncio.html"&gt;Asyncio&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="http://www.gevent.org/"&gt;Gevent&lt;/a&gt;, they …&lt;/p&gt;</summary><content type="html">&lt;figure class="col l4 m4 s12"&gt;

&lt;a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/asyncio.html"&gt;Asyncio&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="http://www.gevent.org/"&gt;Gevent&lt;/a&gt;, they all have the capability to help an
&lt;strong&gt;async implementation&lt;/strong&gt; if needed, but &lt;span class="myhighlight"&gt;
they don't make your design or your architecture
async&lt;/span&gt;. Fundamentally one can even argue that computer
architecture is genetically synchronous because CPU can execute one
instruction at a time, unless multicore can be utilized, and I do mean
they are utilized either by at the HW level where CPU, cache and
memory are smart enough to take some instructions for parallel
computing, or the higher level interpretation -- assembly, C, or sth
even more abstract -- have the design and internal implementation all
the way through to generate those instructions that make the CPU
&lt;strong&gt;smart&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;figure class="col l4 m4 s12"&gt;
  &lt;img src="images/funny/1519232-geek_poke02.jpg"/&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Too many times ppl take multithreading and multiprocessing as the
statement that my code or my design is now asynchronous, or event
drive, or responsive, which all mean the same thing &amp;mdash; it's
superior to a synchronous one. Really? How do you validate all the
components on your stack are implemented so support your statement? Is
DB itself asyn capable (and what does this even mean!?)? is the DB
interface lib asyn capable? is the 30+ imported libs, third-party
tools, code you have written, asyn capable? Is the server lib based on &lt;code&gt;Select&lt;/code&gt;,
&lt;code&gt;epoll&lt;/code&gt;? Is your shell call using &lt;code&gt;check_call&lt;/code&gt;? Is your disk firmware
async? Even step along the stack can bring your system to a halt
regardless how some part of the stack is actually async. So my point
here is &lt;strong&gt;async design or architecture is irrelevant&lt;/strong&gt; because it is
not a technical topic, but a business topic.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;Dependency&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Why so? Because what really matters is &lt;span
class="myhighlight"&gt;dependency&lt;/span&gt;. Your business workflow is the
single voice that will dictate and define dependency. Use PM for
example, if task A is depending on the completion of task B, then
regardless how multitasking the resource assigned to these tasks are,
tasks are executed in sequence, period, because that's what &lt;strong&gt;makes
sense&lt;/strong&gt; in business, even though it slows the entire system down. Technology 
can improve UX by making user's wait more tolerant, but it can not,
and &lt;span class="myhighlight"&gt;should not&lt;/span&gt;, remove the &lt;code&gt;wait&lt;/code&gt; if
it breaks business sense. Mapping this argument to an e-commerce app,
if user needs to add to shopping cart, submit checkout, pay, get
receipt &amp;mdash; well, clicking that submit checkout button should
BLOCK until it's accepted by server before he is presented with
payment view &amp;mdash; sync. What should really be done is sit down and
watch this &lt;a href="https://www.ted.com/talks/renny_gleeson_404_the_story_of_a_page_not_found"&gt;Tech talk&lt;/a&gt;, yes, technology is not a silver bullet
unless you know what you want to get out of it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now looking back to my career, funny the only &lt;strong&gt;real asyn&lt;/strong&gt;
requirement I have encountered is in china's workflow, the concept of
会签（consensus voting &amp;larr; this is my phrase), but without a
majority rule. Go figure. My implementation is to give everyone a
high-five page and not bother to even post data back to the server
&amp;mdash; everything is handled on client side, no IO blocking concern
of any kind, click-at-will and guaranteed consistent and satisfying
responsive, realtime, event driven, taking advantage of any HW
resource the user happens to have, distributed, HA, zero single point
of failure....this, is an asynchronous design.&lt;/p&gt;</content><category term="thoughts"></category><category term="dev"></category><category term="design"></category></entry><entry><title>父亲一家</title><link href="https://fengxia41103.github.io/myblog/family%20info.html" rel="alternate"></link><published>2017-05-18T17:31:00-04:00</published><updated>2017-05-18T17:31:00-04:00</updated><author><name>Feng Xia</name></author><id>tag:fengxia41103.github.io,2017-05-18:/myblog/family info.html</id><summary type="html">&lt;figure class="col s12"&gt;

基地，但生活条件与南方差距甚远，所以更是对自己的生活变得很苛刻。&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;幸福邨&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;父亲还记得自己以前的事情。他说起幸福邨的日子，说起住在那里的人，很多时
候还以为家还在那里。幸福邨是联排屋，我大学的时候家还在那里，整整的一栋
都是，三层，一大家子人都在，以前爷爷奶奶住在顶层，不大下来，我没有见过
奶奶，那天说起亲妈，我从来没有看见过他这么的激动，眼圈都红了。从没有见过父
亲哭，那次是最接近的一次。亲妈那个时候，也该是他现在这个年龄了吧。她是个
小脚女人，没有文化，但很会持家，她是我父亲心目中最尊敬的女性，没有之一。&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;幸福邨我见到的时候，又旧又挤，几家人合用一个厨房，厨房里面有一个浴缸，
晚上洗澡也在里面。这是真正的老上海，并不浪漫，也不温馨。地板是红色的，
很亮，有点儿滑，对在水泥房子里长大的我来说，那是个很奇怪的东西，直到有
了自己的家，一个1915年的老房子，才知道那样的地板是多么的酷。这就
是缺失的审美吧，只在上海这些被时代遗弃并最终被市容改造而推倒的破烂里还
留着些，少有人还愿意打理，只是住户现在拆迁的筹码，早和美没有了关系。
父亲最近常说起幸福邨，问这些人家都怎么安排。他总是担心要分家，怕分的不
公平。我说幸福邨已经拆迁了，大家都分了房子，他的，就在这里，1902，别人
家也都有了自己的，条件也比幸福邨好，这样他才安心。&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;大妈妈（大伯母）&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;父亲叫“大嫂”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;大妈妈是个和蔼慈祥的老太太，见到的时候就是一头白发了。她个子小小的，说
话的时候眼睛总是有调皮的笑，好像暗藏玄机，就等着你说错了出丑。从没见过
她生气，没听过她抱怨。她是正房，大伯伯（后面会讲到）后来遇到了真爱，一
直不再回家，大妈妈从来没有说起过一次，总是挺开心的样子。我太小，无从了
解那时发生了什么，他们会是怎样的想法。现在多了世故，想到她的样子，真是
看不出一点儿的忧伤。只是记得有过一次，怎么谈话中说起大伯伯，好像是我父
亲带我去看他，她用了“那个人”。她记得的，只是不想提。大妈妈最早步入老年，
到了上海的养老院，父亲看过很多次，每次都说这个养老院好，也由此说到他觉
得养老院是个可以给小辈少添麻烦的地方，好，以后有像大妈妈这样好的也要去。
我说你这里就是大妈妈他们同一个养老院，在这里又开了新的，你不是喜欢大妈
妈的那个养老院吗，这个也是。&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;夏增敏（大姐姐）&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;上海话叫“da3 jia1 jia1"，父亲叫“增敏”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;大姐姐和父亲很亲，像兄妹。我父亲因为家里最小，所以我的辈分很高。大姐姐
虽然是我的堂姐，但她的女儿比我大两岁。大姐姐很幽默，早年姐夫过世，她就
一个人带着一个女儿，住在幸福邨一楼和二楼中间的一个小房间里。女儿李洁后
来来了美国，她也就来了这里。听父亲说，大姐姐小时候很喜欢逗我哥，常把他
弄哭，然后再哄他，这像她，她的性格是活泼顽皮的，脑子非常的快，父亲总是
很照顾她们家，她也很了解他的性格脾气，两人在一起总是很多的说笑，父亲如
果见到她，会是开心的。她的房间总是很干净，穿着也是那么的大方，女儿更是
在那个时候第一次让我见识到了上海女孩儿的打扮。如果现在想起来，一个词，
品味。&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;夏赠域（大哥哥）&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;父亲叫“增yo4","da3 guo1 guo1"&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;大哥哥住在二楼。他的房间最大，可能是因为是长孙吧，分到的大，也最新。家
里很漂亮，电器也是最多的。女儿夏炯璐（上海叫“jun jun"）后来也来了美国，
来的时候我还去帮她找房子，参加毕业典礼，后来毕业后她结婚就没什么联系。
大哥哥现在应该多数时间在她家里。&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;大嫂据说年轻时候很漂亮，女儿是公主一样。大学时去幸福邨，他们也是自己
做自己吃，大家虽然同处一层，但来往不多。大哥哥人很好，话不多，和父亲挺
谈得来，改革之初在一个合资厂工作，那时候应该日子也不错。&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;南京，南工&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;父亲大学上了南京工学院，那个时候还叫中央大学，多么大气的名字，
后来改名叫东南大学，父亲总说太小家子，没了原来的神气。南京，就这
样成了他最爱的地方。这次坐车南下，路过南京，我说你看南京了，他转过来看窗外，
脸上有了表情，像以前的他一样，满是神采。故里，记忆，这就是一个地名对一个
人一生的不忘。&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;父亲最得意的时候，一定是他在大学里当足球队长。他床头有一张照片，两
排帅气的小伙子，都是长袖的T shirt，短裤，只有他站在后排的左边，
穿着西装，个子却又不高。是以前的人的风范么，那时的人穿西装，真是意气风发的青年，那种
青春的光彩照人，那么的意气风发，那么的充满朝气。他最津津乐道的是一场代
表学校和南京市队的比赛，他是队长，打后卫，他特地的定了战术，而且得以
实施，他每每说起都是笑，那时的他，还有他的那些大学的同学、队友，都是那
么的年轻，那么的充满未来和希望，那么的在大时代中等待着一番作为。&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;南京是他熟悉的地方，每次必去的是中山陵，灵谷寺，明孝陵。父亲喜欢走路。
和他出游对小孩子是不快乐的，从中山陵到灵谷寺再到哪儿哪儿，都是在走路，
路边记得是很多的竹林，很漂亮，但孩子的心里只记得了几个地名，还有走不完
的路，还得附和着他兴致勃勃的讲解，要听那些历史的故事，回去好写作文，心
里惦记的i只是什么时候能遇到一个卖冰棍儿的老太太，可以买了坐下，解解南
京的酷暑，现在，只记得了竹林，满眼的绿色，中山陵前面的台阶，一个挺威严
的孙中山的雕像，还有他带着的走不完的路。这就是他的南京，都还在，哪天再
走到这些地方，他说的故事，也都还在， 他的神采，也还会在。&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;东北电力设计院，烧菜，他的古典音乐&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;大学毕业分配到了东北电力设计院，那时的东北是好地方，中国最发达的工业基
地，在这儿，他也遇见了我母亲，也有了我们家。东北院当年是辉煌的，主楼三
个对着街的大门，前面是长春最宽的马路，斯大林大街。楼里面地面都是大理石，
还有大理石的楼梯扶手，从二楼到一楼大厅的是小孩子最喜欢的滑梯。院里有幼
儿园，子弟校，医务室，住也都在一起，叔叔阿姨都认识，来办公室找他就像回
家，上班下班都一起走，这种感觉现代人体会不到。&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;父亲一辈子在东北院，专业是输煤，这是个挺偏的学问，到退休了后继无人，倒
成就了他到处飞，给国家咨询公司审核项目。输煤组属于机务室，母亲的化学水
处理也是，两个人上班在同一个楼层，房间离的也不远。这样的安排，现代人得
是多么的羡慕。父亲的专业能力应该很强，后来当了技术处的处长。但最得意的
是做的一手好菜，上海人的缘故吧，知道很多东西怎么吃，单位同事聚会，总是
在我们家。也是第一次喝了一口茅台，呛得半死，只有后来在加州第一次吃
wasabi是这样的，心跳的快休克，从此对白酒没了一点儿好感。父亲最得意的东
西是他的面筋，现在不稀奇了，那个时候除了自己做，别无来源，而作面筋是个
及其费功夫的事儿，但真是好吃。他除了面筋，还把洗出来的面晾干，作灌肠，
那也是我吃过的最好的灌肠，北京找了这么多年，从来没有了。&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;同事最乐道的是他不怕冷，一是他年轻身体好，二是南方的冬天比北方更难熬，
所以他并怕。这个习惯一直到今天，他怕热不怕冷，冬天穿的很少，从来不带帽
子手套围巾，我们都捂成了粽子，他还是单衣，光着两只手，他也总是在忙碌在
作事情，所以可能也真是不冷。单位里的事他从来没说起太多，年轻人好像都喜
欢他，他替他们着想，帮他们出主意，鼓励他们出去闯荡，看世界。后来有了我
哥，名声在外，如何教育也是他常被请去的话题。&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;他做事十分的严谨，看他的字就知道，工工整整，没有电脑的年代，他自己就是
个机器人一样，横平竖直，哥哥可能就像他，所以很受器中，我不行，写字总带
着自己的臆想，在框框里往外飞，现在更是没了半点儿他的味道。父亲最钟爱的
书是《傅雷家书》，从大学起给我们写信，直到近些年不写了，大学以后已经听
不进去他的话，信都留着，按时间顺序排列整齐，等着给他个惊喜，他应该没想
到，不靠谱的我也会有他的印记。&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;父亲并不交际，来往的也就几个。他收集了上千盘的磁带，都是古典音乐，在那
个年代，这是宝贝，他用上了他的印刷体的字，每一个都标注清楚，连曲目，多
少分钟都不差，然后说起来津津乐道，那可真是他的宝贝。家里专门做了一个柜
子，收集这他的珍藏。科技的进步让这些都成了过时货，磁带在苏州的潮湿里八
成也发了霉。多放些古典的曲目给他听，问他喜欢吗，他会说，喜欢。是的，年
轻的时候是听不得古典音乐的，现在，看着他，听着这些，心会静，他即使不说
话，也是在听吧，也还听的到，听见过去的自己。&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;自行车，夏炽邦（大伯伯）&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;上海话伯伯叫”爸爸“，父亲叫他大哥&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;我对大伯伯印象很少，见到他的时候已经是我大学了。那时的他就是个瘦瘦的小
老头，身材像我父亲现在，但很精神。听我父亲说，他年轻的时候很是帅气和英
俊，而且因为早早就在外面做事，在小的弟弟眼里，有很多让人羡慕的东西。父
亲常提起的是大伯伯的一辆自行车，Raleigh,是英国的老牌子，听说是二战时英
国兵的用车，所以这样的战用物资在当地人眼里也是好东西。牌子的标记是一只
凤头，上海人说起来凤头自行车，指的就是它。也正是因为这个，建国后才有了
上海的凤凰自行车，仿照的Raleigh。这就是老上海人的“情怀”，其实都是当时
生活中的一部分，并没有谁刻意，水到渠成了上海人的品味和见识。&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;这辆车应该给我父亲留下了很深的音像，所以我们家我最早记得的两辆自行车，
一辆蓝色的26自行车就是凤凰,父母结婚的见证，而且父亲自己会动手修车，洗
车，小时候有过一次演示给我怎么把轮子都拆开，把滚珠都一粒粒的拿出来，然
后上润滑油，一种像膏一样的、半透明的东西，我记得摸了一下，不喜欢，味
道也是一股油味，不喜欢，用手在土里蹭，结果沾了很多的土，油却还是在。。
小孩子没有耐心，他很津津乐道的讲给我听，也是他很得意的手艺，我后来就失
去了兴趣，至今都没有学会，每每遇到自己的自行车有了问题，真是想拿起电话
来找他。美国的自行车店里修车的架子，工具一应俱全，看了总是想起他，他如
果有这些工具，该是多开心。&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;大伯伯一直抽烟喝酒，父亲说他舞跳的很好。见到他的时候他还是老上海人的样
子，头发梳得很整齐，油油的向后背着，穿一双锃亮的三接头皮鞋，真是有风度。
笑起来就是夏家的人，眼睛眯眯的。他很风趣，说话时眼睛列很多的神采，虽然
那个时候的我和他也不熟悉，听不太懂他在说什么，但看神情能知道他以前是个很
活跃的人。想想在上海他要挣钱养家，又会跳舞，会有多少故事。&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;大伯伯应该以前对我父亲照顾很多，是不是他上大学的钱也是大伯伯资助的，他
好像提过，我不记得了。应该是受了大伯伯的影响，我父亲对上海当年流行过的国外货
情有独钟，家里有一只美国的军用水壶，下面套了一个可以拿下来当饭盒，然后
有一个金属的扣，一扣就合在了一起，那是我小时候运动会时必带的装备，我父
亲一直告诉我那是个好东西，在我眼里，我更羡慕别的小朋友的绿色的军用水壶，
现在想来，是不是撒。&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;苏州，姑姑（亲伯/爸），我们家&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;父亲叫她“阿 jia1”，上海话“阿姐”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;姑姑住在苏州，这也开始了我们家和苏州的缘分，
直到现在我们家也在苏州落了脚，父亲以前也常和我讨论以后养老的地方，说苏
州是他想在的地方。他喜欢苏州的面，小笼包，新鲜的小河虾，青菜，不大的城
市，离上海不远，却又不在其中，可以走路，可以骑车，并且，还有姑姑在时的
地方，都还能认得，都还能见到。&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;亲爸是个好人，是我们家族里所有人都公认的好人。家里重男轻女，她没怎么上
学就开始帮家里作事情。姑父是作什么的我都不知道，我印象里的他已经行动不
便，经常在床上，戴一个很厚很厚的眼睛。他说话挺有趣的，对我很好，教会
了我下中国象棋，虽然小孩子耐心甚少，应该下了一会儿就没了兴趣。&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;姑姑的婚姻应该并不是她所想的,重男轻女的年代，家里的女儿除了嫁人养家，
没有其他的安排和出路。这个是后来听父亲说的。姑姑在苏州园林局工
作，地点就在玄妙观的旁边，现在是个文昌殿了，以前小时候我还常去找她，也
经常在玄妙观里玩。她那里有很多小乌龟什么的，我总是想要拿一个回来，记得
有一次真的给我买了一个，我捧在手里，好小好小的一只，记得就让它在我手里
爬，它爬到边上了，赶紧用另一只手接过去，就让它这么爬，感觉好神奇，有一
个比自己还小的生物，可以动，感觉都可以和它交流说话，自己懂得它想要什么。&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;我小时候在苏州出生，长大到小学一年级，就住在姑姑家，一个苏州的院落，里
面几家的住户，有一口井。我后来养了两只小乌龟，就放养在院子里。夏天大家
在院子里乘凉，井上盖了一个脸盆，有时候就听&lt;code&gt;砰噔&lt;/code&gt;一声，就是我的乌龟爬到
井边，结果掉到了脸盆里。姑姑的收入不高，两个女儿，我们叫大姐、小姐，因
为从小在那儿长大，走在苏州的巷子，白墙黑瓦，就觉得像是家,也总吃不厌苏
州的面，总在寻找记忆里的味道，但找不到了经常。&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;母亲生下哥哥后得了一场大病，差点就没了。东北的生活条件太差，妈妈就到了
苏州来养病，并且，我父亲总是认为上海的医学水平才是最高的，这就是他的上
海情节吧。后来有了我，就又来到苏州，把我生下后寄养在了苏州，就这样成了
一个苏州人，一直到小学一年级结束回到长春。他们说我那时会讲一口的苏州话，
不记得了。但大学来上海，第一天打开收音机，听上海的滑稽戏，我就乐的不行，
其他的外地同学还要刻苦学习上海话，像学英语一样，都还是听不懂，这我一直
以为就是小时候的记忆还在。那时小，记得的不多了，记得那个院子，记得水池
旁边的鼻涕虫，记得两只小乌龟下雨的时候会出来吃东西，记得地砖上的青苔，
好像常年都在，记得听过一次评弹，记得晒衣服的竹竿，不记得了他们说的一个
带我的奶奶，奶奶说过来你眼神好给我的针穿个线，小孩子不容易逮住，那就一
次多穿几根，然后等她回来，我说穿好了，给她一根线上穿了10根针，小孩子的
耳朵，真是长到了哪里！亲爸对我就像是我的母亲，我只记得她对我很好，还有
后来父亲经常讲起来她怎么宠我，说我坐在蚊帐里，她把吃的东西递到蚊帐里给
我，我妈妈来看我时候看到了，说我被宠坏了。&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;亲爸一直养花，我记得院子里有好多的花，还有蚕树，我小时候养过蚕，看到他
们结茧，但没想到最后变出来一个褐色的蛾子，这对我的心灵冲击不小，因为蛾
子在我的脑子里可不好玩，手摸了会有粉，那时候被告知这个粉不能吃，吃了会
变成哑巴，所以蛾子对我是个挺恐怖的东西。亲爸养的花特别的好，我不认识花，
有时候会闻到花香，觉得好熟悉，那真是人深层的记忆，都说不出是什么花香，
但知道自己闻过，好熟悉的味道，像家，像过去，像不记得却又不忘记的曾经。&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;就这样，苏州也成了我们家最亲近的地方，亲爸在我大学的时候，92还是93年因
为肝癌过世了。虽然那时也不懂得死亡是什么，都不知道应不应该悲伤，觉得自
己好没有良心。但上海一家人一起坐火车到苏州站的时候，看见苏州两个字，真
的知道了悲伤原来是这样的感觉，失去，如同后来经历过的各种失去一样，好让
人难过，又怎能不哭呢？最后一次去看姑姑，我都不记得了她的情况，小姐（我
的表姐，下面会讲到）送我到门口，我转身给她100块钱，说本来是我想工作以
后把第一个月的工资给亲爸的，但怕来得及了。那个时刻还不知道就会分别，只
是预感吧，也是自己把心里想要做的事情、要说的话说了，自己心里会好受些。
但就是这样的，由于彼此那么的熟悉，由于彼此那么的在意，预感就是真实的，
是最终会应验的。这样的预感后来还有过一次，是和我哥。&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;两个苏州的姐姐 -- 大姐，小姐&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;父亲叫她们全名的时候多，有时候也叫小名芸芸，铃铃&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;姑姑有两个女儿，我们叫大姐（胡德芸）、小姐（胡德玲）。小时候在苏州，总
是小姐管着我，所以我印象里的小姐挺厉害的。小姐后来工作就接了姑姑的班，
也在园林局工作，后来是会计，在北寺塔，每次回国到苏州，我都会去北寺
塔找她，一说她的名字就可以进去，给她个惊喜。父亲常说两个姐姐继承了姑姑
的风范，非常的热情热心，也很靠得住，所以他们退休后就从长春落脚到了苏州。
那个时候我和哥哥已经都出国，所以他们这个举动也是为今后的养老作了安排，
两个姐姐就像女儿一样。&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;大姐小姐性格很不一样，因为比我大很多，所以我了解的并不多。大姐大大咧咧
的，说话声音也大，做事很快，雷厉风行，总让我觉得吵架得找她，她一出马就
一定可以了。小姐话少些，行事应该更细心，事情考虑的很周到，姐夫后来当了
苏州观前街改造的负责人，生活也就此变得很好。我们家也借着这个关系在观前
街改造的回迁房里买了一套。姑姑原来的院子在街南，叫碧凤坊，已经没了踪影，
记得小时候每次台风过后，走在观前街上，都是倒下的树，然后去新华书店买铅
笔，课本，还有两分的冰棍儿。现在也住的不远，父母都很喜欢，离从前的
记忆也不远，还是可以走路到观前街，那个新华书店也还在。&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;夏炽国（二伯伯），二妈妈，大咪，小咪，出国&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;二妈妈是二伯母，父亲叫“二嫂”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;二伯伯我没有印象，因为他文化大革命的时候就自杀了。他们家和我们这个家族
都离的很远，直到我的哥哥上大学。二伯伯年轻时候的一个同学，家境很好，父
亲是做地产生意的，后来去了香港，家里最小的一个女儿留在了上海，就是二妈
妈。&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;二妈妈是我见过的最富有的上海小姐了。我们家只是小康，听说爷爷开过一个
“常德榨油厂”,后来还有一个饼干厂，日子虽然也好过过一阵，但后来都破败了，
个中原因我也不知道。二妈妈家可不一样，满屋子的红木家居，一直请着一个保
姆，地板要打蜡，一个人住着这么大的房子，非常的不一样。二妈妈很多见识，
两个女儿，我们叫大咪姐姐、小咪姐姐，都非常的漂亮也很出众，两个都是学的
医，在我的印象里非常的优雅得体，那真是大家闺秀。我和她们接触的很少，小
咪姐姐是我哥哥的年纪，大咪姐姐我第一次有印象，已经是她准备去美国定居之
前了，都不知道说什么，也不知道该怎么站怎么坐，就觉得不是一个世界里的人，
有些尴尬。&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;二妈妈后来当了中学里的生物学老师。她父亲应该留了足够的财产给她，她工作
一是自己想要做事，二是后来文化大革命抄了家，有可用的钱也不能用，怕惹麻
烦。但总是有香港的哥哥在，所以生活上是比平常人家好很多的。因为这些经历，
二妈妈一直就要孩子出国，父亲也因此影响吧，在我很早的时候就知道我未来要
走出国这条路。后来小咪姐姐先嫁了人去了美国，然后大咪姐姐也是，哥哥上了
复旦物理系，大学毕业后虽然分配到吉林工业大学工作，但那是龙游潜池，大家
都知道他不会在那里很久的，一定是出国。那时的出国只有一个办法，拿全额的
奖学金，这对他并不难，我能出去倒真是个奇迹。91年南方发大水，交大
的军训都缩短到了1个月，而且是在校，排了通宵的队买到去北京的火车票
送他，其实那一刻也就决定了我之后也必然
是这样的路。所以，我们家的出国梦始于二妈妈。&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;二妈妈知道很多教育的理念，做人的道理，上大学的时候我常去她家，在陕西南
路，那时的陕西南路并不觉得复古，和其他的上海的街道一样，我们家的华山路
也很漂亮，很多大的洋房，都带花园。小咪姐姐的婚礼就在丁香花园，让我很早
就知道丁香花园是个好地方，边上有一个面包房，每次走过都是bakery的香，
香。我哥哥总是用这个气我，因为我年龄太小，等我到大学的时候，这些表姐
堂姐们都已经成家，我一个婚礼都没有赶上，第一次吃宴席，是我姑姑的葬礼之
后，感觉很别扭，那时的大学生，又是很饿，又觉得场合不对怎么可以大吃。二
妈妈烧菜很好吃，每次我去她都很开心，一定烧好多的菜，自己吃的不多，最后
都是我消灭，很大的满足感。有时候还在家里住一晚，家里单独有房间给我，大
大的电视，沙发，床，床头还有音响，那真是都让人无所适从，幸福来的太快。
二妈妈家一直有佣人，帮着打扫和洗菜，但二妈妈不让她烧，这在我也是第一次，
然后吃饭也不在一个桌子上，第一次分了等级，即陌生又很尴尬，觉得这样不对
或是不好，也不懂为什么会有这样的规矩。一次那个老妈妈掏出一个纸条，她儿
子的电话，让我帮她拨电话给他，很高兴可以为她做些事情，觉得举手之劳，可
以让老人家这么开心，多好，&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;因为二妈妈家庭的背景吧，二伯伯文化大革命受了冲击，自己最后结束了生命。
后来二妈妈也要带学生下乡，就留了两个女儿在上海，常听她说起这段经历，每
次都恨那个年代，恨造成这个年代的人。那时候觉得她好大的愤怒，自己也不懂，
觉得为什么要那么的恨，现在开始明白了，只是人那个时候还没有受过伤，不知道伤的感觉，
不知道心里的伤，如果没有机缘的照顾，就没有机会愈合，会陪一辈子，难过一
辈子。就这样，这个家庭，既是富足得让人羡慕的，又是这么大的悲伤。&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;大咪姐姐，姐夫，我们家的红楼梦&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;大咪姐姐嫁了二妈妈的学生。他应该是个很活跃的人，我第一次见到他的时候在
上海锦江饭店，第二次在锦仓文华，人生中第一次，大餐，大世面。他那个时候
已经在美国作生意，很富有，回上海不住在家里，当时的锦江饭店，锦仓文华，
全上海最贵的地方，记得一层靠街的一排有一些小店，卖衣服服饰的，好漂亮，
路过都不敢往里面看，因为里面的女服务员们也都穿的很精致，漂漂亮亮的，这
在男大学生眼里，是不敢直视的女人的魅力。&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;那次去是二妈妈带着，姐夫请家里人吃饭，一桌10个人，他的父母，二妈妈和我，
还有几个上年纪的我都不认识。吃的什么都不记得了，有一个不会忘， 每个人
有一份鲍鱼，第一，从来没有吃过会单独有一份东西是给你的饭；二，二妈妈把
她的给了我，说这个好吃，我平时也吃不到，让我尝尝。真是暴殄天物，大学生
除了饿就是饿，真是没有一点点的印象，就觉得是一块没有骨头的肉，吃了两块
儿怎么能够呢？那次的饭现在都不记得了，就记得最后账单二妈妈专门拿给我看，
1000块人民币。我一个月的生活费是100，在同学里都是中上有余了，1000，真
都不知道那是多少钱，好多钱吧。&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;姐夫做什么生意的不知道，就知道后来很发达，第一次见到大咪姐姐是她准备去
美国定居，坐头等舱，对于只做过火车的我来说，没有概念。大咪姐姐穿的很漂
亮，大儿子小欣父亲常说非常有礼貌，家教很严，父亲去做客，把吃的东西放在
桌上，小家伙5岁，会马上拿起来扔到垃圾桶，说不可以随便放，妈妈要说的。
二儿子小杰可能太小了，完全没有印象，就是个baby吧。
后来97年研究生毕业，带父母去了一次Washington DC
大咪姐姐家，那真是，唯一的一次开车需要从门口的大门一直开到房子的入口，
一个圆形的转盘，像香港的电影一样，真正的million dollar house。那时候的
大咪姐姐的家是多么的让人羡慕。有一次周末从二妈妈家回学校，正巧姐夫的公
司的人在家里，二妈妈让他送我回去，一辆Lexus，一直开到本部番隅路的校门，
然后开到了校园里，应该很拉风吧，但自己只是坐立不安，迈出车子的时候好想
隐身。这就是第一次接触到了有钱人，接触到了一个不知道的世界，觉得和自己
的生活没有交集。&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;后来姐夫的生意出了问题，很多家里的事情也只是听父亲说起，知道大咪姐姐很
不容易，二妈妈也一直和他们生活。小欣从小很帅气，像美国的ABC，后来上了
Harvard B school。小杰上了Stanfor的数学系，第一个学期在Wall street
internet，据说就是年薪20万，
让人感觉家庭的传承是多么的牢固，虽然一代人起起落落，
最终家庭的教育、见识，还会再次起步，小欣来HBS的时候姐姐、姐夫都来送他，在
Boston得以一聚，很难得。觉得自己家的发展能有今天，二妈妈是所有的原点。谢谢她。
每每说起大咪姐姐一家的事情，就想起红楼梦，&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;小咪姐姐&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;小咪姐姐很漂亮，姐夫家有海外关系，所以她是最早出国的，也开始了夏家的出
国运动。她和我哥哥年纪相仿，据说很谈的来。见到她的时候已是97年带我父母
去看二妈妈的时候了，自己开了牙医诊所，后来的生活非常的富足。一个女儿，Angela,
地地道道的ABC，印象里的她也就婷婷的大小，10岁左右。哥哥的事情的时候，
不知道什么原因，小咪姐姐没有来。这在父亲那里一直不能释怀，也影响给了我。&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;三伯伯（夏炽球），萍萍姐姐，新加坡&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;父亲叫他“七哥"&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;三伯伯最像我父亲，笑起来一模一样，据说脾气也是一样，特别的犟，但父亲总
说七哥的性格最好，从来不着急也不发火，但命运对他不公平。三伯伯喜欢艺术，
家里有字画，认识很多这样的朋友，像最早春晚里演哑剧的严顺开，还有演济公
的游本昌。最早见到的时候给我看他的邮票，后来给我看他收集的字，听父亲说，
他的字写的家里最漂亮，按现在的说法就是个文艺青年。父亲每每说起三伯伯都
怀着一种感激，说他为夏家做了很多，尤其我母亲生病的时候，帮了我们很多的
忙。但受到的待遇是不公平的。三伯伯的女儿，萍萍姐姐，后来嫁到了新加坡。
高考的时候她来长春补习，住在家里，那时我还小，所以这样两家走的很近，大
学的时候也常去他们家。只记得三妈妈（三伯母）总拉着我说家长里短，我听不
太懂，也不知道该有什么态度和意见，她叫我“五锋”（上海话离的夏读“五”），
也让我觉得有些奇怪，不知道怎么应对。她是个好人，97年的冬天回国，正巧赶
上了她落葬，第一次听那么多人说起她来，都说她这样的好那样的好，我印象里
最像上海小女人的人，就是她了。&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;伯母走后，三伯伯后来也搬来了苏州，住的离家里很近，和我父亲一起去同里、
周庄、朱家角，那个时候的父亲是快乐的，看照片列他俩很开心。三伯伯依然每
次见到，都说的最多的是他的花园，他弄的这样的那样的小玩意儿，多是自己的
手工制作，用些邻居不要的废旧的东西，然后说的满脸的得意，很有成就感。屋
子里东西不多，很简朴，但总是有些字画、盆景、小工艺品，突然一下拉我过去
说来给你看这个，满脸的孩子气的炫耀给我看，想想好可爱。父亲现在还常问起
七哥，问他还回不回来。三伯伯16年去了新加坡，不会回来了，据说父亲的状况
第一次让大家意识到，也是送三伯伯走的时候。兄弟情深，但总是得离别。&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;母亲张迈毅&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;我母亲，北京人。两人同在东北电力设计院工作工作了一辈子，也在长春生活了
一辈子。母亲很能干，今年也80了，不服老，性格很强，能力强的人性格都强，
很多想法，这也像我，让我害怕老了会像她，那我还是不要等到那会儿的好。她
和父亲以前很好，我一直这么认为，但我们都走了他俩开始各种生活上的不合拍，
父亲节俭夏天也不肯开空调，母亲不肯，她调到26度，父亲调到28度，就是这样，
互相消耗这时光和记忆。他俩性格都很犟，不肯妥协，两个都说不通，后来我也
不说了，各自怎么生活都行，只要自己开心就好了。&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;母亲北京人，几个兄弟都在北京，也不习惯苏州的天气，夏天太热，冬天太冷，
所以两个人一半一半，冬天在北京过春节，春天回苏州，然后夏天可能又回北京，
然后秋天再来苏州。以后没这样的机会了，父亲喜欢南方，我问他如果你最后自
己不能动了，你会选择北京还是上海还是苏州，他说那还是苏州好。现在就在上
海、苏州的中间，有乡音，有家乡的菜，有各种上海周边的人的青浦话，松江话，
这样的那样的话，离他的同学，他的同事，他的从前最近，我想，他知道的话是
会高兴的。&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;母亲对生活很多的理念，很能干，织毛衣，各种的花样的设计，自己动手，那时
的家其乐融融，哥哥出了国，我也在大学等着出国，前途似锦，一片光明。那时
的她也是骄傲的，两个这么好的儿子，这么好的未来的生活。日子一直都不差，
她有一个不停息的心，和时代同步，学电脑，学手机，学微信，但这也让她和父
亲的距离越来越远，父亲弄不来h这些东西，他也想，但不愿意被母亲说着去做，
后来就索性不做了。现在的两个人，不知道。父亲还常问起她，说不要和她分开。
停不住的是时间，能在一起的时候不开心，那上帝发的下
一张牌，可能就是，要分开了。&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;夏雷（哥）,田文彤（嫂子），婷婷(Nicole)&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;我哥65年5月6日，属蛇，大我8岁。他是父亲最喜欢，最器中，最觉得得意的作
品。他从小学习极好，又很不受u传统那些条条框框的束缚，老师一方面恨的不
行，一方面实在喜欢他的才气。我没赶上他的各种粉丝女暗恋者，但即使到了最
后，不说也能感觉到那个谁谁，当初一定是爱他的一个人。他名气太大，在院里
谁都知道夏雷，我考到省实验的第一天，班主任叫我到门口，给另一个老师指着
说，这是夏雷的弟弟。就是这样，高中的三年我的身份，惭愧。现在想想，是不
是当成功的人的家人都是这样的，妻子丈夫人前显贵，另一个确如何实现和认知
自己呢？只有无知无畏的二代们才愿意生活在父辈的影子里，没了自我还很开心。&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;他考到复旦，我考到交大。他出国，我也出国，他的脚印就是我的必经之路。高
中时怕他像怕神，父母出差都不在，晚自习愁了一晚上，考试成绩不好，要回去
交代，今天就是他跟我，完蛋了。旁边的同学说你怎么这么怕你哥啊，我说我觉
得只有离家出走或是一死了之两个办法了。但要面对的总要面对，那是一个漫长
的夜晚，现在说娃娃的时候，常让我想起他，而我就是现在的娃娃，真是让人着
急。被他说的倒是开了窍，知道了怎么总结归纳自己考试中的错误。这个成了我
以后安身立命的习惯，从高考到考TOEFL考GRE，到现在自己的工作，无处不在。
敏而好学，他十几岁就悟出来了，我到三十几才明白，这就是差距。&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;他学了物理系，从来对文科生嗤之以鼻，这绝对的影响了我对
文科、文艺、文学、艺术、绘画、诗歌、各种综艺的接受程度，很低。他也和父
亲一样喜欢古典音乐，以后的理想是吹saxphone。他身上有优越感，但对我，就
是个哥哥，有他在的时候，我觉得自己英文都不会说，也不用说，总是他会去问
路，会和别人交谈。他走了，真的感觉自己就长大了，得担责任，得照顾爸妈，
得管好自己。在ICU看到他的时候，他已经不能说话了，上了呼吸机，好心的印
度护士告诉我，前几天有个病人也是上了呼吸机，后来就好了，就拆了呼吸机然
后人慢慢康复了。现在回头看，才知道那只是对我们的安慰吧。我说"哥，我来
了"，拉着他的手，他用指甲狠狠压了一下。我说我知道，我会照顾婷婷，会照
顾爸妈。多么无力的承诺啊，婷婷自己就长大了，嫂子照顾的很好，她也很好.爸
妈现在老了，会的，哥，你不在没事儿，我在。&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;父亲在苏州真山买了墓地，夏家的一排，自己的，还有哥的，都在一起。哥的骨
灰分成两份，一份在苏州陪爸妈，一份在我身边。每次去看他，如果就我一个人，
都给他听听我的音乐，给他看看现代的科技，他没见过，但如果他在，我知道他
会怎么说。他那么聪明的人，一定也是很多的观点，很多的嗤之以鼻，很多的幽
默。父亲昨天又问起了哥，问他住在哪儿。如果失忆也可以让人忘记那些忧伤的
事，那它也好，让他觉得哥哥还在，还在生活，还让人担心，让人惦记，和他说
夏雷挺好的，婷婷也挺好的，过些天来看你，他会安心。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I was sitting in this underground little food court, breathing the
muggy air, eating a spicy food, watching people coming in and out,
full of life, full of noise, full of hope. Yet, I kept wondering that
everybody here has one type of headache or another in their lives,
just the same. But how ignorant we are of each other. We judge
people's mind from such a shallow observation, yet have no mean nor
much interest in knowing what they really are. The only thing we know
is that they must have something that bother them, make them sad, make
them happy, make them mad, make them forget the life troubles for a
moment, and make them fall into a sinking feeling late at night that
they felt giving it up.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That's how I felt. The two weeks have been a tough time. I knew it's
coming. Mentally it's such a sure thing that I felt watching a train
approaching a station, however slow it may be, it is coming, and there
is no other …&lt;/p&gt;</summary><content type="html">&lt;figure class="col l4 m4 s12"&gt;

&lt;p&gt;That's how I felt. The two weeks have been a tough time. I knew it's
coming. Mentally it's such a sure thing that I felt watching a train
approaching a station, however slow it may be, it is coming, and there
is no other way out but to deal with it. Facing reality is difficult,
not only of his deterioating health, which is rather natural and
inevitable, but to realize what is lost is loss, and there is no
turning back the clock. All the old memories flushed through my brain
and choked me without mercy. There it is, there they are, look at
them, yes, look at them, because regardless whether you are looking at
it or not, it is staring at you in the face, and that's the reality.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;How sad. I felt I wasn't going to make it. Where to begin? and where
to end? I lost it in this storm without the slightest understanding of
what went wrong and why it happened so quickly, so thoroughly, and so
painfully. It's hard. This is really hard. I could only tell myself to
keep pedaling, keep head above the water, keep breathing, keep the old
routine as a string attached to the life I know and I like, to keep it
sane. Such a lonely fight. Not that I'm afraid of taking it on. There
is nothing to be afraid of, what will come will come, what will leave
will leave. I followed my instinct, my experience of the best
I-know-how, and I know I can survive even it's a lost battle. Yet, the
process is too hard. I can understand now people in depression will
take their lives just like that. It's easier, really. Not that there
is not hope, but the path to get there, to get even closer to that
hope, is hard, too hard to bear, too hard to imagine, too hard to
recall, too hard to be forgotten.&lt;/p&gt;</content><category term="thoughts"></category><category term="love"></category></entry><entry><title>Nursing home evaluation</title><link href="https://fengxia41103.github.io/myblog/nursing%20home%20evaluation.html" rel="alternate"></link><published>2017-05-05T16:31:00-04:00</published><updated>2017-05-05T16:31:00-04:00</updated><author><name>Feng Xia</name></author><id>tag:fengxia41103.github.io,2017-05-05:/myblog/nursing home evaluation.html</id><summary type="html">&lt;figure class="col l6 m6 s12"&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Due to Dad's deterioating condition, nursing home becomes a necessary
option that we must consider as a way to handle this situation. The
following are notes most based on recollection and first impression
so that they are likely biased and are certainly opinionated.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Sites visited:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;北京金手杖: recommended by my college group and by a highschool

&lt;li&gt;苏州怡养园: recommended by 大姐、小姐 and our neighbour. It's meant
   to be the best option in Suzhou.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;上海泰康申园: recommended by a BJ friend. The facility also has locations in

&lt;h1&gt;Basic model&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;All sites run with the same model by having two offerings:
independent living 自理 and dependent care 护理. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Independent care rents a room with one or two beds. Helper is extra
and completly depending on client's preference. You can either hire
theirs or bring your own. Costs include rent, helper, food, utility.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Dependent care charge per bed. Helper is mandatory and is depending on
the severity of client's condition. Costs include rent, helper, and
food. Overall expanse is roughly 50% more expansive than the one of
independent care.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There are community rooms of various kind and group
activities such as singing, dancing, movie, interest group and such.
Basic services usually include laundry, room cleaning,
hair cut, physical therapy, nutrition consulting. Quality however varies.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;/tbody&gt;
&lt;/table&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;Independent care 自理区&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Independent care can be rather lively. People in BJ site are rather
young. So it feels more like a group living that these people are
seeking fun being together. Since helper service is not mandatory it
is more of a rental service with basic house cleaning, community
living, 一日三餐 ready, and accessibility to medical service and
additional help when needed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Helpers are nearly all 农村妇女 with likely low education level since
the expectation is room service instead of personal/medical
service. They usually charge a basic fee regardless whether you hire
their helpers or not. Utility is charged per room. One can cook, and
some even allow unregistered family members living there so a room can
accommodate more than the patient. 上海泰康 charge per head instead of
room.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;/tbody&gt;
&lt;/table&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;Dependent care 护理区&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;First of all, none provide dedicated dementia services. They all have
such patients. Only 上海泰康 is actively pursing assisting methods to
battle deterioating situation; all others are merely accommodating
with challenges of basic living and no more.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Since these patients are at mercy of these care takers, I think it
becomes crucial to evaluate their attitude towards the disease, the
effect on the patient and people around him, and the approach they are
to take to help the situation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;北京金手杖&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Facility is nearly identical to its independent care section except an
added nurse frontdesk on each floor. However the woman doctor
disappaered during my short visit and the desk was unattended. Even
though there is medical cabinet in the back room, I felt the room
was strangely uncluttered so I suspect the room doesn't have much
supply, therefore the service it can provide will also be limited.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I did not see any patient with Dad's symptom. They may be taken for
walk, or the patient they have are 卧床 type instead of Dad's
situation. Either way, helpers are midage country women who unlikely
received much training. There is 1 on 1 available but the person will
not sleep in the same room, therefore this is only a 12-hour deal.
Independent section, on the other hand, has room with double beds or a
small storage room that can be used for helper's bedroom.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Each room has two beds so it is shared. However, not many patients on
the floor I visited so many rooms are open to pick.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The sales we spoke to knew the services well. There were a few
occasions that residents greeted her so she was well recognized and
people seemed like her. The atmosphere was light hearted and
easygoing, which was a comforting sign.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;苏州怡养园&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Facility is similar to its independent care section with an added
nurse frontdesk. Nurse was there chatting with an old guy on
wheelchair. The old man wanted to make a call to his son and so she
helped him that. I couldn't tell whether it was a pretended call or
real. The old guy started talking to the person on the other end of
the phone that 你怎么还不来阿，他们对我不好... and the nurse and a few
people nearby looked at the scene and thought it was funny. There was
no sign that a visitor like me may be disturbed by such a message
however unreal it may be. This made me quite uncomfortable.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We visited at their lunch time. There were about 30 patients, 5 to 6
per table. Same cookie cutter food (see photo) with no personal care
to feed them even though one person apparently had trouble finding his
mouth. All were wearing an apron (their way to keep them tidy). There
was little conversation between staff and the olds. Another thing that
brushed me the wrong side was that I was allowed to take photos of
them sitting at desk eating or waiting for their food despite of the
&lt;strong&gt;No photo is allowed&lt;/strong&gt; sign on wall. Neither the sales nor the nurse
showed any sign of warning. I felt bad for these olds sitting there as
if they were on display.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Helpers were mostly country looking midage male and females, reminding
me the staff who used to work in my college cateferia. Nurse at the
front desk is a girl in her 20s.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Each room has the old's photo posted but there were few personal
belongs such as photos. The whole place made me feel that person touch
was there for a show.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Sales were a young guy with busy phone calls throughout our
conversation. He lacked knowledge (or there just wasn't any) of
service details and used common skills to skim through my questions
without giving straight answers. Further, I met the head doctor, a
woman in her mid-40s, who appeared to be knowledgeable of Alzhymer
symptoms. We were discussing about medical evaluation options, during
which she brought up a few times that they are not responsible for
medical conditions and will send the old to hospital if medical
attention is needed. Even though this is mutually understood, but she
made feel a lack of will to be responsible in general. Both these two
people talked with shifting eyes looking at each other as if to sync
the message. This turned me off.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;上海泰康(申园)&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Facility is absolutely top notch. The library room and movie theater
were impressive. There were cleaning staff throughout the building and
everything was nearly spotless. All elevators are equipped with a
bench where the olds can sit down &amp;mdash; a nice touch. Facility
includes a full scale hospital and its 19th and 20th floor are
dedicated dementia (they call it &lt;strong&gt;memory loss&lt;/strong&gt;) sections. Section is
guarded with double security doors and required badge access.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We run into the young girl who is charge of this section. First
impression was good. She felt 很细心, not rushing to speak when asked
and knew her stuff very well. She has a notebook with patient's
schedule and observation notes. Each patient's are listed in
30-min intervals with handwriting notes of the person's preference,
habit, things staff should pay attention. When we wanted to sit down
in community room for further discussion, the sales girl asked for 
her permission and she closed door behind us. It was apparent that
protecting the patient's space was well observed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Also, photo of patient was strictly prohibited. Another plus point.  I
visited at their lunch time. There were two young girl at desk helping
three olders, one was being fed by a young girl. The others had no
trouble eating by themselves. They actually appeared completly
normal. Nurse at frontdesk were also helping at desk which is located
right in front of the nurse counter. The girls know these patients
well and can elaborate their features, habits, and often their recent
changes.  The conversation between them were soft, kind and not
demeaning in any way.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Patient has single room. Occupied rooms are off the limit for visitors
and doors were all shut. This was another difference from the other
sites, at which sales were inviting me to look into others' as a
showroom.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A highlight of this visit was when I was impressing how little one can
do to help them. The woman manager countered that they created simple
games for them, similar to ones for babies, and "他们可以作这些简单的
游戏". There is also nutritionist who is responsible to each patient's
meals.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Overall, in this place I felt &lt;strong&gt;hopeful&lt;/strong&gt;, and what a priceless feeling anyone can
wish for right now?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;上海凯健Cascade Health&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This was a complete disappointment. The sales contact were not there
and the frontdesk boy she directed me knew next to nothing about the
service and price. Walking around the facility was rather depressing
also.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;First, the location bragged river view (by 黄浦江). Yet the section of
that water can at most be called a creek. Forget about the view, I
suspect there is even much water in that canal.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Many sections of the facility had no lights. Since it was a cloudy day
the whole place felt poor lit and damp. I peeked into a few rooms in
both sections. There were couples living together with likely their
own furniture since they look awefully familiar to those I found in 江
南 homes &amp;mdash; all dark colored and looked heavy. All room doors
were semi-opened which is another living custom among
southerners. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There were physical therapy for patients who are paralyzed. I couldn't
however tell how well it was received or performed. Since little
information the boy was able to provide, the tour was short, dry and
little helpful. Oh well, so much for an international name.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;td&gt;2&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;/tbody&gt;
&lt;/table&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;Recommendation&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Based on all these and the indirect signals I picked up, I highly
recommend 上海泰康 for Dad's well being both in the short term and in
the long run.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To get in it requires 200k deposit and 3-month fee, an all-inclusive
24k per month &amp;rarr; 280k at first payment. Each following month
payment can be handled by dividing it into three tranches:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Dad's pension: 7000&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Suzhou fund: 10000&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Feng: 7000&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;First of all, this is sustainable. Suzhou fund has plenty to sustain
in that rate and will leave good amount reserve for rainy days. 
My portion is affordable with my current job.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Second, this makes it possible that we all keep our current job and
family setup without much change. Of course being nearby is still
preferred. But this level of service makes one feel comfortable to
leave for job or travel if needed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Third, Mom may join. If the facility is inviting for her, she
can decide to join nursing home soon, thus making an arrangement now instead of
later. To afford this we will make it clear that one of the two houses
must be used for the support. This can also help her to realize the
tradeoff and, if so, use the equity for true need instead of paper
profit. Not to mention liquidation now also lessen the hassles of their
will concerns.&lt;/p&gt;</content><category term="thoughts"></category><category term="family"></category></entry><entry><title>My la la land</title><link href="https://fengxia41103.github.io/myblog/la%20la%20land.html" rel="alternate"></link><published>2017-04-30T23:57:00-04:00</published><updated>2017-04-30T23:57:00-04:00</updated><author><name>Feng Xia</name></author><id>tag:fengxia41103.github.io,2017-04-30:/myblog/la la land.html</id><summary type="html">&lt;figure class="col l4 m4 s12"&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Maybe it's the travel, maybe it's the stress of my dad's worsening
health condition, maybe I'm tired from all these and trying the
impossible without knowing the loss is done already. But I know why
I'm sad. The life went the way I hoped but myself couldn't bear the
thought nor the future. What is wrong with me!? Why cannt I stand by a
thought and take its consequence instead of saddening when it is lost
but cannt hold on when it's there?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There hasn't been a movie touched me like this for a long time. But
this one hit me to the core. I don't know. Why cannt people hold on to
love and go through the so called realities and come out cherishing
each other more? Shouldn't the common struggle and experience and the
talk and the happy and unhappy moments become a milestone that marks
the path both have walked, together? How many times can you really
walk with someone so close, so intimate, so letting all guards down,
weaving the image …&lt;/p&gt;</summary><content type="html">&lt;figure class="col l4 m4 s12"&gt;

weaving the image into a future that two, instead of one, are in it? &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I hate the ending of this movie. I just hate it. Fxxk reality, fxxk
success. It means nothing, absolutely nothing, to me if success is
here and the person I cherished is gone. What is the point? whom are
you showing the trophy to? who has been cheerleading you and give you
the strength and courage to get you where you are? I guess there are
people in life whose appearance is to bring something good out of you,
then their job cease to exist and they fade away. But why!? why!?
why!? If you are becoming a better person because of this mate, then
what is so &lt;strong&gt;better&lt;/strong&gt; of your becoming if you take a separate path now
in life? Why? Wouldn't it be better than you can stay with the
soulmate or the make-you-a-better-person person so you two continue to
produce the better self and learn from each other? Why stop?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I truly don't understand. But this is a movie that made me cry and to
write this journal so I will ask myself later what was sad about it
and why cannt I be over it. No I cant.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Love, is the wonder in life. Without it, life is ugly, vain, and pain.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I don't know. I only know one way to love, to carry the weight in
heart, so heavy sometimes, so full that it flows and pours and
gives. Yet, the weight becomes so stressful to another party that it
becomes the reason of its end.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So the la la land, is a land of regrets, is a land of nights that the
only way to go through it is to forget, to look back, to write, to
cry.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I'm scared now. I cant do this anymore. La la land, pls let me go.&lt;/p&gt;</content><category term="thoughts"></category><category term="love"></category></entry><entry><title>Prototype needed</title><link href="https://fengxia41103.github.io/myblog/thoughts-on-prototype.html" rel="alternate"></link><published>2016-09-01T15:10:00-04:00</published><updated>2016-09-01T15:10:00-04:00</updated><author><name>Feng Xia</name></author><id>tag:fengxia41103.github.io,2016-09-01:/myblog/thoughts-on-prototype.html</id><summary type="html">&lt;p&gt;Building a prototype is a must-have for any new project
and new business idea. It is not only a way to test out
the initial thoughts so we know it is feasible, it also builds a
common platform for client and developers to communicate while they
are looking at the same thing.&lt;/p&gt;</summary><content type="html">&lt;figure class="col l6 m6 s12 center"&gt;
  &lt;img src="images/20150930_transporter.png"
       class="img-responsive"/&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I believe in the power of prototypes.  That is to say, I want to see
an idea in action before I feel comfortable of its existence and the
soundness its being. A few years back when I first started a career as
engineer, I learned a valuable lesson.  After making modifications
based on a requirement and checked code into SourceSafe (a Microsoft
source control product), I thought all was well, until a senior team
member called on me.  Part of his job was to mentor and supervise my
work.  He asked to review the change. So we sat down side by side. I
showed him and he said it was a good job. Then he said,"Not that I
don't trust you. It's just my thing that I need to see things with my
own eyes in order to believe."&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Fast forward to now, after 20 years doing software development and
project management, I am leaning more and more towards this "seeing
things with my own eyes" mentality. Maybe it is an age thing. But
considering the complexity of a software application these days and
the precision it requires, being conservative is a good trait.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Prototype, or proof-of-concept (POC), is a wonderful thing. In my
opinion it serves four important functions:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class="myhighlight"&gt;It proves the concept&lt;/span&gt;.
Nothing is more valuable than knowing
the path in mind is not a dead end. This applies in particular to
those projects that have large share of uncertainties. Taking
a trip to Mars is not mind-boggling if you know your friend
John has just traveled there and back. But if you were the first
one sent to Mars, oh boy.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class="myhighlight"&gt;It formulates a design&lt;/span&gt;.
Over the process of building a prototype, key
components will be researched, evaluated, adopted,
developed, integrated and tested. System boundaries will emerge. Key
functions and services will be grouped into at least three tiers:
low-hanging fruits, hard but do-ables, and dont-know-hows.
This knowledge, in turn,  will drive task
priorities, task estimation, and risk evaluation.
All these will become a cornerstone of the system design so it will be
practical, executable, and working.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class="myhighlight"&gt;It builds communication&lt;/span&gt;.
Building prototypes involves lots of
discussions. Clients brain dumps their expectations to dev team, while
dev team internalizes those business functions into
a coherent picture illustrated using their familiar technology jargon.
Details that hold importance but have been neglected will be discovered
and ironed out. A common knowledge base
and a common vocabulary will be built over the course. Instead of
business syntax on one side (requirements)
while some technology jargon on
the other (SQL? Queue?), we now have a vocabulary that all
could understand, contribute, and use to effectively communicate.
This reminds me a strategy by Starbucks. Their staff will repeat
a customer's order in a particular sequence:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Hot or iced.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Size.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Decaf.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Number of shots (if any extra)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Number of pumps of syrup (if you're that specific)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Type of milk.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Any extras (mo' whip, mo' deliciousness)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Drink type (latte, Frappuccino, etc.)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Why do they do that? To build a common a vocabulary and
to improve communication. The result, less error and happier customer.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class="myhighlight"&gt;It removes risks&lt;/span&gt;. Hiccups will be discovered early
on in the game; workarounds will be put in place; strategies
will be clarified; team knowledge will be shared; and collaboration
will be formed and adapted. Let's put it this way: if a POC
did not work out, whether it be because of technical challenge
or organizational barrier, the full-blown project is not gonna succeed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So next time you have an exciting idea that will dominate the world,
take that drawing on napkin to build a prototype, because as the old saying,
seeing is believing.&lt;/p&gt;</content><category term="thoughts"></category><category term="dev"></category><category term="design"></category></entry></feed>
