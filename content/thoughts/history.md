Reading [The rape of the Nile][1], quite a fascinating book.
It's rather surprising how recent these events were &mdash;
we are talking about the mid-19th century, what, about 150 years ago?
In prospective, the history of Egypt and its glorious monuments have
been around for much longer than that.

# reality of the past

What really bothers me, however, is how the people at those days were
treating these ancient artifacts back then &mdash; just like the
horror propaganda I have been told about China's treasure being looted
and trashed by barbarians of both foreign and domestic origin (and
admittedly much more by the domestic ones), the same theme of sadness
was playing in Egypt, over and over and over again. Pyramids were used
for quarrying building materials, and artifacts were given as a token
to influential whoever the ruler was trying to please. At the end of
the day, no one was looking at them as arts of unreplaceable
value. They were free gifts left over by ancient anonymous &mdash;
cheap as dirt, and only meaningful to one when it could bring glory,
fame, profit, or the things s/he wants at that given moment. There was
no perpetual value, no inherited value, certainly no emotional value
worth preservation, and much less of responsible value by making them
available for the generations to come &rarr; consume and dispose them
now, by me, period.

# "unfairness", in a hindsight

But then, if you feel it is clear now to see how terrible those deeds
were, I kept wondering how to justify this view when I'm really
reading all these from a distant **present**, or to say looking from a
rear view mirror. I hold a different prospective than those in the
book at the time. You can call it a progress of civilization as we are
now understanding more of its history (since no one was even able to
read the Egyptian words till the [Rosetta stone][2], and even that
took a few decades before it was deciphered), thus its importance and
value. But does it state that it's not fair to those people we call
_barbarians_ these days since they were really operating in a
disadvantage comparing to what we know today? Well, then why being
_fair_ is a measure of good or bad anyway? who said it must be _fair_?
If you throw these out, then how does one look at so called
**history** and opinionate it one way or the other? After all, each
holds his own life experience as the only foundation he could relate
and refer to. So it becomes a completely random chance that someone's
reference happens to match the one that later gets realized 
and is labelled as a **human progress**, which then leads them
standing out as the pioneer and a great mind, while in reality, who
the heck know what it is going to be tomorrow!? 

# right of the advanced

Further, when western museums were the buyer who drove all the tomb
robbers and antique traders, the sad reality back then was that local
folks didn't give a fxxx of all the mummies and monuments. So now fast
forward 150 years, it is just not reasonable
to *blame** them for collecting them in the name of `loot`
or `steal`. Their argument is valid &mdash; the antiques did have a
better chance to be preserved and to survive, and they did have a
better vision (if can be called enlightened) of the future than
others. But this leads to another dilemma.

Does it then mean that a so called _advanced_ group or society should
be in position to take over things from a _less advanced_ group so to
maximize the overall benefits of, what, society? human race?
history?... I don't find a word to describe this. But you see what I'm
driving towards right? This argument definitely feels, not right
morally, but right factually. Let's say we let them do that, and the
future proves they were right &larr; both of these are pretty
**SIGNIFICANT** assumptions. But does it mean that the less advanced
group will be locked in their inferior position/class forever? If I
enjoy the benefit of taking over others' stuff, what incentive do I
have to educate them and lift them up out of their existence so to
_compete_ with me!? Isn't this the exact thought any privileged
subject has and wish to maintain, forever!? So the elites rule us all,
because even you are the _privileged_ one, chances are you are not the 
single top guy of the food chain, then by this reasoning it derives
that you will also be ruled, crashed, bullied, and wasted, maybe just
with a slight less degree of destruction, but the idea is the
same. Well, then why do you want to promote that!?

# history === myth

How confusing! I think this whole mess of arguments really lead to the
problem that there is no _compass_ in my life these days and the line
between right and wrong is completely blurred (or just disappeared). 
I lost faith in the future, has serious contempt of the present, and
has a shaky feeling of the past. [Santayana][3] warned that "
Those who do not learn history are doomed to repeat it." But what you
learned from history isn't really a truth or even fact, but a
hindsight of judgement which itself could just be a complete wrong
in the next few decades because of the prospective shift. Then, what
could one really learn from so called history, if anything?

马未都说："历史没有真相，只残存一个道理". Now even this seems over
optimistic. There isn't even a 道理, just a story, a legend,
a myth. So to this point, history doesn't really matter much, nor it
has any value in anything. Its left over artifacts are valuable, when
they have a market (which means someone wants it for $$). If no one
wants it, oh well, they are just a whole pile of dirt regardless what
they are named, mummy, gold, or whatever.

# "Epilogue"

I am quoting the "epilogue" chapter of [the book][1], which I feel draw a clear
picture of paradox of history that barbarians whom we so disgust
today, who looted the Niles with selfish motivation ONLY,
in the end became the driving force, though brutal and even
uncivilized judged by these days' standars, 
created a repository of treasure, even unintentionally, so
we living in this century still have some to look at and to admire. If
left to the _rightful owner_ of them (the locals, but who said they
have the right?), many we see today would have been
long gone, consumed as a trivial heating bundle in winter and
supersititious medicine, whose usage and purpose we could scorn even
more I suppose, comparing to their dark fate of being moved from their
origin to a foreign location as monument, as cash machine, as a ladder
to fame and fortune for some, but in the end, as an inheritage of mankind.

Over a hundred and fifty years have passed since Giovanni Belzoni
shook the dust of Alexandria off his feed for the last time. But many
familiar scenes would greet his eyes if he were to return to the Nile
today. The pyramids still tower above the floodplain, while the Sphinx
crouches at their feed surrounded by curious tourists. The sun still
rises in a gray dawn, lights up the vast spaces of the desert, and
highlights the fertile green and cultivated land by the banks of the
Nile. The shimmering heat of midday embraces the heavy air of temple
and royal bomb in the same way that it has for centuries. White-sailed
river vessels retrace the course taken by Belzoni's ramshackle boats
and pass the scenes of this greatest exploits. There is a sense of
timelessness about the Nile that transcends the passage of years or
the stirring events of history. The visitor to the Nile can smell the
same smells as the Ancient Egyptians, of hot dust and damp reeds, of
the river itself as it flows smoothly toward the north. Every year,
like clockwork, the Nile comes down in flood, ensuring the fertility
of crops and perpetuating agricultural practices that are often little
modified from pharaonic times. One can almost sense that elusive
feeling of equilibrium and ma&prime;et, that sense of rightness so
highly prized by the Ancient Egyptians as they identified with their
unchanging environment.

Belzoni had come to the Nile at a time when the full extend of the
glories of Ancient Egypt had just been revealed to the world for the
first time. The coolections of Napoleon's savants had electrified the
scholars of Europe and a craze for things Egyptian had swept the
cultivated drawing rooms of European capitals. The Rosetta Stone had
reached the British Museum; the Louvre in Paris had just unpacked its
spoils from the Nile. A surge of nationalistic lust for the precious
and exotic was filling these museums and those in other countries with
all manner of curiosities and the finest artistic achievements of
Western civilization. And Egyptian antiquities were at the top of the
curators' shopping lists. Thus the scramble for Ancient Egypt began, a
campaign of looting conducted in the name of diplomacy and leisured
cultural inquiry, which soon degenerated into an orgy of destruction,
greed, and outright profiteering. As in other parts of the world,
archaeology began as treasure hunting and then slowly evolved into a
scientific discipline armed with all the specialist methods and
techniques of the twentieth-century fieldworker. But by the time the
scientific archaeologist arrived, much of the Ancient Egypt was gone
forever, devoured by the voracious maw of the treasure hunter,
unscrupulous collection, or curious tourist.

Napoleon's mena were only human in their desire to collect Egyptian
antiquities, for the urge to collect and posses is one of the more
passionate of human desires. Time and time again the early
archaeologist was overcome with a passion to excavate, loot, or just
remove the past to another place, where he could caress it and
contemplate its glories without the disturbing qualities of its
original context. Soon European antionalism and the petty ambitions of
dislomats and statesmen became involve in the collecting business, as
many nations sought to acquire a fine repository of the most
beautiful, exotic, and valuable manifestations of Ancient Egyptian
civilization. It became fashionable to be knowledgeable about Ancient
Egyptin all its nostalgic and fascinating glory. Egypt was the epitome
of ancient civilization, that of a strong and powerful society that
had oppressed the Israelities, suffered from the Mosaic plagues, and
taken a conspicuous place in the established order of world
history. Unfortunately, knowledge coincided with ownership and profit
in many people's minds.

In a sense one cannnot blame the museum curator or collector of a
century and a half ago for the attitudes that they
possessed. Everywhere they looked they saw statuary and temples being
broken up and tombs being looted for jewelry. In Egypt nothing was
safe. But a papyrus carefully unrolled in the secluded comfort of the
British Museum was safe from destruction, cushioned with the awesome
security of the greates museum in the world. After all, as Wallis
Budge pointedly remarked, a mummy displayed in the British Museum was
very priuvileged compared with his cousins in the looted tombs of
Thebes. No on could desecrate a British Museum mummy or tear it
apart. The outrageous tactics of private purchase and surreptitious
excavation in definance of authority were condoned in the comfortable
certainty that they were the only practicable way to save Ancient
Egypt from extinction. What need, asked many people, did the Egyptians
have for their past? After all, the pasha's government was destroying
and giving it away all the time. And the fellahin seemed to have no
respected for tomb or temple or any identity with the Ancient
Egyptians themselves, only in the value of their corpses. There was
non of the local nationalistic sentiment that had stirred vigorous
public outcry in Greece when Lord Elgin removed the marble friezes
that bear his name in the British Museum from the portico of the
Parthenon. The well-heeled museum collection and tourist of a century
and a half ago was fully aware that the Ancient Egyptians themselves
had helped themselves to the contents of royal tombs. They had
viuolated their most sacred places and the royal sepulchers for gold
and a guaranteed source of wealth that would enable them to meet
life's day-to-to needs. The ancients had treated the past with a
causal cynicism that had been inherited by their successors, a
cynicism that was mathed with equal contempt by the nineteenth-century
collector. It is a miracle that anything at all has survived for us to enjoy.
