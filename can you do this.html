<p>The 1:1 meeting went pretty badly. Over the last 4 years I had been
working w/ this team and this person, and I'm having serious doubt of
the upcoming <em>new initiative</em>. So feeling compelled I spoke up (yeah I
know, I tried to silent myself for a few weeks. But this is against my
view of integrity, really, by watching the rain derail without
sounding an alarm). But you know what? Negative message is never
welcomed, when there is a <em>positive</em> one that is the mainstream. So
the conversation went like this:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>A: "I need to see daily progress. If that is not happening, then
something is wrong and we should review it." (this is perfectly
reasonable).</p>
<p>Me: "I'm hesitating to promise such daily progress. Let me ask you
this. When was the last time you followed someone's blog to get the
result it says? In my experience it never happened. You copied and
pasted, and it didn't work. So you googled and found some other posts,
and out of some trials and with some luck, it worked."</p>
<p>A: "Then you must have been using the wrong blog."</p>
<p>Me: "(pause) That's the million dollar question, right? How do I know
it is the wrong blog?"</p>
<p>A: "Look. Basically I need someone who can do it. If you don't think
you can, then I need to find someone who can."</p>
<p>Me: "(long pause) If there are other things to do, then I probably
should do those instead of doing this project."</p>
<p>A: (to smoothe the blow) "Yeah there are others"
</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I felt really bad that evening.</p>
<p>I consider myself quite a <em>can do</em> person. I have done more than the
job has asked, and has been always on the lookout to help the team not
to blow too badly. Yet here it is, I'm the one who <em>can't do</em> it, not
to mention I feel I'm letting his down when he needs someone to do
this.</p>
<p>But then, how do I reconcile w/ the view which I totally disagree!?
Should I speak up? or should I not?</p>
<h1>if you can't, move aside</h1>
<p>I have heard this before, in China. Too many times, this is a catch
all phrase thrown at people who really know what he is doing, by
someone who doesn't, but having the authority to say so. The common
cliche is, of course, that this person might possess some <em>unknown</em>
information, thus if he is asking you to do it, you should just bow
and do it.</p>
<p>But, I'm sorry. My experience has been different. I'm not stupid, and
I don't consider this information asymmetry is even healthy (see <a href="https://fengxia41103.github.io/myblog/domain knowledge.html">this
blog</a>). This is the exact thing that people use to maintain power,
and it is poisonous! Asking me to do something without an explanation
is completly bizzare, because that's essentially the same logic that
you are guilty until you are proven innocent, and btw, you need to
prove it yourself. So collect the evidence and present to me, and if I
agree, you are innocent. Fxxx you.</p>
<p>This is outrageous! BS! If you want me to do something, explain your
case first. And, since you are not gonna do it yourself, thus you are
asking me to do it, better respect my opinion when I say No! Period. I
know better, don't I? Otherwise, I would simply say, do it yourself.</p>
<p>The saying of "if you can't do it, I will find someone who can" is an
outright bully &mdash; "go for it" I would say. If you can find
someone who likes to bow his/her head, agree with your view, go for
it. Really. I don't need it, and I don't want it, and I hold on my
view based on my judgment, and that is that. Especially I spoke with
my full good conscience thinking the situation is wrong. So if you
don't like it, too bad.</p>
<p>I know there are many bosses out there who just want to "get things
done". I get it. But if you don't know what the done is, or can tell a
good one form a bad one, you are exposing yourself to all sorts of BS,
that at the end of day, yourself will suffer. I'm sicken tired of
hearing the high-profile talks in these days' meetings where the
talker has not even the basic training in software development, nor
the specific domain the product is built upon. So, how can they
shameless talk about the next moon landing project without feeling a
bit of hesitation when an engineer raises his hand "Sir, but this is
not a good idea"?</p>
<p>I feel really frustrated by how things are being conducted here. I
suppose all companies are similar. But honestly, I never expect it can
get this far. The analogy I constantly think of is that being a foot
solider, when generals are ignorant and make mistake, soldiers die in
vain. </p>
<p>That's what is happening in front of my eye.</p></p>
