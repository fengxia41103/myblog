    <h1 class="myhighlight">Data, Integrity</h1>
  </div>

  <ol id="toc" class="row"></ol>

  <div>
    <div id="article-content">
      <p><p>The first time reading <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Trust-Social-Virtues-Creation-Prosperity/dp/0684825252">"Trust"</a> by <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Francis_Fukuyama">Francis Fukuyama</a>, I was
deeply impressed by his distinction that Chinese trust is implied,
such as inner circle of immediate family, friends, extended through
marriage... while the Western version is explicit, for example, the
credit score system.</p>
<h1>Now we have data</h1>
<figure class="col l8 m12 s12 center">
  <img src="images/data%20and%20love.png"/>
</figure>

<p>With China's economy boom and in particular the ever thirsty
interest by the mass of any kind of financial leverage, the only
barrier everyone agrees upon that is holding the lenders back to lend
more and borrowers back to borrow more, is the lack of a personal credit
score. <span class="myhighlight">How wonderful the world is going to
be if only everyone has a credit score!</span> even better, if that
score is tracked and publicized and supervised and distilled by the
almighty government, isn't it just a paradise on earth?</p>
<p>Is it!?</p>
<p>The concept is very enticing. This score, like what we have in the US,
will hinder you from doing bad things, breaking laws, defaulting
loans, dodging tax, and even being on welfare for too long &mdash; it
is a force to stop your sin and encourage your virtue. You are
rewarded for your good, and punished for you bad. Common sense.</p>
<p>But China, what a magical land, just possess this infinite creativity to
turn anything upside down. If 取其精华，去其糟粕
is a wisdom of how to learn new things, in practice the "smart"
Chinese is doing the exact opposite. </p>
<p>When I grew up in the 80s and early 90s, the main stream was filled
with news and articles and classroom materials that were nearly 100%
qualitative with little quantitative analysis to back up
their statements. Legend from the dark age of the 60s and 70s was that
data was manufactured <strong>on demand</strong> to serve a purpose, often
political, therefore reflected little reality. Trained as an engineer
and a believer in <em>science</em>, I found it ridiculous and felt sad about
ppl who had to live with those lies.</p>
<p>So things got really better in the past 10 years. Everywhere you turn,
there is data, charts, Excel, application... and then the buzz &mdash;
big data, data this, data that... if you can not include the word "data"
in your sentence, you are just out, out of fashion, out of mind, and
out of a trustworthy circle. What a turn! But that's exactly the part
that annoys me.</p>
<p>When you speak of data, when everything is data-driven, when any
argument is now backed by some table, curve, statistics, when no data
is too big and everyone thinks data holds the magic to solve <strong>any</strong>
problem, do they know that this is the golden age of going digital,
but the worse time for <strong>trust</strong>!? I read an article today that
Alibaba installed a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sesame_Credit">Sasame credit</a> as a hope to lead the way to
introduce credit score in everyone's life. However, you can pay some
total stranger $70 to get a perfect score using his/her manufactured
data (maybe someone else's data, who knows). </p>
<h1>Data integrity</h1>
<p>This isn't even ironic. This is fucked up. Most common reaction I
believe is that things will be different if government is running this
instead of a private commercial entity. And I'll argue that not only
it will not make a difference, but it will be a terrible idea. Who is
supervising the government!? Why is it trustworthy, at all!? What
happens when it installs some BS like this <a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/chinas-new-tool-for-social-control-a-credit-rating-for-everything-1480351590">social credit score</a>
with probably all the noble intention, but in the end became a lawless
tool in government's hand to crush whoever it feels like!? Tell me,
how to prevent that from happening besides praying for its
conscience!? Come on.</p>
<p>But my point isn't about politics at all. The root cause of this is
not some bad apples who want to outsmart the system to make profit. It
will always happen. It's human nature. The problem, is <span
class="myhighlgiht">people fail to understand data itself means
nothing, absolutely nothing, if it loses integrity</span>. The credit
score itself is the icing; the way to collect, process, cross-check to
verify and validate these data, is the core that creates "trust".</p>
<p>When clients want to build a system, the only principle he needs to
understand is <strong>garbage in, garbage out</strong>. System is not smart. Data
is not smart. Data generator, whoever that is, is smart. The power of a
system is not at accumulating data; it's the ability to <span
class="myhighlight">define and guard</span> data integrity. Period.</p>
<p>How to achieve that? Defining integrity is the job of human. It is
domain specific and context sensitive. The analogy is that user agrees
1 plus 1 equals 2. Then data's job is make sure everywhere there is 1
plus 1, it flags it green if it equals 2, and flags red otherwise. </p>
<h1>Trust, but verify</h1>
<p>How to guard integrity? Cross checking. I love President Reagan's
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trust,_but_verify">trust, but verify</a>. How do you know your data is correct? Looking
at them in multiple dimensions see if the result is
<strong>consistent</strong>. Remember, garbage in, garbage out. This is literally a
mental race between the system implementor and data manipulators. The
cheapest, and also the most effective, way is to feed you garbage at
the first place, and that's what's happening to this Seseame score.</p>
<p>So my complaint is that people pick up an idea or a buzz word without
looking further to its assumption, and rush to market it as if it's
another silver bullet. The assumption is really what matters. For
credit score, or any other data driven application/idea/concept, the
data integrity is the assumption. It takes tremendous insight into the
subject at hand, and a lot of disciplines to verify. Then and only
then, it can create trust.</p></p>
