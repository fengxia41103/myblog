I just had a thought &mdash; many mid-age women claim that they feel
the best of themselves in this age band because they are independent,
self-sufficient, less anxious, not that they have fewer troubles in
life, but they view them as a matter-of-fact, just deal with it when
it comes.

On one hand, the cliche is always that mid-age is a tough time because
we have fewer choices now than when we were young, but much more
obligation/responsibilities to fulfill, family, kids, parents, and so
on. Therefore there are many of the "I have to" scenarios, part of it
that it becomes a convenient execuse to do the things you want and to
dodge the things you don't like; on the other hand they do feel that
you have to do them because you are aware that alternatives (not
like before that you simply don't know what the alternative path can
lead to, thus were feeling hopeful because you didn't know better), if
any, is not that pretty and easy either. So might as well _force
through_ on this same path, of which at least you know some about. So
there is marriage that people hold on to, not that they like it, but
they feel they have to (until another **perfect candidate** shows up
in hour life), the job you have to go to everyday (and all jobs are
not fun and easy, and mingle with a new team, new environment,
essentially a new social group, is not only very tiring, but quite
scary.).....

So literature, talks, movies, TVs, all depict a mid-life crisis when
these inevitable tasks crash on you, probably in a blow-up fashion
(when all the misfortunes happen at once), and honestly, the blow-up
fashion is the probably the only possible fashion this will play out,
because the original so called "balance" is so fragile that any
deviation will cause it to &rarr; CRASH! So we keep tittering by the
edge of a cliff, trying not to look down, not to fall, to fool the
mind that the cliff does not exist, to look for even a grass to grab,
thinking that at least it will create some resistance when gravity
kicks in &larr; maybe it will slow down the fall? maybe it is just
strong enough to hold me?.... in sum, we want a sense of security, but
it feels like an impossible goal.

But then, why women in their 40s feel so good about themselves? and
even for myself, I feel so much, more sure about myself than ever, not
because of the skills I have or the job or the status. I mean, if
measured by any of these dimensions I'm an absolute loser in any
common sense and categories. No. I started to feel "sure" about myself
because now I'm angrier these day, which then translate to that I
constantly feel that I don't care much about the surroundings, other
people's views or opinions, anymore. Noah, like me, is keenly
sensitive of people around, and gets influenced easily. Siqi, probably
the same, when she said she is a like a mirror merely reflecting the
people around her. I wonder this is an attribute of smartness &larr;
because you are smart, your mind is that much perceptive to things and
people, so you, if viewed as a machine, acquires a much greater amount
of information that it feeds your powerful brain to process to keep it
busy, then in return you feel more, know more, think more, thun wiser
and smarter, than those who don't &mdash; a perfect, positive,
feedback loop!

So when I don't pay attention to others anymore, does it then make me
dumb, in the end, because I cut off the feedback loop now? Actually I
would say no. Sometimes I feel I'm simply turning inward more, so I
still sense these things, think/process, but it becomes an
entertainment for myself, a show without an audience, versus when I
was younger the best time is when there is an audience who
applauds. No, audience is not needed anymore. I think that makes a
difference. This leads to that since I don't seek for approval by
others, things you do, or not do, becomes solely your own decision
&mdash; you do it because you enjoy some part of it, no one forces you
to. Alternatives are many. The reason you didn't take them is not that
you have to do this one, but you have made a choice for yourself. And
even for alternatives, I sometimes think I know too many alternatives,
which makes choice difficult (aren't we all fear the cost of
opportunity?). If only God has laid one path in front of you, and you
have no choice but this one! 

For young folks, alternatives were few, due mostly to their limited
life experience (at one point I firmly believed that going to college,
getting married, having a kid, is THE ONLY GOOD PATH I should
take). As many of them look quite promising, because, they seem to
solve the current problem. Well, they might do solve your problem, but
they also come with theirs, just different ones, and devils are in the
details, they only look easier than what you have because, you haven't
been there yet. Once you take a few steps on that alternative path,
boy, isn't this one hard!

So this is what life has taught me &mdash; there is no silver
bullet. Everything comes with a set of good things and bad
things. Making decision or choosing alternative is simply swapping one
set of these goods and bads with another. No difference (well, there
is I have to say, because Siqi is such a wonderful, beautiful, person,
of mind & soul.) Therefore, I feel relieved at this age, that there
isn't anything I **have to**. No. There are many I can choose from,
because it's all about whether I'm willing to take that path or not.

I think this explains why these 40ish women feel relieved, and I think
it's the right feeling to have. We in our 40s have less possibilities,
but abundant alternatives. What's lacking is will, but that's not an
age thing. It's more of a personal attribute, some have it, some
don't. It can be labled as risk taking, or being conservative, or
being a responsible, or just being satisfied with what you have
(what-is-happiness kind of talk).... whatever it is called, I want to
make it clear, that **it's a decision you are making, there is no
"I have to", there is only "I do"**.
