Doesn't the title sound like a tongue twister? That's where the irony
is. How can you make a response **irresponsible**? and what does it
give? Any harm done? Does it matter? What does it mean when it
happens? Why do ppl give such response? and why would ppl accept them?
or do they?

# The play

The whole thing started one morning when I was sitting in this noodle
shop eating breakfast. A woman walked in and ordered a fried dish. 


> Cashier girl: This dish needs wait.  
> Woman: Oh, how long would that be?  
> Cashier girl: They just started cooking them.

The conversation ended there. Strange! well, at least to my ears, this
is really really strange, and frustrating, and maddening, and is the
root cause of everything that you don't like about this society, this
country, this life. Really.


The woman was certainly not satisfied with the response. However, she
didn't pursue. Obviously she asked the question because she wanted to
decide whether she wanted to wait for this dish (if wait time is
acceptable to her) or switch do a different one. The cashier girl,
however, was completely content with her response and felt nothing was
wrong with the conversation. As a matter of fact, this so called <span
class="myhighlight">chinese ambiguity</span> is highly praised,
sometimes, by ppl who genuinely feel that's the art of the Chinese
language, the Chinese culture, the Chinese way. Well, you know what?
That's totally BS.

Because if you think of the root of a question, you don't ask a
question like this for pleasure and to kill time. With the context of
the scene, apparently the question was information seeking so that the
woman can make a decisioin &mdash; wait for this, or not. We have all
learned in 2nd grade (or experience with learning another language)
what is the __proper__ way to answer a question. 

> **Q**: Does the train leave at 5?  
> **A**: No, the train is running late. It will probably leave at 5:10.

But the cashier girl's answer, on the other hand, convey <span
class="myhighlight">zero</span> information to help the decision
making. Instead, she not only dodged the bullet, but throw the ball
back to the woman and put her brain on a spin now:

> Woman: If it just started, how long does it usually take? Five
> minutes? Maybe I can wait. But what if it takes longer than that, I
> could instead get the other one, then I'll be home sooner so I can
> feed my cats. They must be hungry by now. But I wanted a taste of
> this dish, if only it won't take too long.....

# The pattern

By the end of the day, she still doesn't know how long she will wait,
and she could only make her move based on what I call <span
class="myhighlight">blind assumption</span>. Doesn't this phrase sound
familiar? Yes, 拍脑袋做决定. So many times at work Chinese clients and
colleagues complained about authority making decisions without having
a good understanding of the problem, and the decisions then led to the
misery that they were suffering from &mdash; failures of the project, poor
quality of the product, and disrespect by management against their
profession.

But have they ever taken a step back and ask themselves, have they
given the response like the cashier girl's? In a recent project,
the company canceled a project after months of effort. I asked the
Chinese colleague for a clue, and the answer was that marketing and
sales actually voiced against this project at the very beginning, but
the R&D in US **didn't get the implied message**. So the marketing and
sales threw up their hands in the air, just like that girl &mdash; I
warned you, so whatever you end up with is not my responsibility
anymore. To make the explanation sound sophisticated, they added
that "you know, it's the Chinese way. We can understand the message
well, but they didn't get it." How wonderful. It's cultural, it's
language, it's you, silly.

This is exactly the same pattern, isn't it?  So why didn't she give
the straight answer? After all, she is the one who works there so she
was in position to estimate an average wait time better than anyone
random customer. And even more ironic was that she started the warning
that "you need to wait for this dish", but then shunned the
question. Why?  One word, <span
class="myhighlight">responsibility</span>.

1. **The warning** was not raised to help the customer. Instead, it
   was habitually said to offload responsibility &mdash; I have warned
   you, therefore any negative result was not my problem anymore. How
   witty but totally disgusting!?
2. **The answer**. Needless to say, she made a superficial response
   without even addressing the face value of the question. Service?
   what service? They always say __putting yourself in customer's
   shoes__. That's what service is about.  A service orientated spirit
   will make her actively __anticipate__ customer's underline anxiety
   &larr; She was apparently on a hurry. Why so? How long would she be
   willing to wait? Could I recommend something else to help her
   situation? &rarr; you see, this will lead to many follow up questions,
   if she was there to <span class="myhighlight">serve</span>
   the customer, not just being a human cash register.

To me, the bare minimum she could have said was **I don't know. Chef
would know that.** and if taking one step further, she could ask the
chef on behalf.  Well, she didn't do any of these because this
requires a few more rounds of interaction, an information seeking on
behalf the customer, and taking a responsibility of the message said:

>Cashier girl: They just started cooking. It usually takes 5-6
> minutes. You can also try our xyz which also tastes good and is
> ready now.

# The courage

Yes, making straight answer takes guts. You say what you mean, and you
mean what you say. You stand behind your statement with a sense of
responsibility that you take pride and not afraid of being proven
wrong. More than this, you make those statement because you are
actively engaging the customer to understand their needs, did homework
so you have a fair confidence in your recommendation, and make
those recommendation in order to make their life better through your
service. 

It is easy to play the word game that gets you off the hook. <span
class="myhighlight">But please, stop dressing it up with the Chinese
culture, the Chinese language, the Chinese
characteristic</span>. There is nothing to be proud of in this sense,
because that type of response is **not only irresponsible, but a
complete waste of life** &mdash; at the end of that conversation, the
woman knew nothing new, and girl knew nothing new either. Next
customer who wanted to know the wait time for this dish, same
ignorance, or same safe answer. The conversation might as well never
happened from both parties' point of view.

And the cashier girl felt great, until she walked out her restaurant and met
with all the other irresponsible responses threw at her by others,
unconsciously as she did, and helped nothing with her decision makings
in life. 

Well, if only one can live without making decisions. But, isn't
everyday filled with nothing but million decisions to make? That's
life. So next time, remind yourself, give straight answer, even it is
a "I don't know". I don't believe the beauty of the Chinese language
lies in its low efficiency, and there is a difference between <span
class="myhighlight">I didn't get the message vs. you didn't tell
me</span>.

Implication? You know there is another name for it &mdash; up for
interpretation. It's fun, until it blows up. 

> Q: Help! I need help! I'm shot...
> 
> 911: I'm on my way! Will be there 5 minutes. Calm down, keep
> pressure on the wound, take deep breath....

Yes, make straight answer, clear instruction, think, I mean really
think, for your customer. Your service isn't there because there is a
position called XYZ. It's there to help ppl, so next time, put a
bit of yourself into it. Responsibility doesn't kill you. It makes you
brave, proud, and respectful.
