Hard to believe, the guy is 10 years old now. I can still feel the
day, the day that he was coming to this world, and the day it was a
hot summer day, and I was biking between hospital and home. He came at
1pm, the same time when my brother passed away. I joked that he was
him reborn into this family. This gave my moom, and everyone in the
family, a comfort, that he is back to us again, in Noah's body, and
will be loved and cherished and spoiled, as if it is a second chance
for everybody, like a lost, found.

I wanted to believe that myself, too. I missed Lei. It is becoming
less frequent now that I will think of him. But he is still there. I
wish there were more I could have done at the time, to ease his
pain. I wish I had been more mature, more independent, and more
thoughtful, and more wise perhaps, to know what to do, and to do what
is well, and right. Yet, time is indeed a passing river, never stops
for anyone, for any soul... how funny this is! that **time** is purely
a human invention, yet, we are so at the mercy of it, that we could
only look at it with a deep sigh, and nothing, absolutely nothing, we
can do about it.

I told Noah many times that there are many things I can help him with,
but there is one thing nobody can give him more, and that is time. I
was saying so to get him some sense of time. But it is true. Time
flies, life is like a summer, with a flash, the summer of life is
gone. I start to feel the age, start to see that the summer of my life
is at its end, and it does feel rather sad. Then, here is Noah, double
digit now, and this summer has felt really short. People say time
starts to accelerate once kids are growing up. If only, that mine
would stand still, then let theirs go by as quickly as they will,
turning 10 is a big deal I think, because he is now a teen, and he
starts to have a lot of thought of him own these day.

He is really funny sometimes. So big guy, happy birthday! I don't know
how long I can accompany you. It's God's will, so I wouldn't guess. So
far, I have enjoyed you very much. Though there are endless headaches,
and frustrations, and such. I wouldn't say it's all worth it; it's all
part of you, and I start to accept them, as they are, and I do love
you and care about you very much, as you are.
