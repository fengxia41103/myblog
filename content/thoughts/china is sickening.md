This news hit me. As a father w/ my son at the same age as these
girls, I felt very sad. I can not imagine how I would take such a
thing if it happened on Noah. The center of my universe would have
collapsed, and there is nothing left for me to hold on in this world,
this life. If I ever survived such a blow, I would nothing but a
walking zombie without emotion but hatred, of myself, of the harsh
things I have done to Noah when he was little, of his requests which I
failed to meet, of moments I didn't choose to be with him... regret
will be like a virus eating my heart from inside out until a death
would look like a much better option than breathing.

Sad.

I feel this anger inside me, like cloud rising. I'll be a coward,
perhaps, just like the parents who were waiting in the hospital while
_under control_ of those authorities. But I can't. I'll feel such an
urge to attack, to grab his fxxk neck and go into a fight, so that
it's better than suffering the misery of being powerless to save. How
familiar it is when they were asked to sign a paper of death before
they could look at their children even for identification
purpose. Isn't this the same, regular, standard move when I was asked
to sign dad's paper? I remember that. I hate, not the puppet sent by the
bureaucracy, but the bureaucracy itself, the 院长 who is a coward... I
guess, in the end, I hate cowardice, in myself and in others.

Chapel Hill had a bad fire this weekend. Noah and I went to the
scene. When I couldn't find him for a while, I felt nearly a panic
strike. But after I remember the kid said to me before he asked to run
ahead by himself to the scene:"I want to go and check what I could
help." At the time I warned him to stay away from the scene, certainly
the idea, because I don't him to be unsafe. But, now writing this when
all these have passed, I feel proud of him &mdash; it's a noble first
instinct. When someday he were the one stepping forward to shoulder a
tough burden, I wouldn't be surprised. I will feel very sad if he is
harmed, but I would always feel proud that he were not a coward.

China, that piece of land, which I grew up, and felt to heart at some
point in my life, is now sickening. I can't imagine the policemen, who
is about in his 40s or 50s, could face another father losing his child
without feeling the pain. I won't be able to hold myself. Duty, isn't
the opposite of empathy. I would have given them a hug, tearing with
them, do what I can to bring dignity to them and the children. 一路走
好, is an empty phrase. I would rather say, keep your pride, know the
pain this has given to the livings, it's really tough. But also, know
their love will not disappear, whichever world you are.
