No kidding!!!! Earthquake!!! Wow. For the first time in life, and I'm
sincerely hoping this will be the last also, I experienced an
earthquake, and honestly, that was, scary!!

So while I was preparing breakfast, I heard this rattling sound from
my beloved Raaks shelf, then a sound of "stomp" coming from top, like
someone was running across the apartment upstairs. What the heck!? I
was thinking to myself, how could someone be running so heavily, and
how could it be so poor of sound insulation! But then, it didn't make
sense because the building is make of steel and concrete, and I
usually don't hear a soul while living here except the aisle door open
and close once a while. So how could it be!? So I reasoned that maybe
there is something wrong w/ my A/C that it was shutting down at the
time, thus making such a loud noise.

Ha! Untill I was then chatting w/ Ariel, and she said she just
received a notification of an earthquake in NC!! .... So then we
compared notes, and I now know for sure the rattling was caused by the
quake. Wow wow wow. What a sound it made! What a scary thing if one
thinks of it &mdash; what if the shelf collapses? what if the ceiling
collapses? I'll be dead, just dead. There is no way I could ever
survive those weight on top of me. Oh mine mine mine. Let's pray this
will not happen. Honestly, it's not fun.

Chatting w/ Ariel was initiated with something completly irrelevant w/
earthquake in mind. Saw a post on Huawei's announce of its running out
of chips, thus the next release will be the _final_ batch, and it made
it very, sentimental, as a hero finally lowers his head. Sad.

But.

This is disgusting! This is cheap, disgusting sales pitch taking
advantage of popular sentiments, but without ever reflecting the bias
it has been held and promoted since. Not only the lithography is only
a buzz word on their tongue, but it will not solve the problem at
all. If one hails Huawei's 5G technology as achievement, why do we at
the mean time trash the same kind of achievements by others!? Is there
now a Chinese physics vs. the rest of the world's!? Engineers are all
human. We have family to raise, health to take care, headaches to deal
with. What supports me to keep itching in technology, or work, or
life!? Not some grand ideal of national liberation, people happiness,
but just humble reason of making a living, doing a decent job, being
curious about new technologies, unsatisfied with current poor
solution, even some self arrogance that I'm smart and can think of a
**better solution** than this!

Engineering is universal, just like physics. There isn't different
gravity in China. A good engineering principle is applicable both here
and there. Without observing it and practicing it, it fails regardless
which geo it lives in. If Huawei has done a good job developing its
suite of technology, great! But that doesn't cancel out others'
achievements, which, in practical term, is far greater and more
impactful than Huawei's. 

This type of post is like a parasite &mdash;
it lives off a couple buzz words, but will only kill the host, not
making the host stronger. I have written about big data analysis, AI,
cloud computing, container, a few such buzz words popped up in the
last few years, and everytime, the same pattern was played out,
resulting in nothing but another in dumpster because "it is not trendy
anymore"! How sad! and how superficial! How pathetic!

Technology development is literally a course of trial-and-error,
almost randomly even, that the more you tried, the closer you may be
towards a working POC. There isn't a shortcut, and there isn't a
conspiracy. US may have censored chip, but there are too many other
weakness ready to be grabbed! Think of it. If github is blocked today,
can any of the existing system still operate, let alone bug fixing or
new feature!? Absolutely not! If it were banned today, China's
software development is back to the stone age instantly. None of the
code will compile anymore. Period. It's absolutely unthinkable if this
happened. 

The point is, technology is inter-dependent to the degree that no single
country can ever survive on its own anymore. It is mission
impossible. It's not a matter of $$, not a matter of national
pride. It's a fact, and a good fact actually &larr; again, if there is
only set of physics law governing this earth, stop thinking you will
be independent if only you had no foreign technology. It's a dead
end. The only way is to be a contributor, not to the West or the East
or whatever group name, but to humanity.

The China's world view of "either you are one of us, or you are one of
them", is not only harmful to itself, but harmful to raising a social
conscience that engineering is not meta science, but hard work, hard
thinking, no short cut, no 弯道超车， 半道超车， only respect to what
others have proven, and try to stand on giant's shoulder, to reach
higher.
