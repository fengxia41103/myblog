      <p><p>This has been a long past due as I have been thinking about this for
the last few days, and have attempted to write a letter a few times,
but always not feeling the <em>feel</em>, and when the feel was there I was
usually busy running around for things that is far less important but
more imminent. I think the actuality is that I don't know what to say
about it &mdash; on the day I submitted the paperworks, stepping
outside the course house building, nice warm sunny peaceful almost
cheering urban scene with pedestrians walking by and a few hovering
around as if they had all the time in this world, I sat down on the
metal garden bench, felt, I don't know, relieved? not really. ease
that something on to-do list is finally done? yes, some. sad? yes,
some, too.</p>
<p>But yes, I felt sad. I felt I was letting people down, without knowing
what's laying ahead, and knowing I have broken a vow that I casted
sincerely, whole-heartedly, believed, wanted, proud of, but now have
failed her, and myself, and the principle I have been preaching to
Noah, that don't make a promise that you can't keep, and I always
thought that is one thing I have held, and will hold true to myself,
to others who have come across and will come across my path, that I
can and will keep a promise I made &amp; make. </p>
<p>Yet, here I am, sitting here, and have broken THE promise I have made to a
person I loved, cared more than myself, at really not much of her own,
have turned into someone I now can not look straight into eyes when we
talk. So sad. Really. How could any vow be trustworthy anymore? how
could any promise be held to its end anymore? How could I have peace
with myself after I have betrayed the one thing I dear, and the one
person I deared, anymore?</p>
<div class="divider"></div>

<p>Hi,</p>
<p>This is a letter I have been wanting to write, for the last few days
at least, but don't know where to start or how to send. But let me
try.</p>
<p>I want to say, I am really really sorry, that it has finally come to
this. I feel sorry I have let you down, have let Noah down, and is the
one breaking up a family we have. I am really sorry. On one hand I
felt it's been long past due, that it should have ended a long time
ago so the agonies we have experienced in the past few years would not
have been necessary; on the other hand it never feels a <em>right</em> moment
to do this. It is like watching your own child or pet sick in bed but
all you could do is watching it slowly fade, weaken, and die.</p>
<p>I don't know. I have this resentment inside me against you, which made
my both unpleasant, rude, and unhealthy, not only to you, but to
anyone around me. I used to resent you not trying to save or to change
our situation. But I also question myself whether I have tried, and
what I have tried. I tried to go away, try to make my absence a
painful reminder to you of what we had, met two in my life who,
inevitably, left a mark on our breakdown, one smartly chose another
man better than what I could give her, and one spoiled me with her
love and beauty to put me back on my feet.</p>
<p>I am the lucky one. I always had wonderful women in my life, from the
first girl I met, to you, to siqi. I couldn't help now facing the
harsh reality that it must have been me who have disappointed you all,
by not being wise when I need to, not being sensitive when I need to,
not being respectful, or forceful, or independent, or mature, or any
of the adjectives that woman wishes in a man, when it should have been
there.</p>
<p>Sometimes I thought of those blant riches who claim not to marry until
he has enough money to give his woman comfort and style. I still can't
bring myself to approve this view. But I see its merit now &mdash; it
is better, more responsible I think, to provide your loved one such
things, than expecting her to be on your side thick or thin
unconditionally &mdash; it's an idealistic version of love life, but
not life itself.</p>
<p>I want to thank you for the years when I was jobless, wondering around
with a bloated ego but a pathetic understanding of you. I really
enjoyed the years in MBA, and the days when I felt at the brink of
fortune and fame. But more and more with each day passes, I hate the
version of me in those days because I was ego-centric,
self-importance, self-centered, short-tempered, aggressive, and greed
of success to prove myself. Looking back, it is also a double-edged
sword, that having you and this family made me proud, gave me
confidence, resulting in an enlarged ego, which in turn led me astray
&mdash; in the process of building a better life for the ones I cared,
I lost the ones along the way.</p>
<p>How pity was I! If you have seen through all these back then, I would
have to say that you are indeed wiser than I realized, and which makes
me even more in debt that you have still agreed to be with
me. Ten-year is not the longest of a personal relationship I have
experienced, but is most intimate one of that length, and certainly a
fruitful one because of Noah. I sometime think of him whether he is a
bond or a bond-breaker. What would be us without him? would less
stress from raising a child have made things easier? better? or worse?</p>
<p>I don't know. On his good days I had no doubt he is the best decision
having made; then on the others I wonder what I have done. He is
fine. He will grow, regardless how we raise him or what we give him,
or not give him. My resentment used to be caused by imagining an ideal
life for him that he now is going to miss. But truth is, he will be
fine. He will adopt a life of his own, and however we think we have
shaped that, it will not be. There will be residual memories of how we
have conducted things that he will recall, will take in, and will
apply. But the majority of him will be picked up randomly from him
school, his friends, his hours and days when none of us is
around. There is the influence of genes; then there is the influence
of the world.</p>
<p>Whiling reading those disturbing books, sometimes I even wonder
whether bringing him to this world is a good or a bad thing. Life is
hard. I have yet to come across anyone whose life isn't &mdash; there
is always a seemingly glory on surface, with torrents of trouble
underneath. Five years ago it scared me to think of separation,
logistic headaches, and the gloomy prospect of future life. Now, I
think it's just there, whether separation or not, different set of
problems, but equally challenging, agonizing, and scary. </p>
<p>I think it's better this way, at least no suspense. One day I was
driving and was thinking over financial statement analysis, a book I
am reading, a line suddenly occurred to me, if I were a comedian
standing on a stage, is that "If you are a disorganized person or
company, how should you manage you finance!?  Just take on a shit load
of debt, so now the banks and lenders will put together the best
statement and analysis of you yourself don't even know how to, and will
also watch your progress in such a keen spirit that no change will
escape. So now just for free, you have an army of experienced
accountant, analyst, finance expert, to work for you, for free! ha,
ha, ha" Because, by doing so, there is no analysis needed anymore, no
suspense, no prediction of how well you will be doing if I lend you
money &mdash; you are in debt, done. I think this principle applies in
life.</p>
<p>Instead of keeping a suspense, I am dropping the other shoe, so it is
now done, and we can all react to it with fact, not guessing.</p>
<p>With Noah between us, there will always be a tie uncut. So I don't
think this will be the LAST letter to you. But if I do end up dead
tomorrow or the next moment, at least I wrote down everything I want
to say at this moment, and made it available to you. Since I have
failed to keep a promise I held dear, I should be extra truthful and
honest, so that I would, by the time of my death bed, claim myself
an honest person. I used to think high of myself with many good
traits. Now, I only wish I could win this last defense. </p>
<p>I meant to say sorry when I handed you the notification, but I
didn't. I was afraid of tears, emotion, and waver of this decision. I
retreat to this mean I know of, by writing and email. I think it's
better to write, as it gives me a chance to reflect, to organize my
thoughts, to re-read and re-check, so I know I am speaking with
understanding of what I am saying, and what it may bring.</p>
<p>I am really really sorry. I let you down. But now you are free, and I
can not hold on anymore. What I owed, I don't know how to
repay, and can not repay with any satisfactory conclusion; 
what I may help, I will be there. I may drift now in life and in
space, so I don't know where I will be eventually. But I will make 
myself available if you ask. </p>
