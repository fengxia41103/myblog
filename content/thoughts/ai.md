I have pretty low tolerance of BS. The hot topic of AI bothers me
a great deal, because it is being discussed by too many ppl who have no
context. It is becoming just another buzz word rolling off your tongue
to make you sound sophisticated and smart. But no, AI is neither
magic nor intimidating. I think it is a great example for human being
to looking at things with a straight face, cut to the core, no more
BS, no more hand waving and using some abstract, ideological fuzziness
to fool ppl.

At least 20 years ago I have read a line about artificial
intelligence, which cleared formed my view on this &mdash; There are
two ways to define __intelligence__:

1. Machine emulate human's train of thoughts, and derives
   the same conclusion.
2. Machine ignores your human brain, finds its own way, and
   arrive the same conclusion.

The key is, <span class="myhighlight">the final result is the
same</span>. So how can you distinguish the difference? does process
even matter? If we both doing math, `4 x 8`, human uses
**multiplication**, you know what? computers know nothing about
multiplications, to it, everything is an `add`, period. It will add
these numbers that many times, but much much much faster than any human can
do. For human, single digit has shortcuts, double digit
multiplications takes a paper and pen, and when you are
talking about a 12737-digit number multiplying another 28787-digit
number, forget it. Computer is going to win, hands down, 
every, single, time. You know why?
because to computer, `4x8` is the same as `29837497972 x 980987574009`,
same method, same logic, repetitive of the same action.

That's the beauty of it, isn't it? If you just look at this example
closely, you will start to realize this isn't even a need for debate
&mdash; the core of multiplication, or the true concept of
multiplication, is addition. So putting the same lens over Alpha Go
and its recently victories over all top players, I think it is exactly
because the computer implementation of Go cuts down the BS around this
game, which was used to be thought being an art of Zen, so
philosophical, so hard to master, hard to comprehend, and the players
are all god like beings. Well, here it is, computer engineers, as
being a group of dumb and unsophisticated and simple-minded beings,
looked at this game and said to themselves:

> "What is this empror wearing?"


And this same line of story has been playing all over the human
history. In speed, in energy, in any physical strength arena, we human
have already accepted defeat. The only cover left for our pride is the
so called **intelligence**, and losing this is making us feel
uncomfortable. This is unnecessary at all. Just because no one has
ever been able to decipher and define <span
class="myhighlight">clearly</span> what human intelligence is, it
doesn't mean we are superior to machine. I actually think this
progress in defeating the Go game is a wonderful lesson for human, for
anyone who likes and enjoys to wrap themselves around with mystery so
to feel good. <span class="myhighlight">If the empror is naked, so he
is</span>.  If it looks great but no one can explain, it is nothing
but a willingness to make yourself believe in.


Alpha Go, just like addition vs. multiplication, gets us one step
closer to what the core of Go is, after thousands of years of zen-ing
of self-addiction. This is not only a feat of computer engineering and
so called deep learning or AI or whatever fancy words you know, this
is a **giant leap** for Go itself &mdash; machine is a challenger, a
pile of cold-blooded emotionless solid-state electronics, a kid who
shouted out "Look he is, naked!" Multiplication is a must in math
concept, it has its use in many many ways. When machine derives the
same answer by brute-force addition, it is not cheating, it is not
**intelligent** either. It is merely anchoring the truth of that
concept so human don't forget.


Human intelligence, AI, same deal, no one is superior to the
other. There is difference in efficiency, and there is difference in
how objective one versus another. If someone loses his game, not
because the machine is smarter, but because the group of ppl behind
those machines are not satisfied with the given answer, and wanted to
think deeper of inherited __truth__.  Computer, just like any other
mechanics and electronics human invented, are just tools to make the
work more efficient. Tools don't crack the code, we do; computer
doesn't make decisions, the writer of that `if-else` line do.

```python
# FACT: is he naked
if have_clothes_on:
    naked = False;
else:
    naked = True;

# OPINION: does he look good
if i_like_it:
    looking_good = True;
else:
    looking_good = False;
```

Here, computer identifies two variables representing two completly
different dimensions. This is just my simplified view of the world
when looking at the empror. If you mixed the two in your head, wow,
it's a Dao, a Zen, a culture, a you-can-only-feel-it abstract, and
that is when you start saying "how wonderful his new gown looks!"
