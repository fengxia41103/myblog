Pushing open the window on this Sunday morning. Here it is, again,
the sound of violin, was silent before, now, like the fresh air washed
by the rain &mdash; cool, clear, crispy, 飘进来, so fit for the time,
for the day, for the weather, for the moment.

I haven't yet figured out where that is from. It was only on
Saturdays, and, I think it comes as a live &larr; someone who is
playing it, maybe a morning practice, whoever this is, s/he is very
very good, because it sounded just like [Hilary Hahn playing Bach][1].

Fall is here. Leaves in North Carolina have not yet all turned
colors. New England must have lost all its Fall already by this
time. Actually it was on the news that Boston got 4" of snow! That is,
even too early, for Boston. Here, it's Fall, Fall, Fall, leaves are on
the street, on the trails, colorful, wonderful, sometimes messy after
a rain, but still, stepping on them feels like walking on a thin
carpet, and even with some wet splattering on your ankles and legs,
it felt fine. The creek by the trail grew quite a bit from the
rain. No wonder no fish was found there, I think the water is too
rapid for them to stay in one place and raise a, family. 

Ah, here it is again, the violin resumes its sound. This time, it
feels rather, far away, not like last time I heard it, I thought it
was right below my window, maybe the neighbour downstairs is the
player, but right now, it feels it just came with the air, with the
rain, with the sound on the street when cars, not many of them,
driving by, on this early Sunday morning, not really early anymore,
the clock says 9:57, but we just closed daylight saving last night, so
it's really the 11 o'clock before. But it's ok, late or not, it's a
good moment. Like the cool air coming to my feet, makes me wonder
whether I should go pull a blanket, but then, it's better this way,
reminds me a slight discomfort when I traveled last winter, reminds me
the town I visited, reminds me .... the music is like a string, that
when I'm there, in China, it strings me back to here, where I have the
music, the books, the nice, comfy life.. then, when I'm here, it comes
to me, just like this, reminds me the trip, the road, the people, the
moments.. what is the word? eclipse? yeah, 白驹过隙, when it's
memorable, when it's nice, when you wished it would stay, for long,
for long...

So are the ones in your life, so is the life itself, so is the moment,
like now.... they are like pearls, each a piece, then, here is a
string, be it a music, a song, a picture, a poem, a book, a note, a
conversation, that connects them all together, even though you don't
often see it at all, but it's there. And the pearls are now like a
necklace, you may not wear it often, but when you put it on, once a
while, maybe, or when you feel so, it shines, quietly, not to dazzle
your eyes, but to make you, elegant, pure, calm.
