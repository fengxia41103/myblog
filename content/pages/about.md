PY Consulting was founded in 2015 by a group of software engineers
who share a passion on technology and want to provide quality
service to our customers. We are specialized in
building web application prototypes using python django
framework and Bootstrap front end. Our key advantage is to achieve
a quick turn around from perceiving a concept to having
a usable test environment. A typical cycle runs between
4 to 10 weeks. In most cases, a site will be up and running
within a week.


From experience, we have come to realize that most _customers_ have
a fairly broad idea of what the solution may look like. Often enough
they step over to the solution side while introducing the problem to
solve by dictating a certain technology. This is perfectly
legitmate, but is also planting a seed for trouble down the road.

First of all, engineers are hired to create a solution for you. It is key
that they could __internalize__ the problem before forming a strategy
of attack.
Distracting them
with a half-baked solution upfront is counterproductive.
I say _half-baked_ because, after all,
we don't have a solution yet, do we? Otherwise, why bother.


Secondly, each technology has its pros and cons. Engineers have spent
time learning and practicing his skills on certain toolsets, which
may not include the fancy buzz word you have in mind.
No one will expect knowing the alphabet is equivalent
to writing a novel, let alone producing a nobel-prize winner. Therefore,
knowing python syntax does not create a _good python code_. Translating
an abstract business idea into computer language is like
composing a novel. You want a good one? then hiring a good writer,
and a good writer is hard to find, and pricy.


Do us a favor by checking out the samples we have produced in the past,
and documents that illustrated
our design methdology and preferences, then decide whether
our __toolset__ and __mindset__ fit your preference.

We are constantly building up our toolbox with new technolgies,
new tricks, best practices and such. But at the mean time,
we are stubborn old timers. We want to be convinced by a __real__
case in which our existing toolbox can not handle the challenge
_gracefully_ anymore &mdash; we think
this is the only way to evaluate how
switching to a new tool would help, by how much, what made the
difference, and in what situation it becomes useful.

We continuously scan the horizon for better solutions, code snippets,
methods, libs... and these efforts are put in to build a high standard
so introducing a new member into the tool chain becomes a seriously
decison, not driven by a buzz word picked up from a local newspaper.

We believe this is how we could deliver quality to  our customer &mdash;
if going to a war, do you want to be with somebody who shoots
a bull's eye with a WWII rifle?
or someone who can operate 21-st century weapons but
can not aim well?
