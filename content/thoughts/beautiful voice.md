Summary: 你是, 夜空中最亮的星

What a beautiful song, and beautiful voices! 

Yes, we have all been there &mdash; pure, pure thoughts, pure mind,
pure voices, pure emotion, pure love and hate, pure like and dislike,
honest, sincere, having integrity. When did we lose them? when? Like
pearls along the way, we let them lose and couldn't now find them
anymore, not only that we could not back track the same path we came,
but they, like those magic gems, once dropped, will disappear into the
ground, gone, forever.

Hope you will retain what they have &mdash; youth, beauty, smile, eyes
shinning like a star, and a heart of gold. 

Love.
