&lt;p&gt;Post go-live, and I'm almost, dead. It was so tiring over the N-1 and
cutover weekend, that I start to feel my age, and my passion of
working for the public sector is melting. I admire the dedication
everyone put in during this period, especially for folks who I never
thought would have picked up the ball and run so quickly. Without them
I would not imagine the system would haven even survived!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But, there were many things turned me off, also &amp;mdash; teams who had
an easy time because they had a much longer leadway into the cutover,
did almost, nothing. Nothing in the sense that they simply squandered
the time saved, continued to operate as if the system is already
perfect and they had achieved the goal, thus simply stopped working on
it. They credited themselves of the performance without realizing that
they did not, I do mean they did not, create what they had! The vendor
did 90% of the work, while they played along, inherited the working
copy, and mistakenly thinking they …&lt;/p&gt;</description><dc:creator xmlns:dc="http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/">Feng Xia</dc:creator><pubDate>Sat, 07 Jun 2025 08:43:00 -0400</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">tag:fengxia41103.github.io,2025-06-07:/myblog/post golive.html</guid><category>thoughts</category><category>thoughts</category></item><item><title>Worcester Woman</title><link>https://fengxia41103.github.io/myblog/worcester%20woman.html</link><description>&lt;figure class="col s12"&gt;

&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is, suffocating! What is going on? What is happening to this
country!? In this country!? By this country!? Woke up this Saturday
morning, another beautiful weather, another nice, sunny day, another
weekend of relaxing, driving Noah to swim, and myself taking care of
some chore and catching up some work day, another openeye coffee time,
mingling with a crowd, hearing the chatting noise in the background,
watching the young UNC girls coming in and out studying, another life
is beautiful, worth going through, at least for one more day.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But, watching the video clips of this Worcester woman against this crowd
of, gangsters, Gestapos, mafia, vallians, scrums of a human race,
wearing a uniform, but hiding their face, and power, and shame, and
humanity, and a thing, anything, that makes a human a human, behind a
black mask, then pushing a woman to her arrest, overpowering her,
what, 30 to 1!? 50 to 1!? one million to one!? This is not just
upsetting. Yes, it makes me very very upset. But upsetting is too …&lt;/p&gt;</description><dc:creator xmlns:dc="http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/">Feng Xia</dc:creator><pubDate>Sat, 10 May 2025 08:31:00 -0400</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">tag:fengxia41103.github.io,2025-05-10:/myblog/worcester woman.html</guid><category>thoughts</category><category>thoughts</category></item><item><title>Abstract</title><link>https://fengxia41103.github.io/myblog/2025.html</link><description>&lt;figure class="col s12"&gt;

&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Driving to see Noah's weekend swim meet past Saturday morning. I guess
it was the theme of the day, that many drivers rushed overtaking me,
and either found themselves waiting for at the traffic light ahead
&amp;mdash; it's either a poor timing that right after they passed me, the
light tuned red, or I was slowing down cause the light is red ahead,
but they still felt the urge to overtake, probably more of a statement
or a vent of frustration. In any case, I found it rather humorous
seeing them like a sitting duck when my car slowly approach while they
got nowhere to go.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This isn't new. But this time I got me thinking, that this,
phenomenon, can be categorized into one of the three buckets &amp;mdash;
眼睛不好, 脑子不好, or 运气不好. Hahaha. But then, while I was feeling
proud of such philosophical summary, I wondered how true they are? I
mean, are these three cover all the scenarios? Thinking of the &lt;a href="https://medium.com/lessons-from-mckinsey/the-pyramid-principle-f0885dd3c5c7"&gt;the
pyramid principle&lt;/a&gt;, how would …&lt;/p&gt;</description><dc:creator xmlns:dc="http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/">Feng Xia</dc:creator><pubDate>Mon, 20 Jan 2025 08:44:00 -0500</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">tag:fengxia41103.github.io,2025-01-20:/myblog/2025.html</guid><category>thoughts</category><category>thoughts</category></item><item><title>Christmas eve homeless woman</title><link>https://fengxia41103.github.io/myblog/christmas%20eve%20homeless%20woman.html</link><description>&lt;figure class="col s12"&gt;

&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Walking back from the local camera store, beautiful weather. Under the
sun it's feeling quite warm actually, like an early Spring. Here sit a
homeless woman. I couldn't tell from afar w/o my glasses. She was
sitting in the shadow on a bench outside a local auto shop. I didn't
notice till she moved. Then, she and I acrossed the intersection
together. I recognize her &amp;mdash; I actually I think I saw her quite a
few times on Franklin street, w/ other homeless people. I think
yesterday morning outside the Open Eye I ran into her also, in the
bitter morning cold, that she made a gesture as if asking for a smoke,
and I said sorry I don't smoke and don't have one. Today the same
gesture happened, and I answered the same way. Then while walking
along I could feel she was behind me. So I turned around, and repeated
that sorry I don't have anything to offer. Then, she gestured me to
take a picture of her! A bit surprised, but I …&lt;/p&gt;</description><dc:creator xmlns:dc="http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/">Feng Xia</dc:creator><pubDate>Tue, 24 Dec 2024 14:02:00 -0500</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">tag:fengxia41103.github.io,2024-12-24:/myblog/christmas eve homeless woman.html</guid><category>thoughts</category><category>thoughts</category></item><item><title>Chinese Proverb</title><link>https://fengxia41103.github.io/myblog/chinese%20proverb.html</link><description>&lt;figure class="col s12"&gt;

&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;All of sudden last night I started to realize what is wrong w/ the
Chinese logics, and why Chinese language env today is so polluted with
such even though they all appear to be so, correct &amp;mdash; because the
usage of proverb which has been inherited from so-acclaimed hundreds
or even thousands of years of historical development, is fundamentally
&lt;strong&gt;flawed&lt;/strong&gt; in the sense of communication, and &lt;strong&gt;in particular&lt;/strong&gt;,
debate.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Because it does not define a &lt;strong&gt;context&lt;/strong&gt;!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yes, it does not. Take any proverb you are familiar with, or that you
have used as a roll-off-your-tongue in your recent conversation so to
back up an opinion (yes, it is always used in a context of an opinion,
&lt;strong&gt;always&lt;/strong&gt;), because their trademark is short (usually a 4-word
phrase) and supposed concise, it has been honored as a wonderful term
of capturing a large amount of info into a small body of text, and
means to be shooting the arrow right on the bullseye, always.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;However, that's the exact the problem. With a short body of text, it
provides …&lt;/p&gt;</description><dc:creator xmlns:dc="http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/">Feng Xia</dc:creator><pubDate>Sun, 15 Dec 2024 09:37:00 -0500</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">tag:fengxia41103.github.io,2024-12-15:/myblog/chinese proverb.html</guid><category>thoughts</category><category>thoughts</category></item><item><title>No logic</title><link>https://fengxia41103.github.io/myblog/no%20logic.html</link><description>&lt;figure class="col s6"&gt;

&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Long time no see.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The escalating violence happening in the piece of land is prompting me
to write something. Also, a very tiring week, somehow, even though
work went well, made a presentation of Gen AI to the CIO crowd and all
the &lt;em&gt;captains&lt;/em&gt; on the ship, and I suppose it was received well, thus
it's really a good start of my day in this org. But towards the end of
Friday, I felt my entire system was slowing down, and I was even too
tired to play the phone. Maybe it's just a relaxing time after a
highly focused session, like a running train on sprint, that needs a
break to rest.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So this morning, all I want to do is to sit in OpenEye and dump brain,
on the events that is happening, that, from any way I could think of,
is a rare black-and-white one, thus should have had a pretty
straightforward expectation of people's reaction. Yet, reading replies
on Zhihu yesterday totally made me wonder, how my such maybe naive
view …&lt;/p&gt;</description><dc:creator xmlns:dc="http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/">Feng Xia</dc:creator><pubDate>Sat, 21 Sep 2024 09:32:00 -0400</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">tag:fengxia41103.github.io,2024-09-21:/myblog/no logic.html</guid><category>thoughts</category><category>thoughts</category></item><item><title>51</title><link>https://fengxia41103.github.io/myblog/51.html</link><description>&lt;figure class="col s12"&gt;
  &lt;img src="images/DSC_0567.JPG"/&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Came back from party. Met w/ good friends for some food and
card. Towards the end I just snapped. I don't know why I got so tipped
off by the saying. Maybe it's the "I don't care", which sounds to me
always like a BS, because this exact same words can be applied
mutually, if it has any validity. Isn't that we could all say the same
thing to each other, if we don't wish things to work out? Therefore, I
don't see any value in this line except as nothing but a moral high
ground in an argument in order to win.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I don't know. Noah's mom said the same thing before, while she was
frustrated and was trying to find a way of comfort. She said the only way
she found not get hurt by me was to tell herself not to care. I
couldn't understand this at all at that time. Now over these years I
start to apply this line in my own life, and is certainly useful to
deflect many …&lt;/p&gt;</description><dc:creator xmlns:dc="http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/">Feng Xia</dc:creator><pubDate>Sun, 19 May 2024 00:47:00 -0400</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">tag:fengxia41103.github.io,2024-05-19:/myblog/51.html</guid><category>thoughts</category><category>thoughts</category></item><item><title>Protest Isreal</title><link>https://fengxia41103.github.io/myblog/protest%20isreal.html</link><description>&lt;figure class="col s12"&gt;
&lt;img src="images/DSC_4554.JPG"/&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Beautiful weather. Went to the balcony after gym, and saw a gathering
of some sort at the church across street. Perfect to try some
photography! Was thinking to take Zf for a walk, but still felt
to take the Df instead.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A small section of the street was blocked by four policy cars, two on
each side. People were having their fun, food was served, DJ was
playing loud music. By the time I was walking across they were
inviting people to dance. Then by the time I walked around town and
came back passing this same spot, crowd had all gone home, stage was
cleared, and only some were putting stuff away, and a stack of folding
chairs standing there ready to be picked up.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I wouldn't have given it much thought if not because that earlier on
this walk I ran into a camp by chance, a camp of protesters on a lawn
on campus. Signs were put up says &lt;strong&gt;Gaza&lt;/strong&gt;. Tents flattened like a
piece of floor mat lying on the ground …&lt;/p&gt;</description><dc:creator xmlns:dc="http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/">Feng Xia</dc:creator><pubDate>Sat, 27 Apr 2024 21:26:00 -0400</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">tag:fengxia41103.github.io,2024-04-27:/myblog/protest isreal.html</guid><category>thoughts</category><category>thoughts</category></item><item><title>How many farewell</title><link>https://fengxia41103.github.io/myblog/how%20many%20farewell.html</link><description>&lt;figure class="col s12"&gt;
  &lt;img src="images/DSC_3375.JPG"/&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;How many farewell one say in a life? With growing age, I found
farewell harder and harder to bear. I remember the time when I saw mom
crying over a TV scene, and couldn't understand why she was so. I
always thought it's just because, women are all like that &amp;mdash;
sensitive, sentimental, cry over any little things that provokes their
feelings.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But. Now at the age, watching yet another TV scene of a Japanese
drama, the kid leaving home to Tokyo w/ big dreams and big future, it
suddenly hit me that, didn't the same happen to me when I was at the
airport waiting for my very first flight in life on my way to Ohio? I
felt excited, nervous, happy, and very little sadness. Yet, mom,
dad... now I start to understand how they had felt then. If fast
forwarding for two years, when Noah is to leave for college, I can see
that now, I can see myself standing there, watching him leave, flying
out of the nest, w/ his big dream …&lt;/p&gt;</description><dc:creator xmlns:dc="http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/">Feng Xia</dc:creator><pubDate>Mon, 18 Mar 2024 19:36:00 -0400</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">tag:fengxia41103.github.io,2024-03-18:/myblog/how many farewell.html</guid><category>thoughts</category><category>thoughts</category></item><item><title>Cold Winter Night</title><link>https://fengxia41103.github.io/myblog/cold%20winter%20night.html</link><description>&lt;figure class="col s12"&gt;

&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Sitting in the dark and listening to these music, watching the night
outside the window, flashing nights on the building far away, a few
cars running on the road at this hour, a cold cold winter night. I
miss dad &amp;amp; Lei, miss 猪娃娃, miss the days in Shenzhen, miss the time of
laughing, of talking, of coffeeing early in the morning, of playing
arcades, of window shopping, of watching the water fountain dancing w/
the music, of the crowd around, of the chess game at Nanshan, sitting
on bench watching the city below, of thinking of days passed, of the
people missed, of the life ahead, of the time behind. What a journey a
life is! I don't know how to tread this path well, or better, or
worse, each step seems permanent, uncertain at best, hardly there were
a few moments in life when I knew exactly what to do next &amp;mdash; like
going home to put dad to rest.

&lt;p&gt;Sitting on the porch going through the photos of today's xmas
parade. Cool weather, 60s, quite comfortable. Cloud gathering, but the
sunset are still shining through cracks here and there. Listening to
this &lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wXLjjIi_2GM"&gt;youtube&lt;/a&gt;, Nagoya,
the temple which I wondered into in 2016. All of sudden the memory
dragged me back into time, 2016, the year I still had a home in
Shanghai, with you near by. Today's your birthday. Happy birthday, 美
丽的人, as always, wish the best to you, for having a good time in
life, wherever you are, whatever you do, and whomever you are with.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;2023 has been, a year of closure. With settling Dad in April, I
finally felt I could let go a weight on my mind, not that I had wished
his passing, but that I had finally made the trip home, to take care
of him. I hope what I did, the trip to Nanjing, the simple session
that only our closest family attended, would have been the way he
wanted to, to leave this …&lt;/p&gt;</description><dc:creator xmlns:dc="http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/">Feng Xia</dc:creator><pubDate>Sat, 09 Dec 2023 16:46:00 -0500</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">tag:fengxia41103.github.io,2023-12-09:/myblog/2023 a year.html</guid><category>thoughts</category><category>thoughts</category></item><item><title>Nginx Redirect</title><link>https://fengxia41103.github.io/myblog/nginx%20redirect.html</link><description>&lt;p&gt;Nginx redirect is a super confusing topic. I have see way too many
blogs and articles and SO posts, each having a specific example of a
sort, but none talks about it &lt;strong&gt;systematically&lt;/strong&gt;. So this article is
an attempt to consolidate the information as part of my own study
notes, and provide a clear understanding of how to use these redirects
in nginx.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;Overview&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;First of all, there are 5 directives who will cause a redirect:  &lt;code&gt;index&lt;/code&gt;,
&lt;code&gt;try_files&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code&gt;error_page&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code&gt;return&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code&gt;rewrite&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Second, there are two types of redirect &amp;mdash; internal &amp;amp;
external. Internal redirect will cause nginx to &lt;strong&gt;re-evaluate&lt;/strong&gt;
location block, and browser is not involved. An external redirect is
to send a HTTP code w/ target URL back to the browser, and it's up to
the browser's behavior to decide what to happen next.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Below shows the five directives and their capabilities in term of
internal and external redirect:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;figure class="col s12"&gt;
  &lt;img src="images/nginx%20redirect.png"/&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;http redirect code&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For external redirect, the response will be sent to the browser, thus
it's up to the implementation of the browser to react based on …&lt;/p&gt;</description><dc:creator xmlns:dc="http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/">Feng Xia</dc:creator><pubDate>Tue, 21 Nov 2023 10:49:00 -0500</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">tag:fengxia41103.github.io,2023-11-21:/myblog/nginx redirect.html</guid><category>dev</category></item><item><title>Django Permission, DRF, OAuth2</title><link>https://fengxia41103.github.io/myblog/django%20permission%20oauth2.html</link><description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc6749#section-1.2"&gt;OAuth2&lt;/a&gt; is confusing! Here I'm gonna use Django as the framework
to how OAuth2 can be implemented. This shall provide a reference point
for others to see how OAuth2 is meant to work.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;who is who is who&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I'm gonna use layman's term instead of the &lt;a href="https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc6749#section-1.2"&gt;RFC&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;table&gt;
&lt;thead&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;th&gt;Who&lt;/th&gt;
&lt;th&gt;Description&lt;/th&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;/thead&gt;
&lt;tbody&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td&gt;You&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;The user who has a user account w/ Authorization Server.&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td&gt;Application&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;For example, my Stock app. You are delegating this app on your behalf to access resources, thus the "Grant".&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td&gt;Resource Server&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;For example, Gmail is a &lt;em&gt;resource server&lt;/em&gt; for my emails, GDrive is another for my drives, etc.&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td&gt;Authorization Server&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;Google as a whole is an Authorization Server. I authenticate w/ &lt;code&gt;google.com&lt;/code&gt;. Same for GitHub, FB, etc.&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;/tbody&gt;
&lt;/table&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;OAuth2 is &amp;amp; is-not&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Read &lt;a href="https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc6749#section-1.2"&gt;RFC&lt;/a&gt;. Some points not clear from the RFC, but are important:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;It's a protocol&lt;/strong&gt;. In other words it describes a way to
   &lt;em&gt;negotiate&lt;/em&gt; authorization, but doesn't care implementation details,
   eg. each framework/language has a dozen different implementations,
   all vary at details but follow the same &lt;em&gt;requirements&lt;/em&gt; defined in
   RFC.

This article is for deploying a
full stack application, in this case my beloved &lt;a href="https://fengxia41103.github.io/stock/#/"&gt;stock analyzer&lt;/a&gt; on
k8s. In particular I'll talk about how to migrate a &lt;em&gt;legacy&lt;/em&gt; system
like this onto a k8s based on my experience. This would give many
systems out there a clue of how to design a roadmap for such end
state.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;App's architecture&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Nothing special here: backend mainly as API, frontend React, celery worker
assuming a redis queue, redis, and DB.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;Migration steps&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The entire stack has been &lt;a href="https://github.com/fengxia41103/stock/blob/dev/docker-compose.yml"&gt;&lt;code&gt;docker-compose&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. So the question is
how to migrate these dockers onto k8s? In my case, three components
are going onto k8s: frontend, backend, celery.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Registry&lt;/strong&gt;. In development mode, docker images are usually built
   and stored on the local where the &lt;code&gt;docker-compose&lt;/code&gt; is
   launched. This is not the case in k8s anymore. Essential difference
   is that &lt;strong&gt;k8s does not build image&lt;/strong&gt;. It's to take the artifact
   from some registry and deploy. Therefore, for the two
   application-specific images &amp;mdash; Django app and frontend, the
   images must be &lt;strong&gt;built …&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;</description><dc:creator xmlns:dc="http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/">Feng Xia</dc:creator><pubDate>Tue, 29 Aug 2023 10:59:00 -0400</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">tag:fengxia41103.github.io,2023-08-29:/myblog/full stack django on k8s.html</guid><category>dev</category></item><item><title>Nikon DF split screen</title><link>https://fengxia41103.github.io/myblog/nikon%20df%20split%20screen.html</link><description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="" src="images/df/done.png"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I recently got a DF, and put a split screen in it.  I'm not a handy
man. I was very hesitant about this, but really wanted to give this a
shot for my manual lenses. So if you are also hesitating, and need
some positive feedback, read on.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Started with this detailed &lt;a href="https://richardhaw.com/2016/09/11/mod-nikon-df-split-prism/"&gt;blog&lt;/a&gt;. I ordered mine from
&lt;a href="https://www.focusingscreen.com/index.php?cPath=22_139&amp;amp;osCsid=2fa371v2s71klbv2o6lbrh6l02"&gt;focusingscreen&lt;/a&gt;. The website is old fashioned, but serves the
purpose. I guess it's such a niche that the owner has no incentive to
upgrade it. Using US credit card leads you to another web page, which
I guess is a 3rd party service. So the experience was jumping from
main site &amp;rarr; payment site &amp;rarr; main site. The convention wisdom
is, &lt;strong&gt;don't use browser's BACK button&lt;/strong&gt; in this process! Just let it
go through. If you stuck, you can always cancel the order w/ the
vendor (it's a slow order, so you get time), and through your credit
card company. I actually had doubt whether my payment went
through. For that, you could check the &lt;code&gt;My Account&lt;/code&gt; tab, which shows …&lt;/p&gt;</description><dc:creator xmlns:dc="http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/">Feng Xia</dc:creator><pubDate>Tue, 22 Aug 2023 16:47:00 -0400</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">tag:fengxia41103.github.io,2023-08-22:/myblog/nikon df split screen.html</guid><category>thoughts</category><category>thoughts</category></item><item><title>Oshin</title><link>https://fengxia41103.github.io/myblog/oshin.html</link><description>&lt;figure class="col s12"&gt;

&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;At age 50, I watched Oshin again, and found myself understand much of
this movie now. I remember the moments when my mom was in tears
watching this, and I couldn't understand at all why she would do
that. I was about Noah's age. Now, even without going through as much
as Oshin had, without suffering the pain of war, I could not help
knowing why it's so touching. What an epic, really, the misery of
life, of the era, of the terrible ordeal a human must go through, and
how fleeting a life really is. In the end, what is remaining? The
names would be all gone, forgotten, the stories buried, and who would
have ever remember there had been such a person, such an emotion, such
a struggle, be it a villain or a hero!?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I have been fortunate so far. Yet, I could feel the tie between theirs
and mine. Maybe it's the feeling of loss of someone you endear, love, or
something, or a moment which you could never live again …&lt;/p&gt;</description><dc:creator xmlns:dc="http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/">Feng Xia</dc:creator><pubDate>Sun, 13 Aug 2023 18:01:00 -0400</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">tag:fengxia41103.github.io,2023-08-13:/myblog/oshin.html</guid><category>thoughts</category><category>thoughts</category></item><item><title>Today's China is sickening</title><link>https://fengxia41103.github.io/myblog/china%20sickening.html</link><description>&lt;figure class="col s12"&gt;
  &lt;img src="images/DSC_1020129.JPG"/&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This news hit me. As a father w/ my son at the same age as these
girls, I felt very sad. I can not imagine how I would take such a
thing if it happened on Noah. The center of my universe would have
collapsed, and there is nothing left for me to hold on in this world,
this life. If I ever survived such a blow, I would nothing but a
walking zombie without emotion but hatred, of myself, of the harsh
things I have done to Noah when he was little, of his requests which I
failed to meet, of moments I didn't choose to be with him... regret
will be like a virus eating my heart from inside out until a death
would look like a much better option than breathing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Sad.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I feel this anger inside me, like cloud rising. I'll be a coward,
perhaps, just like the parents who were waiting in the hospital while
&lt;em&gt;under control&lt;/em&gt; of those authorities. But I can't. I'll feel such an
urge to attack …&lt;/p&gt;</description><dc:creator xmlns:dc="http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/">Feng Xia</dc:creator><pubDate>Thu, 27 Jul 2023 09:04:00 -0400</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">tag:fengxia41103.github.io,2023-07-27:/myblog/china sickening.html</guid><category>thoughts</category><category>thoughts</category></item><item><title>Chinese superstition</title><link>https://fengxia41103.github.io/myblog/chinese%20superstition.html</link><description>&lt;figure class="col s12"&gt;
  &lt;img src="images/DSC_0906.JPG"/&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Browsing Zhihu is depressing these days. Constantly I came across
titles which I could only call, thus the title, &lt;strong&gt;chinese
superstition&lt;/strong&gt;. Not only that many there are indeed superstitious in
the conventional sense, but that the brainwash education and
propaganda have further done damage that there are some only could be
called &lt;em&gt;urban legend&lt;/em&gt; are now being thrown around as fact, or at least
as some strong evidence to back up a statement, which then by the
nature of these evidence being so shaky or outwright false, is itself
a logical result of a faulty reasoning that is worthless. Yet, just
like a lie or a scam could still fool many, or maybe even to &lt;em&gt;fool
some of the people all of the time&lt;/em&gt;, they are received w/ ardor
defenders, and supported by countless referrals.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Since this is quite a phenomenon, I'd like to keep a note here, just
for the fun of it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Conclusion in shape of a question&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is a common practice, that a statement/opinion is posted in shape
of a …&lt;/p&gt;</description><dc:creator xmlns:dc="http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/">Feng Xia</dc:creator><pubDate>Tue, 18 Jul 2023 19:08:00 -0400</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">tag:fengxia41103.github.io,2023-07-18:/myblog/chinese superstition.html</guid><category>thoughts</category><category>thoughts</category></item><item><title>One is not the many</title><link>https://fengxia41103.github.io/myblog/one%20is%20not%20the%20many.html</link><description>&lt;figure class="col s12"&gt;
  &lt;img src="images/DSC_5197.JPG"/&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I would not have thought the word 苏州 had popped up in the headline
news because of such a
&lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jjDcXXNjWU0"&gt;tragedy&lt;/a&gt;. But the
aftermath of many netizen comments is really what I want to talk
about here.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It's quite common that the act of this woman being painted as a
savior of a national pride, which, regardless my disagreement of the
comment itself, is also implying that the pride is in a decline in
recent times. Thus, a heroic event such as this became a counter argument
of such decline, saying that not all are lost, not all are bad people,
and there are still good eggs left, which usually also implying that
majority of &lt;em&gt;us&lt;/em&gt; are the good eggs.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;However, this is a flawed logic. Period. The act of this person proved
one thing, and one thing alone, that she was a hero. She, herself, no
one else but herself, was a good egg. She had no intention to
represent anyone else, nor she had any obligation, or right, to
represent anyone other than …&lt;/p&gt;</description><dc:creator xmlns:dc="http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/">Feng Xia</dc:creator><pubDate>Thu, 29 Jun 2023 21:03:00 -0400</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">tag:fengxia41103.github.io,2023-06-29:/myblog/one is not the many.html</guid><category>thoughts</category><category>thoughts</category></item><item><title>k8s lab</title><link>https://fengxia41103.github.io/myblog/k8s%20lab.html</link><description>&lt;p&gt;I'm surprised that no article is giving a clear setup of a home k8s lab
w/ a Linux host. So here it is.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;On Dev node&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On your dev node, which is a machine outside k8s cluster
node. Assuming you have the following installed already:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Python and python &lt;code&gt;venv&lt;/code&gt; module.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ansible. Install it in a &lt;code&gt;venv&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;KVM stuff. See my dev's &lt;code&gt;kvm&lt;/code&gt; project for details. You could also
   use any VM framework as long as you could create 3 VMs.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;code&gt;ssh-keygen&lt;/code&gt; to create SSH key. If you already have a previous one,
   you could either use the same key, or create a new one dedicated
   for automation by changing the default value below:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;code&gt;shell
  Enter file in which to save the key (/home/fengxia/.ssh/id_rsa):&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Create a &lt;code&gt;$HOME/.kube&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Install &lt;code&gt;kubectl&lt;/code&gt;. I may ansible this later as well. For now a
   manual process.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In Ansible working directory, dump a vanilla ansible config file:
   &lt;code&gt;ansible-config init --disabled &amp;gt; ansible.cfg&lt;/code&gt;. Change the line
   &lt;code&gt;private_key_file=/home/fengxia/.ssh/id_rsa_auto&lt;/code&gt; to point it to
   the SSH key we …&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;</description><dc:creator xmlns:dc="http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/">Feng Xia</dc:creator><pubDate>Mon, 26 Jun 2023 08:47:00 -0400</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">tag:fengxia41103.github.io,2023-06-26:/myblog/k8s lab.html</guid><category>dev</category></item><item><title>Causal history</title><link>https://fengxia41103.github.io/myblog/causal%20history.html</link><description>&lt;figure class="col s12"&gt;
  &lt;img src="images/DSC_4598.JPG"/&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It's a common title line of a history book or Youtube that goes
something like this, "大明亡于一只鸡", which builds a causal
relationship between &lt;em&gt;major&lt;/em&gt; event and a &lt;em&gt;trivial&lt;/em&gt; event. It's usually
quite interesting to listen to such a story, but I had a second
thought.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We all know the cliche that we are what we are because of all the
previous days, hours, minutes and seconds, no more and no less, all
combined, lump summed into this moment, so that I'm now sitting here
writing these lines and having these thoughts. Without eating the
previous 8 buns, the 9th one won't become fulfilling. A change of
anything in history would then result in a butterfly effect that it
changes the future, permanently, the unbearable lightness of being...&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So, with these in mind, there must be a chain reaction leading to the
&lt;em&gt;major&lt;/em&gt; even in focus, whereas every single step, regardless how
minute and trivial at the time it took place, resulted in the final
moment when the &lt;em&gt;major&lt;/em&gt; even …&lt;/p&gt;</description><dc:creator xmlns:dc="http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/">Feng Xia</dc:creator><pubDate>Mon, 19 Jun 2023 15:25:00 -0400</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">tag:fengxia41103.github.io,2023-06-19:/myblog/causal history.html</guid><category>thoughts</category><category>thoughts</category></item><item><title>Fedex API generating label</title><link>https://fengxia41103.github.io/myblog/fedex%20api%20generating%20label.html</link><description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://developer.fedex.com/api/en-us/get-started.html"&gt;Fedex API&lt;/a&gt; is complex. A few things you want to watch out:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When googling Fedex API, the top returns are usually 3rd API who
   &lt;em&gt;supports&lt;/em&gt; Fedex. &lt;strong&gt;Not covered here&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Always&lt;/strong&gt;, use the &lt;strong&gt;test&lt;/strong&gt; credentials and API endpoints for
   development. Switch to production when you are ready for
   production.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Once you generate a &lt;em&gt;test&lt;/em&gt; label, it requires a &lt;strong&gt;verification&lt;/strong&gt;
   step by Fedex team. Email it to them and wait for approval. This is
   a human process I guess.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It appears to be a micro-service architecture because each service
   gets its own API endpoint. This makes integration a bit tedious
   because each endpoint requires a different learning curve. Not for
   a faint heart. For label, use &lt;a href="https://developer.fedex.com/api/en-us/catalog/ship/v1/docs.html"&gt;ship API&lt;/a&gt;. It's a long doc, but
   not difficult to understand once you get a feel of it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To generate a label, 5 steps:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Get an authentication token from API&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Compose sender info&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Compose recipients info&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Set shipment method values. Many are &lt;code&gt;enumeration&lt;/code&gt; values specified
   by the Fedex doc (they are in CAPITAL letters!).&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Call API. If successful, returning JSON body …&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;</description><dc:creator xmlns:dc="http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/">Feng Xia</dc:creator><pubDate>Wed, 31 May 2023 11:33:00 -0400</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">tag:fengxia41103.github.io,2023-05-31:/myblog/fedex api generating label.html</guid><category>dev</category></item><item><title>Python handling PDF</title><link>https://fengxia41103.github.io/myblog/python%20handling%20pdf.html</link><description>&lt;p&gt;It was a task I encountered in the China visa job whereas I need to
extract info from a PDF file that has been generated from the online
website. In its reverse, business also needs to generate PDF doc such
as an invoice so we could email them to customer. Since these tasks
are handled by backend and my backend is usually Django, it's
important to figure out a general solution to handle PDF parsing and
generation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;Generate a PDF&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There are two ways to generate PDF: generate a HTML and print to PDF
using browser, or generate a PDF in backend and (auto) download. The
first one is universal. It has no issue of many of the quirks such as
fonts. It's an WYSIWYG solution. The second one, on the other hand, is
relying on &lt;a href="https://xhtml2pdf.readthedocs.io/en/latest/"&gt;xhtml2pdf&lt;/a&gt;, which comes a few things you need to know.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Why we opt for one versus the other? In short, the printer solution is
easiest but it keeps no record of a user's action. This is fine for
docs …&lt;/p&gt;</description><dc:creator xmlns:dc="http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/">Feng Xia</dc:creator><pubDate>Wed, 31 May 2023 10:34:00 -0400</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">tag:fengxia41103.github.io,2023-05-31:/myblog/python handling pdf.html</guid><category>dev</category></item><item><title>Fullstack deployment: nginx, dotenv</title><link>https://fengxia41103.github.io/myblog/fullstack%20deployment%20nginx%20dotenv.html</link><description>&lt;figure class="col l6 m6 s12"&gt;
  &lt;img src="images/architecture_joke.jpg"
       class="center img-responsive"&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Deployment a fullstack requires multiple &lt;strong&gt;special treatments&lt;/strong&gt;. First
of all, the overall umbrella is the separation of configs by the
deployment targets, eg. dev/test/prod. Nature of these targets in
practice are quite different. Here I'm identifying some common tasks.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;nginx.conf&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I use &lt;code&gt;nginx&lt;/code&gt; for both the backend &amp;amp; frontend. It serves three purposes:
serve static/media files, frontend (eg. bundled React), and backend proxy.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;http vs. https&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In dev it's usually a http, but in production it's always
&lt;code&gt;https&lt;/code&gt;. When using https, use this config. The key is the &lt;code&gt;.pem&lt;/code&gt;
which, if using Azure VM as the host, would have these key files
already. If you are building your own host, you need to generate these
&lt;code&gt;.pem&lt;/code&gt; yourself.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="highlight"&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;code&gt;server {
  listen 8443 default_server ssl http2;
  listen [::]:8443 ssl http2;

  ssl_certificate /etc/nginx/waagent/TransportCert.pem;
  ssl_certificate_key /etc/nginx/waagent/TransportPrivate.pem;

  location ....
}
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Assuming the &lt;code&gt;.pem&lt;/code&gt; is from the docker host, you just need to mount
them to &lt;code&gt;/etc/nginx/...&lt;/code&gt; inside the nginx docker via &lt;code&gt;docker-compose&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;proxy backend&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Main use of nginx is to proxy …&lt;/p&gt;</description><dc:creator xmlns:dc="http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/">Feng Xia</dc:creator><pubDate>Tue, 16 May 2023 08:47:00 -0400</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">tag:fengxia41103.github.io,2023-05-16:/myblog/fullstack deployment nginx dotenv.html</guid><category>dev</category><category>dev</category></item><item><title>Dad trip</title><link>https://fengxia41103.github.io/myblog/dad%20trip.html</link><description>&lt;figure class="col s12"&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Finally, came back from this tiring trip. Having Dad in rest is a
great relief. I don't feel the same level of hurt anymore inside
myself. Though tears would still well when I think of him sometimes,
but not as painful as before. I am glad that the scarf that Noah and I
bought together are now blanketing him. Hope it will keep him warm,
safe, and in peace.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The trip was a tiring one. Friend said I was trying to pack too much
into too late time. But they couldn't imagine how stressful and home
sick I was towards the end of my stay in China. If I had many pleasure
trips and good times on this land, this one made me sick. Meeting and
catching up with friends were few highlights which made the trip warm,
friendly, and worthwhile. But traveling was indeed a tiring business

&lt;p&gt;Stuck at the ticket counter for 30 minutes while the battery is
draining, network is not working, application refuses to download nor
install, and ticket can't be processed until I show this stupid QR
code!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This, is the first taste I had on my real journey to China. Not only
they need the Covid test certificate, but a QR code, which had no
explanation of what this is, where to find it... counter clerks have a
printed piece of paper which had a few code you can scan, which then
brings up a browser with a download option. Then, my browser stuck for
good 5 minutes and gave up, saying the site is unaccessible. Tried
again, downloaded it again.. then it downloaded 10+ times.. then,
finally I open the downloads, find one that the downloading is
complete, an &lt;code&gt;.apk&lt;/code&gt; file, then click to install... well, Google

&lt;p&gt;Maybe because it's too early, it took me a while just a moment ago to
remember where we went yesterday! Yea, Yokohama, a place I read so
much about in books, but never thought I would visit it one day. I had
no idea where it is until I looked it up last night, and wow, it's
only 30 minutes train ride from where we are.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yokohama is pretty, really, and the building of Kanagawa University we
walked in was super pretty. If one ever wants to see an upscale
version of Boston, or any ocean harbor city, come here. And, if you
like to watch ladies in suits, well, I guess any train station in
Japan will be fine, but here you get the streamline version because of
the big glass buildings and finance district, smells money, smells
upscale, smells neat, clean, perfection, for their product, their men
and women. Incredible. Maybe I'm a bit obesessed, but they are simply
pleasant to look at. I can't help having a feeling that beauty in this …&lt;/p&gt;</description><dc:creator xmlns:dc="http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/">Feng Xia</dc:creator><pubDate>Mon, 03 Apr 2023 05:05:00 -0400</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">tag:fengxia41103.github.io,2023-04-03:/myblog/fun in a small life.html</guid><category>thoughts</category><category>thoughts</category></item><item><title>Cherry</title><link>https://fengxia41103.github.io/myblog/cherry.html</link><description>&lt;figure class="col s12"&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Second day in Tokyo. Cherry blossom.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It was a genuine surprise that we walked right into this shrine. I
have heard so much of it growing up with the ideology, but seeing it
is, different. Beautiful spring day. Watching the locals coming in
groups, old and young, I could only guess that this is a spring
weekend outing for many, like walking to a park where you would find
the best cherries, nothing special, nothing heavy, nothing sad.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The cherry trees are beautiful. Though I got just as much pedals in
Cary as here, the trees here felt more, aged, fitting for the scene,
fitting for the culture, fitting for the emotion. I don't know why,
but I felt tremendous sadness. Spring breeze came from time to time,
scattering the pedals as a rain. God knows how many phones and cameras
were capturing the moment. People smiled, selfied, what a good life,
but indeed cherry is like life, beautiful in some time, then, blown
away. For the people who died in the war, or any …&lt;/p&gt;</description><dc:creator xmlns:dc="http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/">Feng Xia</dc:creator><pubDate>Sun, 02 Apr 2023 03:51:00 -0400</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">tag:fengxia41103.github.io,2023-04-02:/myblog/cherry.html</guid><category>thoughts</category><category>thoughts</category></item><item><title>2023 home trip freddie</title><link>https://fengxia41103.github.io/myblog/2023%20home%20trip%20freddie.html</link><description>&lt;figure class="col s12"&gt;

  &lt;img src="images/DSC_0820.JPG"/&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In my development this is a common scenario that I have a stack up and
running on a server which has an IP but no domain. This creates a
problem for getting a cert using &lt;a href="https://certbot.eff.org/"&gt;certbot&lt;/a&gt;. Instead, on Azure VM
there is already a folder called &lt;code&gt;waagent&lt;/code&gt; which has a cert. So the
idea is to use the same cert for HTTPs.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;First, define the django application as an &lt;code&gt;upstream&lt;/code&gt;. Here the
&lt;code&gt;web:8001&lt;/code&gt; is that the django docker service is named &lt;code&gt;web&lt;/code&gt; (in
&lt;code&gt;docker-compose&lt;/code&gt;) and on port &lt;code&gt;8001&lt;/code&gt; of this web docker.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="highlight"&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;upstream&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;django&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="err"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="w"&gt;  &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="c1"&gt;# must be your docker host IP, `localhost` won&amp;#39;t work!&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="w"&gt;  &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="k"&gt;server&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;web&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="mi"&gt;8001&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="err"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Second, serve as the proxy for upstream &lt;code&gt;django&lt;/code&gt;. This snippet lives
inside a &lt;code&gt;server {.... }&lt;/code&gt;. Here we define the location as
&lt;code&gt;@proxy_to_app&lt;/code&gt;, important!! This will later be used in &lt;code&gt;redirect&lt;/code&gt; section.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="highlight"&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;location&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="err"&gt;@&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;proxy_to_app&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="w"&gt;  &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;proxy_pass&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;http&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="c1"&gt;//django;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="w"&gt;  &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;proxy_http_version&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="m m-Double"&gt;1.1&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="w"&gt;  &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;proxy_set_header&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;Upgrade&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="err"&gt;$&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;http_upgrade&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="w"&gt;  &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;proxy_set_header&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;Connection&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s"&gt;&amp;quot;upgrade&amp;quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class="w"&gt;  &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;proxy_redirect&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;off&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="w"&gt;  &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;proxy_set_header&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;Host&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="err"&gt;$&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;host&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="w"&gt;  &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;proxy_set_header&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;X&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;-&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;Real&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;-&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;IP&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="err"&gt;$&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;remote_addr&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The ChatGPT is all over the internet these days. Had a long discussion
yesterday, and it's becoming clearer and clearer to me that this is
nothing but another hype, and I could say this is going to be a short
one, too. NPR's view on this is right on the mark, I think, that
chatgpt is a mirror of our past &amp;mdash; in other words, it is
"perpetuating" what we have said about a thing. In my word, it is a
library or Google on steroid. It does make accessibility to these
&lt;em&gt;text&lt;/em&gt; easier, but it also highlight more and more that the bottleneck
of this entire &lt;strong&gt;knowledge chain&lt;/strong&gt;, which used to be bounded by the
exclusiveness of text books and/or domain knowledge, are now
completely determined by the limited capacity of human brain &amp;mdash;
just like so called drinking from a firehose, or giving someone your
source code.. does it contain all the IPs you want to protect, yes,
very much so, but it's also an illusion that anyone who possess this
code would be …&lt;/p&gt;</description><dc:creator xmlns:dc="http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/">Feng Xia</dc:creator><pubDate>Sat, 18 Mar 2023 13:16:00 -0400</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">tag:fengxia41103.github.io,2023-03-18:/myblog/chapgpt.html</guid><category>thoughts</category><category>thoughts</category></item><item><title>What is my value</title><link>https://fengxia41103.github.io/myblog/what%20is%20my%20value.html</link><description>&lt;figure class="col s12"&gt;

&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I feel anxious. Worked all day yesterday on the Chinese visa app,
actually made some really good progress &amp;mdash; I can now get data of
an unsubmitted form in JSON, and even parse data out of a generated
PDF! This is pretty wild! I never thought PDF could be parsed like
this &amp;larr; it's a combination of some &lt;em&gt;structured&lt;/em&gt; format of PDF and
some visual cue such as "selecting the ones below this element" which
literally draw a box from this element down, and any &lt;em&gt;element&lt;/em&gt; having
overlap of this &lt;em&gt;visual box&lt;/em&gt; becomes selected! Wild.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But, I feel down today. Running into a neighbour's friend last night
and this morning, the same lady who stopped me some time ago when
there were a homeless w/ some mental issue lingering at the front door
of our building, and apparently he stopped her that night, which
understandably made her extremely nervous when I met her. She talked
and talked, and I was only able to calm her down a bit by rubbing her
back and giving her a few …&lt;/p&gt;</description><dc:creator xmlns:dc="http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/">Feng Xia</dc:creator><pubDate>Sun, 26 Feb 2023 11:27:00 -0500</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">tag:fengxia41103.github.io,2023-02-26:/myblog/what is my value.html</guid><category>thoughts</category><category>thoughts</category></item><item><title>Job, and Da mama</title><link>https://fengxia41103.github.io/myblog/2023.html</link><description>&lt;figure class="col s12"&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Left the company last Friday. The end came rather quickly. It was
announced on Thursday's meeting, then got the call on Friday that the
last day was then. Couldn't really tell I felt. It was expected, and
the timing was rather strange because I was working with an agent on
my Chinese visa so that I could start arrange a trip back home to take
care of dad and mom. So rather feeling shocked or sad, it was a bit of
"now I could plan for the trip without obligation" then. It's ok. I
have seen plenty of such ups and downs, and going on this trip is the
most important thing on my list. Dad passed away last May, and I
haven't been able to get him to our family's resting place due to the
stupid pandemic policy China has been following until recent. What a
shame! So here we go. Now without the job to worry about, I could
really think about what kind of trip I would like to have, and maybe …&lt;/p&gt;</description><dc:creator xmlns:dc="http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/">Feng Xia</dc:creator><pubDate>Sun, 05 Feb 2023 17:04:00 -0500</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">tag:fengxia41103.github.io,2023-02-05:/myblog/2023.html</guid><category>thoughts</category><category>thoughts</category></item><item><title>Nihilism</title><link>https://fengxia41103.github.io/myblog/nihilism.html</link><description>&lt;figure class="col s12"&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Nothing is better than hiding in my little dark room and reading a
book w/ a cozy blanket, and that's what happened yesterday. But the
topic is rather a bizzare one, to my regular taste &amp;mdash; information
technology and its effect on politics, in particular, of the future of
democracy. Written in 2014 and added one more chapter at the end in
2018, the book reads like a prophecy w/ hindsight of Trump and
insurrection.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The point is this &amp;mdash; w/ the spread of the mobile and the
Internet, social elite is losing credibility because they lost the
monopoly of information. What used to be a top-down information flow
whereas all walks of experts, authorities were the final saying of
his/her particular field are being toppled because, inevitably,
their sayings are full of loopholes, which have always been there, but
the public has little access to any alternative reference/information
to discover, let alone to challenge. This echoes mine perception,
which I have joked w/ in many occasions, that Noah and his generation
have all the …&lt;/p&gt;</description><dc:creator xmlns:dc="http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/">Feng Xia</dc:creator><pubDate>Fri, 23 Dec 2022 10:48:00 -0500</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">tag:fengxia41103.github.io,2022-12-23:/myblog/nihilism.html</guid><category>thoughts</category><category>thoughts</category></item><item><title>white paper</title><link>https://fengxia41103.github.io/myblog/white%20paper.html</link><description>&lt;figure class="col s12"&gt;

&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The news clip of Shanghai's protest was a surprise when I first saw it
yesterday morning. But I couldn't help feeling the emotion charged in
the air, and the excitement after that has been now injected in my
body. For a full day and night I couldn't really dismiss the images
and thoughts, and earned to view news over and over wishing there were
more development becoming available. Sometimes I even felt an urge to
be onsite just take some pictures. I don't think I am keen on any
political agenda if there were any. But the manifest of human emotion
after such a long depression, whether labeled under the covid or not,
finally erupted and, &lt;strong&gt;heard&lt;/strong&gt;, is contagious and &lt;strong&gt;touching&lt;/strong&gt;. Maybe
it does speak to still a thing in my body, a thread of youth maybe,
that revolts for unfairness, asks for kindness, and leans to support
the weak, the vulnerable, the suffered &amp;mdash; a voiceless face, a facelss
name, a nameless victim.&lt;/p&gt;

website?" For example, I'm using Pelican to generate this blog
site. These are static files. So if I want to utilize my REACT skill
to write some &lt;em&gt;web application&lt;/em&gt;, how to incorporate that into this
website?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The idea is straightforward &amp;mdash; REACT is a Javascript. So, if I
can package my REACT application into a &lt;code&gt;.js&lt;/code&gt;, can't I just import it
using the &lt;code&gt;&amp;lt;script...&lt;/code&gt; HTML syntax? Yes I can! The key is
&lt;a href="https://rollupjs.org/guide/en/"&gt;rollup.js&lt;/a&gt;. So the idea is this: rollup will package your REACT
files into a single &lt;code&gt;bundle.js&lt;/code&gt;, and you import it in your HTML. The
connection between REACT code and HTML page will be a HTML &lt;strong&gt;id&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Noah's swimming training is going well. Though the kid struggles from
time to time, he has been in this and didn't skip much. After jumping
in the car reluctantly this morning, he started to talk soon after
seeing the figurine I put on the dashboard, and was in a good spirit
shortly. This, actually is pretty rare, and I felt glad that he is
indeed growing up and being more and more behaving like a, grown up? I
don't know whether I really like to him to grow up already. Sometimes
listening to his audio saved in wechat I missed the little boy I
knew. He is not a little boy anymore, which I'm both grateful and
wishing otherwise. I guess that is the dilemma of a parent, wanting
them to grow up quickly, being happy for each step forward they are
taking, but also want them to stay little because then they would
continue to be attach to you, and need you. Soon he will become
independent more and more, like driving himself to …&lt;/p&gt;</description><dc:creator xmlns:dc="http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/">Feng Xia</dc:creator><pubDate>Sat, 05 Nov 2022 09:14:00 -0400</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">tag:fengxia41103.github.io,2022-11-05:/myblog/saturday swimming.html</guid><category>thoughts</category><category>thoughts</category></item><item><title>Social invalids, birds</title><link>https://fengxia41103.github.io/myblog/social%20invalids.html</link><description>&lt;figure class="col s12"&gt;

&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Morning walk w/ Laifu, and found another small green bird lying on the
sidewalk, the same kind I found the night  before. I couldn't tell
whether it is the same one. At a moment I felt this could be the same
family that one was lost going out and never returned, then the other
flew out here to look for it, then bumped into this glass building and
suffered the same fate... I felt sad. Picking it up and brought it to
the same spot where I left the other one. The one I left was gone,
making wonder whether the cats got the bird, or they picked it up and
brought it back to the sidewalk where I saw it again? Don't know. It's
a warm feeling, however, seeing there are a lot of dry foods for the
cats, and a few containers of different kinds lying around, and a box
of water... some kind person is taking care of these cats. I don't
know where they are hiding. Wherever it may be, let …&lt;/p&gt;</description><dc:creator xmlns:dc="http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/">Feng Xia</dc:creator><pubDate>Mon, 26 Sep 2022 09:20:00 -0400</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">tag:fengxia41103.github.io,2022-09-26:/myblog/social invalids.html</guid><category>thoughts</category><category>thoughts</category></item><item><title>Swim meet</title><link>https://fengxia41103.github.io/myblog/swim%20meet.html</link><description>&lt;figure class="col s12"&gt;

&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It's a strange feeling that you got a text from a total stranger, and
it turned out we could chat like old friends as if there is indeed a
parallel universe and somehow we connected. She is a very pretty
person, and I sincerely wish she has a beautiful life, also. Maybe one
day we will meet in person, but it indeed feels like a destiny of some
sort.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Taking Noah to his swim meet today. I don't know what happened to the
sweet boy I know. I don't think I am doing a good job now as a dad,
and I don't think she is doing a good job as mom, either. He turned
into a person that is constantly unhappy, and is actively avoiding
me. I don't know what I did that is turning him away. There must be
something. But this feeling is annoying on my part. I hate to show up
at his door only to see him unhappy and unwilling to see me. I wish my
being there would be …&lt;/p&gt;</description><dc:creator xmlns:dc="http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/">Feng Xia</dc:creator><pubDate>Sun, 18 Sep 2022 10:08:00 -0400</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">tag:fengxia41103.github.io,2022-09-18:/myblog/swim meet.html</guid><category>thoughts</category><category>thoughts</category></item><item><title>Feeling down</title><link>https://fengxia41103.github.io/myblog/feeling%20down.html</link><description>&lt;figure class="col s12"&gt;

&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Haven't written anything for a while. I had moments that I felt I
wanted to say something. But those moments were all moment of sadness
suddenly hitting me &amp;mdash; they made me miss zhuzhu, miss dad, and
started to feel, lonelier and lonelier in this world when all these
lives dear to me are passing away. It felt like cutting strings that
are attaching me to this world, and I'm afraid that when more strings
were cut loose, I may snap one day, because there really isn't much I
couldn't put down anymore. Even Noah is growing up, becoming more and
more independent, and watching him now stepping to high school makes
me both happy and scared &amp;mdash; happy for him becoming himself and a
nice young man, sad for him being the strongest tie to hold me
together is having less and less effect on me, and I could now picture
myself going far far away without fearing too much of him being well,
being taken care of. Maybe taking a trip to Japan and living …&lt;/p&gt;</description><dc:creator xmlns:dc="http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/">Feng Xia</dc:creator><pubDate>Wed, 31 Aug 2022 21:27:00 -0400</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">tag:fengxia41103.github.io,2022-08-31:/myblog/feeling down.html</guid><category>thoughts</category><category>thoughts</category></item><item><title>Dad</title><link>https://fengxia41103.github.io/myblog/dad.html</link><description>&lt;p&gt;This is a month of loss. I should say, this is a year of loss. First,
zhuzhu, then dad.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It has been a week and a day. The last week of his life was rough. I
doubt by his will he would have chosen to live like that. But the sad
thing of a person's end is that the decisions affecting your body and
your pain were made by sometimes strangers. Regardless how your will
has been formulated, in the end, a power outside the ones who care the
most of you takes over, and it is not fun.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;How to think of it then? I felt sad when the night I had to sign off
his life. But I feel the dad I know has been long gone. When I was
holding his hand and watching him eating, I don't recognize him
anymore. It was someone else living in that body, the light in the
eyes were shut, and I wonder, what makes a person, who he is?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It seems to be a convention …&lt;/p&gt;</description><dc:creator xmlns:dc="http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/">Feng Xia</dc:creator><pubDate>Sun, 15 May 2022 13:09:00 -0400</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">tag:fengxia41103.github.io,2022-05-15:/myblog/dad.html</guid><category>thoughts</category><category>thoughts</category></item><item><title>AWS SSO</title><link>https://fengxia41103.github.io/myblog/aws%20sso.html</link><description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://aws.amazon.com/single-sign-on/"&gt;AWS SSO&lt;/a&gt; is a pretty interesting idea. It's actually a bit confusing
when I first touched it, namely,&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;What is a profile&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;How to setup a profile&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;How to use a profile&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The &lt;a href="https://ben11kehoe.medium.com/you-only-need-to-call-aws-sso-login-once-for-all-your-profiles-41a334e1b37e"&gt;article&lt;/a&gt; has good explanation on the concept. I'm gonna quote
it here so I don't need to reinvent the wheels.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;What is SSO login&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;With AWS SSO, you log in as a human, and the token you receive that
represent you as a logged-in human can become any of the various IAM
roles in the various accounts that they have been granted access
to. Even though you give a profile in the input to aws sso login, the
resulting session is not scoped to the account and role in that
profile, by design. In the browser, when you log in through your AWS
SSO start URL (in this case, https://foo.awsapps.com/start), you are
logged in for all your access, and can find the account and role and
clicking through it to get into the AWS web console. When you …&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;</description><dc:creator xmlns:dc="http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/">Feng Xia</dc:creator><pubDate>Tue, 10 May 2022 21:17:00 -0400</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">tag:fengxia41103.github.io,2022-05-10:/myblog/aws sso.html</guid><category>dev</category><category>dev</category></item><item><title>猪娃娃</title><link>https://fengxia41103.github.io/myblog/zhuwawa.html</link><description>&lt;p&gt;猪，&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I don't know whether we made the right decision to send him through
this surgery. But I don't think the alternative was any better. Maybe
putting him to sleep was a better option. But then, it would have been
equally sad, heartbreaking.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Neither of us thought it would have happened so quickly. Driving to
pick them up this morning I tried to sense whether this is going to be
a good day or a bad day. The weather is nice, and road pretty
good. It was nearly green lights all the way, too. I calmed myself
that today would be alright, and 猪 will be alright.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;猪，谢谢你陪我这一程，16年，是我最好的时光，也因为有你，带给了我很多的
快乐。我永远记得你在我怀里睡觉，那会儿你我都还年轻。时光不再，你我都老

to put on these three words. I'm gonna address them one by one but
going out of order of these three according to a rank of importance
they bring to the table based on my view.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;code&gt;Data&lt;/code&gt; first because it's the information source and core
   value. Without it discussion of architecture is pointless.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;code&gt;Architecture&lt;/code&gt; second because it describes the mechanics, the
   in-and-out of the data flow and the data processing, which means to
   do the discovery/magic to these data and create value for the
   customer.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;code&gt;Resilience&lt;/code&gt; last because this is a gray area that is highly
   dependent on the nature of data themselves and use case.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;data&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The No. 1 challenge of data enterprise faces is not the lack of data,
but also the lack of data. In today's world we have too much
data. However, in face of the richness of these data we still feel
&lt;em&gt;poor&lt;/em&gt; because we &lt;strong&gt;lack quality data&lt;/strong&gt;, and the quality can be viewed
along …&lt;/p&gt;</description><dc:creator xmlns:dc="http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/">Feng Xia</dc:creator><pubDate>Tue, 01 Mar 2022 17:00:00 -0500</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">tag:fengxia41103.github.io,2022-03-01:/myblog/resilient data architecture.html</guid><category>thoughts</category><category>thoughts</category></item><item><title>Noah locker room</title><link>https://fengxia41103.github.io/myblog/noah%20locker%20room.html</link><description>&lt;figure class="col s12"&gt;

&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Hi Noah,&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This locker room incident has been on my mind for the last two days. I
don't know what to say, yet I feel I have so much I want to say, ask,
and converse. I called Sharon looking for advice, and she suggested to
write you a letter. I thought it is a good idea. Words are easy to
make, but also easy to forget. By writing them down I would have to
organize my thoughts better, and examine again how the words would
convey. Hopefully this is a better format for us to exchange our
feelings, because I believe we both have a lot on the mind, but
equally poor at expressing them well. So let's try this.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I heard from mom that you are regretting what happened. I am glad to
know that, but deep inside I feel very sad. Both as a parent and as an
adult, I feel we have let you down. I wish we had known earlier of
what was going on between you and other kids …&lt;/p&gt;</description><dc:creator xmlns:dc="http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/">Feng Xia</dc:creator><pubDate>Fri, 11 Feb 2022 15:44:00 -0500</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">tag:fengxia41103.github.io,2022-02-11:/myblog/noah locker room.html</guid><category>thoughts</category><category>thoughts</category></item><item><title>Books</title><link>https://fengxia41103.github.io/myblog/books.html</link><description>&lt;figure class="col s12"&gt;

&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Going through the books I have on the shelf, pulling out some which I
feel could live without, putting on others which I feel they deserve
the elaborated attention being on the fancy shelf... all of sudden,
this idea daunted on me &amp;mdash; why type of books are more long
lasting than others?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Certainly there isn't a single answer. But there is always one one
could have. I like &lt;strong&gt;old books&lt;/strong&gt;. They are not necessarily classics in
any measure, but just having a senior age seems to spell well for me
than the youngs. The youngs usually have a much cleaner, and most of
the time colorful and eye-catching, jacket than the olds. But I found
myself tend to pull them off the shelf less hesitantly than the
olds.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For one, I would admit these old books have probably better collector
value, whether they were good book back when or not. It runs like an
antique &amp;mdash; the older it is, the more $$ in essence it redeems if
ever being traded. These old books, some published before …&lt;/p&gt;</description><dc:creator xmlns:dc="http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/">Feng Xia</dc:creator><pubDate>Tue, 28 Dec 2021 16:40:00 -0500</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">tag:fengxia41103.github.io,2021-12-28:/myblog/books.html</guid><category>thoughts</category><category>thoughts</category></item><item><title>2021 Christmas Day</title><link>https://fengxia41103.github.io/myblog/2021%20xmas.html</link><description>&lt;figure class="col s12"&gt;

&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Warm day, getting to low 60s, and felt rather like Spring if you sit
in the sun, a bit windy from time to time, I guess it's the cold air
and warm air swapping their places. It's nice feeling the warmth,
though it's rather out of season, and most branches are naked, just
the way they should be in Winter.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Reading &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/Wouldnt-Nothin-Journey-Enduring-Editions/dp/0807874108"&gt;this book&lt;/a&gt;, a slow documentary of this rural place in
North Carolina, a book of stories that everyone of them is in their
70s, 80s, or 90s, it's a story book of the past, of a place and time
that have gone by, likely never will return.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I start to feel that everyone's life is actually a mix bag of places,
identities, trades, and not the least, times. In a way, everyone is
misplaced, somehow, into a space and a life that didn't feel s/he
belongs, but then, it went on, went through, became someone's life, or
part of it, and then, a story in a book somewhere, or maybe never be
told …&lt;/p&gt;</description><dc:creator xmlns:dc="http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/">Feng Xia</dc:creator><pubDate>Sat, 25 Dec 2021 15:29:00 -0500</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">tag:fengxia41103.github.io,2021-12-25:/myblog/2021 xmas.html</guid><category>thoughts</category><category>thoughts</category></item><item><title>Cliche</title><link>https://fengxia41103.github.io/myblog/cliche.html</link><description>&lt;figure class="col s6"&gt;

&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Listening to this &lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CFq-cWuEAIU"&gt;video&lt;/a&gt;, an opinion on a not-so-recent event
between China and Japan, again, and this idea came to me &amp;mdash;
cliche. I like many of the talks by this host, but this particular one
sounds, dull, thus, cliche.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As a commentator on news, the value, or the content that we listen to,
is his opinion, which makes me wonder, just how many opinions one can
have? More precisely, how many different ways of thinking, views, that
one person can have on these events? Especially if you are commenting
on a daily basis, I feel it is a stretch on some days, not because he
is not good, but that a person's mind isn't always sharp everyday
&amp;mdash; on a good day, the thought cuts through the news like a knife
over butter; then on other days it felt aimless, and worse, becomes a
cliche.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Any more than just the variation of days, I start to feel more and
more that a person, myself in particular, lives towards a narrow end
of a tube if one …&lt;/p&gt;</description><dc:creator xmlns:dc="http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/">Feng Xia</dc:creator><pubDate>Sat, 04 Dec 2021 09:42:00 -0500</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">tag:fengxia41103.github.io,2021-12-04:/myblog/cliche.html</guid><category>thoughts</category><category>thoughts</category></item><item><title>2021 Thanksgiving</title><link>https://fengxia41103.github.io/myblog/2021%20thanksgiving.html</link><description>&lt;figure class="col s12"&gt;

&lt;p&gt;What a surprise! Went to have dinner w/ Noah together yesterday. A
cold winter day. And he went to Publix by himself, and got me a bag of
chocolate!!!!! Oh mine mine mine!!!! This is the very first gift I
ever received from him, all by himself, without me ever saying a word
about it, reminding him of anything, or even thinking about it!!!
Indeed he is growing up now. Soon I guess he will leave the nest and
fly away to find his own path. I'm gonna miss him. I know that
already. Yet, it's a happy moment if that comes, I think, that seeing
him growing into a big guy, and a kind heart, is the best prize I
could ever hope for in this life. Sometimes I wonder, that what is the
meaning of my life? After 2006 I knew I have a big role to play in
this family. Yet I tried, but I don't think I did a good job. I wish I
could be wiser, more patient, more tolerant …&lt;/p&gt;</description><dc:creator xmlns:dc="http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/">Feng Xia</dc:creator><pubDate>Thu, 25 Nov 2021 21:17:00 -0500</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">tag:fengxia41103.github.io,2021-11-25:/myblog/2021 thanksgiving.html</guid><category>thoughts</category><category>thoughts</category></item><item><title>Speak up</title><link>https://fengxia41103.github.io/myblog/speak%20up.html</link><description>&lt;figure class="col s12"&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It has been a while since last update. Thoughts come and go. Sometimes
they appeared suddenly, like a light, but I was always in the middle
of something, I suppose, so they just eluded me. How sad... the funny
thing is, the older I become, the more fearful I become if ideas and
thoughts don't come to me. Especially, when chatting with friends, I
started to see myself repeating the same idea and way of speaking over
and over... such a, &lt;em&gt;stable version&lt;/em&gt;, is both a product of some
offline thinking regarding the topic, and a sign that my opinions are
becoming fixed. At this age I do think having a fixed opinion on many
things is both a good thing and a natural outcome &amp;mdash; after these
many years of living and working and life experience, I doubt I could
be shocked or surprised by much anymore. Everything is like a routine,
and everything and everyone look pretty much the same, mean the same,
to me. I hardly even find myself laugh much these days …&lt;/p&gt;</description><dc:creator xmlns:dc="http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/">Feng Xia</dc:creator><pubDate>Sat, 06 Nov 2021 20:17:00 -0400</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">tag:fengxia41103.github.io,2021-11-06:/myblog/speak up.html</guid><category>thoughts</category><category>thoughts</category></item><item><title>Laugh is who you are</title><link>https://fengxia41103.github.io/myblog/laugh.html</link><description>&lt;figure class="col s12"&gt;
  &lt;img src="https://lifenotlabs.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/opiumden.jpg"/&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I must have listened to &lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bS0ER79x9AI"&gt;this&lt;/a&gt; before, maybe years ago. I don't
remember much, but it wasn't unpleasant.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But not this time.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After talking about &lt;a href="https://fengxia41103.github.io/myblog/china nationalism.html"&gt;China's nationalism&lt;/a&gt; on the rise, it has
picked up pace and become an avalanche. The most recent episode is the
launch of &lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KCDu88kE5Wk"&gt;this movie&lt;/a&gt;, Chosin Reservoir. I haven't watched this,
but it is nothing but a propaganda. Let's just leave it at that.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This &lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bS0ER79x9AI"&gt;talk&lt;/a&gt;, however, really disturbed me. Not that its content is
truthful or not. It's the audience. In particular, it's when and at
what they laughed. I never realized how revealing watching someone's
laugh could be. But this is a lesson I should have learned early in
life, but now isn't too late, either.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When the talk spoke there were two options for the Russian ambition to
acquire a usable harbor &amp;mdash; one in China, and another in Korea, he
paraphrased a line by the China's ambassador to Russian back then as a
proof that China also saw the issue clearly &amp;mdash; "Well, since there
are two options here …&lt;/p&gt;</description><dc:creator xmlns:dc="http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/">Feng Xia</dc:creator><pubDate>Mon, 11 Oct 2021 22:07:00 -0400</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">tag:fengxia41103.github.io,2021-10-11:/myblog/laugh.html</guid><category>thoughts</category><category>thoughts</category></item><item><title>Witness of an Age</title><link>https://fengxia41103.github.io/myblog/witness.html</link><description>&lt;figure class="col s12"&gt;
  &lt;img src="images/patriotism.jpg"/&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This has been lingering in my mind recently. I don't know how to put
it. Reading the book &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/Making-Tomorrow-Raoul-Roussy-Sales/dp/B00005WC9T"&gt;The Making of Tomorrow&lt;/a&gt; kicked off the train
of thought that the root cause of this thinking is the idea of
&lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Collectivism"&gt;collectivism&lt;/a&gt;, which, in the author's view, &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nationalism"&gt;nationalism&lt;/a&gt; is
but the ultimate phase of a collectivism.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I have long been surprised, first to myself, then by others since I
learned the idea, that the so called state, or a nation, or one's home
country, the one that everyone seems to hold so dear that it is often
analogized to one's mom, a figure which is highly sacred, in theory at
least, that &lt;strong&gt;demands&lt;/strong&gt; one's love, one's devotion, dedication,
gratitude, as if the attitude towards it/her defines who you are, is
actually quite a recent thing! In other words, I have never given too
much thought where this sacred figure came from. Taking it for
granted, I, probably like many many others, regardless their
education, nationality, background, family, and so on, are &lt;em&gt;born&lt;/em&gt; to
consider myself being …&lt;/p&gt;</description><dc:creator xmlns:dc="http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/">Feng Xia</dc:creator><pubDate>Thu, 16 Sep 2021 16:20:00 -0400</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">tag:fengxia41103.github.io,2021-09-16:/myblog/witness.html</guid><category>thoughts</category><category>thoughts</category></item><item><title>REACT Key Authentication (2/2) - frontend</title><link>https://fengxia41103.github.io/myblog/react%20key%20authentication%20frontend.html</link><description>&lt;p&gt;Following last article on &lt;a href="https://fengxia41103.github.io/myblog/react key authentication backend.html"&gt;API backend&lt;/a&gt; using Tastypie, this
article will show REACT frontend side, in particular, the &lt;code&gt;login&lt;/code&gt; and
&lt;code&gt;logout&lt;/code&gt;. Again, I'm very surprised that not many &lt;code&gt;npm&lt;/code&gt; readily
available to encapsulate such a common task. Blogs show how the author
has done the authentication, aka. authentication, but I couldn't find
much on how to design the logout &amp;mdash; Should I redirect to page
upon logout? if yes, which page, any? How then should the routing be?
and how to protect all pages to require authentication?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;Design&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;figure class="col s12"&gt;
  &lt;img src="images/react%20login%20logout.png"/&gt;
  &lt;figcaption&gt;REACT login &amp; logout&lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Observe the followings:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;code&gt;login view&lt;/code&gt;: First of all, I'm not saying this page is only doing
   login. It can be any view as you wish. As long as the login call is
   happening while user is using this page, I'm calling it the &lt;code&gt;login&lt;/code&gt;
   page, thus there is always a &lt;code&gt;login view&lt;/code&gt;. The actual login call to
   &lt;code&gt;post&lt;/code&gt; can be component rendered by this view.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;code&gt;logout component&lt;/code&gt;: is most likely a button/icon on nav bar that
   lets user to logout. Nothing prevents you doing …&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;</description><dc:creator xmlns:dc="http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/">Feng Xia</dc:creator><pubDate>Sun, 22 Aug 2021 21:18:00 -0400</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">tag:fengxia41103.github.io,2021-08-22:/myblog/react key authentication frontend.html</guid><category>dev</category><category>dev</category></item><item><title>REACT Key Authentication (1/2) - API side</title><link>https://fengxia41103.github.io/myblog/react%20key%20authentication%20backend.html</link><description>&lt;p&gt;I'm very much surprised that not much information can be found on this
topic. As a matter of fact, there are very few examples on how to
handle two most common tasks that every single frontend must face:
&lt;strong&gt;login&lt;/strong&gt; and &lt;strong&gt;logout&lt;/strong&gt; &amp;mdash; I mean, there are too many code
examples out there which talks from one aspect of things, namely
either from the frontend or the backend, but the code hows too much
details on the how-to, but lacks illustration of how pieces are fit
together. In other words, it has all the implementations but little
design. So after days of trial, let me write down what I learned, and
hopefully will put this task to sleep once for all.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;API Backend&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In my case, backend is Django w/ &lt;a href="https://django-tastypie.readthedocs.io/en/v0.9.11/authentication_authorization.html"&gt;Tastypie&lt;/a&gt; REST API and frontend
in REACT. &lt;a href="https://django-tastypie.readthedocs.io/en/v0.9.11/authentication_authorization.html"&gt;Tastypie&lt;/a&gt; is just a matter of convenience. Here in
essence I'm assuming there is a RESTful backend serving data and
supports API key authentication. If you were not fullstack, you may
not need to bother how backend is coded. But …&lt;/p&gt;</description><dc:creator xmlns:dc="http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/">Feng Xia</dc:creator><pubDate>Sun, 22 Aug 2021 10:38:00 -0400</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">tag:fengxia41103.github.io,2021-08-22:/myblog/react key authentication backend.html</guid><category>dev</category><category>dev</category></item><item><title>Pig teammate</title><link>https://fengxia41103.github.io/myblog/pig%20teammate.html</link><description>&lt;figure class="col s12"&gt;

&lt;p&gt;My friend's recent experience with her pig teammates were both
disheartening and sad. So she has been working on renew the lease for
her kindergarten for over half year now. The lease runs out on
7/31. Without it, the whole business would have to fold. Then, among
the four partners, the woman who is also the 法人 of the business,
made up all kinds of shits not to sign this paper by herself. But hey,
it isn't an option even, because the landlord insisted 法人 being the
only acceptable party for this. So in the end, just &lt;strong&gt;one day before
the deadline&lt;/strong&gt;, the four partners got together for a talk (and even
for this the woman resisted to the last minute, of course, excuses are
cheap and also abundant). After hours of agony, the four signed a new
agreement, included all the lines this woman &lt;em&gt;wanted to have&lt;/em&gt;, and
planned to go in all together, all four of them, on the signing day
&amp;mdash; three of them being the cheerleader, while this woman …&lt;/p&gt;</description><dc:creator xmlns:dc="http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/">Feng Xia</dc:creator><pubDate>Thu, 05 Aug 2021 21:39:00 -0400</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">tag:fengxia41103.github.io,2021-08-05:/myblog/pig teammate.html</guid><category>thoughts</category></item><item><title>New Oriental</title><link>https://fengxia41103.github.io/myblog/new%20oriental.html</link><description>&lt;figure class="col s12"&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The fiasco of Didi has not yet got me off the hook, now there is the
EDU, the New Oriental that was the crown jewel of english tutoring
service 20+ years back when I was still young and battling
TOEFL/GRE. Some wall street hedge fund guy said DIDI was a political
terrorism by the Chinese government against US investors.... now I
think the decision of k12 education is even worse than that &amp;mdash;
it's a terrorism on people's brain, in particular, on kids whose
future is yet to be unfolded, but now shut.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This reminds the Christianity before the reformation, that yes there
is God, but guess what, you can't get hold of a bible (because it's
sacred and rare and expansive, a book was expansive in general), and
you can't talk to Him directly except through priest, and his message
is only known to you layman through the mouth of our priests, by their
interpretation... what changed this was the printing technology. Now
book becomes cheaper, layman can now afford a copy, of course …&lt;/p&gt;</description><dc:creator xmlns:dc="http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/">Feng Xia</dc:creator><pubDate>Sat, 24 Jul 2021 10:47:00 -0400</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">tag:fengxia41103.github.io,2021-07-24:/myblog/new oriental.html</guid><category>thoughts</category><category>thoughts</category></item><item><title>Heat, Evening</title><link>https://fengxia41103.github.io/myblog/heat%20evening.html</link><description>&lt;figure class="col s12"&gt;

&lt;p&gt;What is this? Suddenly, I feel this, sadness, inside me. Just
played/practiced two hours in this heat evening. Maybe it's the heat?
But why such a sadness? Because Noah is not here? No. It's not
that. The call to Aunt Tam after Uncle Tam passed away?
Probably. Hearing her voice is both making me less worried about her,
and worried, at the same time.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Listening to this video, the two stand up comedians, talked about
their divorce. I don't have any particular feel of any of the two,
yet, when they were reading letters written to each other, it felt,
pain. Yes, pain, a tremendous pain... I can't picture myself sitting
there to read out loud a letter addressed to me from someone so dear
in life, it will be, too hard.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I don't know. Maybe it reminds me my life. Maybe it's the heat, or the
evening, playing guitar always brings me through time, through space,
as if I were sitting on the stool looking at that remote hill w/ the
pagoda, it's …&lt;/p&gt;</description><dc:creator xmlns:dc="http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/">Feng Xia</dc:creator><pubDate>Mon, 12 Jul 2021 19:50:00 -0400</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">tag:fengxia41103.github.io,2021-07-12:/myblog/heat evening.html</guid><category>thoughts</category><category>thoughts</category></item><item><title>Walking in Brooklyn</title><link>https://fengxia41103.github.io/myblog/walking%20in%20brooklyn.html</link><description>&lt;figure class="col s12"&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We walked a lot today, all the way to the uptown, ground zero, Empire
State, then back to the Manhattan Bridge and back.  Then in the
evening we took a walk around Brooklyn. Watching people go by, sitting
here and there, all colors, all kinds, some in gym clothes, some
jogging, some heading home perhaps, some hanging out w/ friends, some
just wondering around, some w/ family, some look like a student, some
homeless or the like, walking by a couple gyms and see people
working out inside... noise, humming and talking and loud cars and
motorcycles, everywhere, w/ the backdrop a beautiful evening air
decorated by a magnificent hue of red in the sky, it felt, both
alive, and struggling.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In a city of over 10 million people, walking on the street, living in
this corner of the giant map, makes you feel insignificant, absolutely
nobody. Motorbikes for food deliveries are becoming a city scene, as
if I were in Shanghai. All these people, are living somewhere, making
a living somehow, doing something, trying …&lt;/p&gt;</description><dc:creator xmlns:dc="http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/">Feng Xia</dc:creator><pubDate>Wed, 23 Jun 2021 21:42:00 -0400</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">tag:fengxia41103.github.io,2021-06-23:/myblog/walking in brooklyn.html</guid><category>thoughts</category><category>thoughts</category></item><item><title>Travel to NYC</title><link>https://fengxia41103.github.io/myblog/travel%20to%20nyc.html</link><description>&lt;figure class="col s12"&gt;

&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Today, Uncle Tam left us. Jookun came to join us for breakfast before
Noah and I leave for NYC, then his phone ringed. It was both a
shocker, and expected. It's hard. 谭伯母 called a bit later, talked
some, hard time. Good thing that both daughters are here, so he went
with all his families near by. It's never easy, but this is the best
one could wish for. Thought of scenes playing badminton w/ him in
MIT. Felt like forever ago. Hard to believe, yet, it's the way it is.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Traveling in train for the first time in US in my life. Felt quite
like the one in China. Four hours went by quickly w/ Noah playing
Sanguo. I think he go the hang of it towards the end. Towns passing
by, ocean side at CT, reminded me the drives along the coast when I
was young, single, and enjoying my car. It was good times.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But don't know why. This trip, and regardless where I went, I felt
like a visitor …&lt;/p&gt;</description><dc:creator xmlns:dc="http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/">Feng Xia</dc:creator><pubDate>Mon, 21 Jun 2021 22:32:00 -0400</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">tag:fengxia41103.github.io,2021-06-21:/myblog/travel to nyc.html</guid><category>thoughts</category><category>thoughts</category></item><item><title>Boston 2021</title><link>https://fengxia41103.github.io/myblog/boston%202021.html</link><description>&lt;figure class=""&gt;

&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Back in Boston, this time, it feels, foreign. Took Noah to all the
places I knew and enjoyed, but then, every place we went, I liked
them, and also disliked them &amp;mdash; they are still the same, I still
like them very much, but I can't find excitement, the happiness inside
myself, anymore. Sitting on the new boardwalk looking over the canal,
the beautiful scene of the old Boston harbor, it's the million dollar
view one could only dream to have, perfect sunny day, Noah next to me,
really, what else could I be complaining about? Yet, it felt, remote,
a traveler sitting in a strange city, knowing this is just a break in
life, and nothing in your life will be changed by this moment. The
glass high rise standing on the spot where CrunchTime used to be is
magnificantly pretty. Yet, imagining living there is cool, but it
solves nothing &amp;larr; so I guess it is this feeling of powerless that
is really bothering me this time.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Maybe it is the theme of this trip …&lt;/p&gt;</description><dc:creator xmlns:dc="http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/">Feng Xia</dc:creator><pubDate>Thu, 17 Jun 2021 08:01:00 -0400</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">tag:fengxia41103.github.io,2021-06-17:/myblog/boston 2021.html</guid><category>thoughts</category><category>thoughts</category></item><item><title>Mio on the Shore</title><link>https://fengxia41103.github.io/myblog/mio.html</link><description>&lt;figure class="col s12"&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It has been a long time, I think, to finish a movie like this, without
playing anything in my hand, just sitting there, watching, watching it
without much thought even, of what the story is about, and where it is
going. Like a leave floating on a lake, wave after wave, it goes,
here, there, goes, waving around, may end up here, or there, or,
nowhere.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I think I have been too used to having the mind occupied, by work, by
book, by idea, by an anxiety that time is slipping off my hand, that
I'm getting older and older each day, and it's such an undesirable
feeling, that I feel compelled to think of something, to make the time
count. But hell. Life is pretty pointless, it is a journey, a journey
that has no map, no agenda, no purpose, just a process, someone
somehow puts you on the map, and you have to move, here and there,
till the end of it, and no tell what the end is, or where it
is …&lt;/p&gt;</description><dc:creator xmlns:dc="http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/">Feng Xia</dc:creator><pubDate>Thu, 10 Jun 2021 14:20:00 -0400</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">tag:fengxia41103.github.io,2021-06-10:/myblog/mio.html</guid><category>thoughts</category><category>thoughts</category></item><item><title>Logic Fallacies</title><link>https://fengxia41103.github.io/myblog/logic%20fallacies.html</link><description>&lt;p&gt;Ever since I wrote &lt;a href="https://fengxia41103.github.io/myblog/burden of proof.html"&gt;burden of proof&lt;/a&gt;, I have been longing to take
notes of this topic &amp;mdash; logic fallacies. Over the last few years I
found myself more and more sensitive to these fallacies and, like new
parents who all of sudden seeing kids everywhere which they never
noticed before theirs was born, I see and hear these fallacies all
over the place. They are so prevalent that I seriously wonder whether
there is a way to make these knowledge/training more accessible to
large population so that people can start applying them in their
day-2-day life. I know the idea is likely hopeless &amp;larr; after all,
how many of us even remember or utilize the knowledge and training we
have had from school years? But still, I think it's worth an effort to
promote them, and even without leaving a mark and changing a person, I
believe having a louder voice would eventually make them heard, by a
few, and the number of those few would be growing.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Bumped into a movie introduction of this wonderful
&lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2rKZcAiLHlY"&gt;documentary/movie&lt;/a&gt;, "Faces Places". I don't know why. I'm drawn to
human faces. Since now over 17 years ago when I was working at Bit9
and started taking a lot of photos, I had compiled a folder called
&lt;code&gt;people&lt;/code&gt;, because when I was going through all the shots, I found
myself always had hard time to remove/delete portrait shots &amp;mdash;
somehow, I felt each moment of a person, being it as random and
non-purposeful as most of my shots were, it was still a moment of
life, a moment that s/he and I shared together, like two parallel
lines in space and time, suddenly across once, and only once and never
again.. it's a mysterious feeling. I don't know what it is, and I
certainly lack the art to describe it w/ my word and writing. Maybe
that's why I kept those photos, that an image is worth a thousand
words, maybe, that it has more power than I, to convey the idea, the
feeling. Everytime …&lt;/p&gt;</description><dc:creator xmlns:dc="http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/">Feng Xia</dc:creator><pubDate>Tue, 04 May 2021 08:17:00 -0400</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">tag:fengxia41103.github.io,2021-05-04:/myblog/faces.html</guid><category>thoughts</category><category>thoughts</category></item><item><title>Chauvinism</title><link>https://fengxia41103.github.io/myblog/chauvinism.html</link><description>&lt;figure class="col l8 m8 s12"&gt;

  &lt;figcaption&gt;The first impression of this picture is how many females
  reporters are there, and how young they all are. If
  media/communication/opinion are so influential, isn't this then an
  argument that females are actually controlling our ears!? Of course
  not! I'm rather questioning, why so many of them are girls? Do they
  write their columns based on the info they collected here? or just
  administrative task of taking pictures, compiling bits, and let male
  reporters back in the office to formulate an opinion? If so, how
  wrong this actually is already!&lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I have heard this word when young, but never understood what it is,
nor ever cared to find out. But recently I have been thinking a lot
about feminism, or be more specific, what is a woman? This is probably
triggered by watching the &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/Couples-Therapy-Season-1/dp/B07XB7XNLJ"&gt;Couple Therapy&lt;/a&gt;, which prompted me wrote
the &lt;a href="https://fengxia41103.github.io/myblog/why read books.html"&gt;why read books&lt;/a&gt;, not only I think relationship is hard, but I
start to realize how little I know about a woman.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I remember a Youtube video in which it started filming …&lt;/p&gt;</description><dc:creator xmlns:dc="http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/">Feng Xia</dc:creator><pubDate>Mon, 19 Apr 2021 10:05:00 -0400</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">tag:fengxia41103.github.io,2021-04-19:/myblog/chauvinism.html</guid><category>thoughts</category><category>thoughts</category></item><item><title>Independent Documentaries</title><link>https://fengxia41103.github.io/myblog/independent%20documentaries.html</link><description>&lt;figure class="col s12"&gt;

&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Out of nowhere, I ended up watching three Chinese independent
documentaries. I don't know why. Started the first one only because I
was a bit tired of reading books today and wanted for a change. Then,
&lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7TjhUdpJcOg"&gt;one&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y60DETlQLs8"&gt;two&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lVvx5TYVS6Q"&gt;three&lt;/a&gt;... I don't know what to think. The
strange feeling is that, I was initially touched, or disturbed, but
towards the end, I was a bit, calm? numb?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;No, don't get me wrong. I think all three are excellent movies. I like
the reality feeling of them, real people, real environment, real
life. I felt the stress, the struggle, the yearn to live and to
prosper, the familiar yet foreign settings of Beijing, of the
peripheral vicinity of the city that was as rural and dirty and
chaotic as I could understand, could picture myself setting foot on,
and have ever been. I don't know what to make out of them. I
understand all the words, but they all are stories of another planet,
another life, that has no similarity to mine, but I don't feel pushed …&lt;/p&gt;</description><dc:creator xmlns:dc="http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/">Feng Xia</dc:creator><pubDate>Sun, 18 Apr 2021 22:43:00 -0400</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">tag:fengxia41103.github.io,2021-04-18:/myblog/independent documentaries.html</guid><category>thoughts</category><category>thoughts</category></item><item><title>Why read books</title><link>https://fengxia41103.github.io/myblog/why%20read%20books.html</link><description>&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"If you only read the books that everyone else is reading, you can
only think what everyone else is thinking."  - (via
dryyoureyes-startbelieving) (via katetbk)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On my way out this morning to jog, I suddenly realized why I started
to read more and more books. The backdrop is that I have been watching
this prime video called &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/Couples-Therapy-Season-1/dp/B07XB7XNLJ"&gt;Couple Therapy&lt;/a&gt;. It's a reality show that
four couples showing up in a psychiatrist's office, talked about their
relationships, struggles, feelings, and all that. Boy, isn't being
together hard!? Yes it is! And this exact conclusion was going through
my mind, not only while I was watching the show, but when this morning
I was going downstairs to jog. Suddenly I started to realize why I'm
reading more and more books these years.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The common cliche, of course, are two. First, you start to be
interested in, say, history, and with aging, you have more life
experience, thus can understand better the complexity of historical
event &amp;rarr; more interesting now to read them, and to appreciate the
intricacy of the …&lt;/p&gt;</description><dc:creator xmlns:dc="http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/">Feng Xia</dc:creator><pubDate>Mon, 05 Apr 2021 10:32:00 -0400</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">tag:fengxia41103.github.io,2021-04-05:/myblog/why read books.html</guid><category>thoughts</category></item><item><title>Asian Hate</title><link>https://fengxia41103.github.io/myblog/asian%20hate.html</link><description>&lt;figure class="col l6 m6 s12"&gt;
  &lt;img src="images/bertrand%20russell.jpg"/&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This, is a genie in a bottle &amp;mdash; the entire hatred now felt by the
society and occupying the headline news and congress's attention. The
world paid dearly for putting it back, putting aside the actual
justice each side claimed to be. Yet, Trump disturbed the hornet's
nest, and viola, now it's out again. This is really sad, sad times. I
need to read Dickens' &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hard_Times_(novel)"&gt;Hard Times&lt;/a&gt;, maybe I'll learn a thing or two
in this parallel.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Noah's spring vacation.  It's super peaceful and quiet when he is not
around, that I don't need to get up early to cook and be on the clock,
like gears being twisted and turned and driven by some other larger
gears. Weather is nice, and my new guitar string worked out
wonderfully. That, makes me really happy.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I firmly believe that the human language, being as it is, is, if not
the root cause of all these hatred and evil, is definitely an
accomplice. I think the thought of discrimination is built-in, more
native than language, because, after all …&lt;/p&gt;</description><dc:creator xmlns:dc="http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/">Feng Xia</dc:creator><pubDate>Mon, 29 Mar 2021 09:12:00 -0400</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">tag:fengxia41103.github.io,2021-03-29:/myblog/asian hate.html</guid><category>thoughts</category></item><item><title>Stock Trend Analysis</title><link>https://fengxia41103.github.io/myblog/stock%20trend%20analysis.html</link><description>&lt;p&gt;Continue from &lt;a href="{filename}/workspace/stock/stock%20detail.md"&gt;last article&lt;/a&gt;.

&lt;p&gt;Unlike other websites where you usually have choice of 1d, 5d, 1m, 3m,

wish, and all following analysis will be done over this selected
range.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;Daily return %&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Daily return is defined as &lt;code&gt;(close-open)/close&lt;/code&gt; of that day. This
value is pre-computed as a strategy value.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I noticed that there is always some &lt;strong&gt;after market&lt;/strong&gt; news or earning&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;calls that will sway the market. Further, apparently trading is going
on after the market is closed to me! Therefore, there is a dark period
when the price is moving, but I can not participate until the next

experience that focuses on how a reader of this page is to consume the

&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;h1&gt;Backdrop&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The app is a complete rewrite of one which I wrote five years
ago. At the time Jookun approached me that he had some wise strategies
of investment. I was intrigued by his passion, but wanted to verify
its worth using some simulation. Thus a Django was created with Yahoo
finance daily data as the input, and some data crunch based on his
idea. Like all other ideas, I started to come up some of my own while
working on it, and gradually it let me deep down into the rabbit hole
&amp;mdash; for the first time in my career, I had computation so intense
that it would overheat my laptop and had it shut down! I felt I was on
track of something. However, it had then been left to rot
since. Though I had tried to revive it over the years, some of the
code was done in such a complex manner that I didn't have the heart to
read it again. One impression, however, always left me with a hope,
the difficulty …&lt;/p&gt;</description><dc:creator xmlns:dc="http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/">Feng Xia</dc:creator><pubDate>Sun, 28 Feb 2021 21:16:00 -0500</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">tag:fengxia41103.github.io,2021-02-28:/myblog/stock app design.html</guid><category>stock</category><category>dev</category></item><item><title>Impeachment</title><link>https://fengxia41103.github.io/myblog/impeachment.html</link><description>&lt;figure class="col s12"&gt;

&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I have to say, this is very disappointing. Listening to the calls of these senators to say guilty or not guilty, was very disheartening, when so many say not guilty. This was very puzzling to me. I mean, what would you do when there were somebody pointed a gun at your head? And isn't this capitol hill building like their home? So? We ordinary people were all taught that if someone invaded your private property, you can just fire and shoot. But here, their home was invaded by these mobs, and yet, they played so called politics! I don't understand, really, &lt;strong&gt;what is going on&lt;/strong&gt;!?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When I was young, I learned that those so called 世纪审判 by Soviet were all staged. I remember reading them in a book from my college library, and it was quite a shocker to me. I had little life experience then, and nothing of my own opinion on this subject. But over the years I have always believed that such trials won't happen in America. Not that …&lt;/p&gt;</description><dc:creator xmlns:dc="http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/">Feng Xia</dc:creator><pubDate>Sun, 14 Feb 2021 10:46:00 -0500</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">tag:fengxia41103.github.io,2021-02-14:/myblog/impeachment.html</guid><category>thoughts</category><category>thoughts</category></item><item><title>GameStop</title><link>https://fengxia41103.github.io/myblog/gamestop.html</link><description>&lt;figure class="col s12"&gt;
  &lt;img src="images/reddit.png"/&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This, is absolutely, entertaining! Wow, I have to believe that
somewhere out there there is a voice that is directing me to these
things, really. I don't watch the market usually, if at all, then,
open to read the news yesterday, and it was the frenzy of GameStop and
AMC all over the news! Of course there are plenty China readers
reaction as well. So, what to make of it!?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;China posts usually put this as a revolution so that common people
uprising against the big capitalist, the Wall Street. Well, it's
exciting thinking that way, but it's only what the surface looks
like. I don't buy this story, well, I should say, I totally buy what
the news said about the &lt;a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/"&gt;Reddit wallstreetbets&lt;/a&gt; where this whole
thing might have started from. But the implication, imho, is far more
than an uprising. So, this is another predict-to-the-future
episode. Let me try, maybe I do have a crystal ~~&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;First of all, learned in MBA class that stock market is pretty small
comparing to the bond market …&lt;/p&gt;</description><dc:creator xmlns:dc="http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/">Feng Xia</dc:creator><pubDate>Thu, 28 Jan 2021 14:19:00 -0500</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">tag:fengxia41103.github.io,2021-01-28:/myblog/gamestop.html</guid><category>thoughts</category><category>thoughts</category></item><item><title>Attention</title><link>https://fengxia41103.github.io/myblog/attention.html</link><description>&lt;figure class="col l6 m12 s12"&gt;

&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is a curious thing. By sort of a pure accident, I haven't been
looking at the 朋友圈 for a while. I don't even know how long it has
been, weeks? Not a whole month I'm sure. But here is a thought just
occurred to me &amp;mdash; during this period, there are many of my
&lt;em&gt;friends&lt;/em&gt; whom I now know nothing about. I mean, I don't what they
did, or said, or thought, nothing &amp;larr; because it used to be that I
got their &lt;strong&gt;news&lt;/strong&gt; from the &lt;em&gt;broadcast&lt;/em&gt;. Almost like a personal radio
station that you need to tune in in order to listen. Well, the flip
side is also true &amp;mdash; if you want to shut them off, just don't
tune in.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This makes me wonder why so and what it means!? It used to be that I
thought the people 做 when they don't reveal their thoughts but making
you to guess. As a matter of fact, this is a common conversation I
have w/ Noah these days, that unless he can voice his …&lt;/p&gt;</description><dc:creator xmlns:dc="http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/">Feng Xia</dc:creator><pubDate>Sun, 24 Jan 2021 10:25:00 -0500</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">tag:fengxia41103.github.io,2021-01-24:/myblog/attention.html</guid><category>thoughts</category></item><item><title>Winter evening</title><link>https://fengxia41103.github.io/myblog/winter%20evening.html</link><description>&lt;figure class="col l6 m6 s12"&gt;

    &lt;figcaption&gt;
    Noah's Kumon arts... what can I say? It's rather funny to watch
    his arts, though he was distracted. But it's ok. He is doing well.
    &lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Another evening w/ beautiful sunset. It's has been the best decision
to live here, being able to look out the window and see such a
wonder. Noah is like my lucky star. Only with his instinct could we
have been so lucky. He's at mom's place today. Was thinking to join
him, but then was in the middle of getting netbox work the way I want,
so it became another evening just by myself.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The other day, Google photo prompted me a photo of Noah sitting on
horse back, and it was dated 2018, two years ago. Wow, I remember the
event, when he and I were visiting my dad, and we were invited for a
lunch in this fancy place by this rich son of my dad's neighbor. Both
his daughters and himself ride horses, and actually own horses. So for
the first time in his life, Noah got …&lt;/p&gt;</description><dc:creator xmlns:dc="http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/">Feng Xia</dc:creator><pubDate>Sun, 17 Jan 2021 17:37:00 -0500</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">tag:fengxia41103.github.io,2021-01-17:/myblog/winter evening.html</guid><category>thoughts</category><category>thoughts</category></item><item><title>知乎, 名词</title><link>https://fengxia41103.github.io/myblog/capitol%20riot.html</link><description>&lt;figure class="col s12"&gt;

&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Watching the capitol riot was rather an exciting experience. But of
course, that's because I was hiding behind a screen, out of harm's
way, as if we are watching a war movie, sure, go for it guys, charge,
bring on the big guns and explosions and loud sound effect, whatever,
oh, where is my popcorn, honey!? But that's wrong, isn't it? or is it?
That's the dark side of a human, myself included, that lip service is
always wonderful and rewarding, and the bloodier it is, the more
arousing your senses become. What is this!? &lt;strong&gt;Gladiator mode!?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now, looking at comments on &lt;a href="https://www.zhihu.com/question/438235275"&gt;知乎&lt;/a&gt;, that is just totally
&lt;strong&gt;disgusting&lt;/strong&gt;! But I'm asking myself, why so? why I feel them
disgusting!? Is it just because I don't like Trump? or just to take a
stand of the event while myself really knows nothing about politics
nor these people inside the Capitol Hill? and why the word, &lt;em&gt;people&lt;/em&gt;?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;the people&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Can't believe how early this is &amp;mdash; it's not even 7:30 in the
evening yet, and still two days away from this year's Christmas. Noah
has been at her place since last weekend, right after his winter break
started, which is fine, cause I do want him to have relaxing time and
enjoy himself. I found it that I miss him a lot when he is not here,
and sincerely wish him having a good time when he is not on my
watch. Sometimes, seeing a young kid being kissed by his parent in a
movie, I start to regret how fast time has flied by, and he is now
already growing up, and soon will be a man who may not want me to hold
him, hug him, and kiss him, anymore. Wouldn't it be sad? Sometimes I
wonder that I feel this way because he is now the sole gravity of my
life and my existence, even though I don't admit it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;2020 Thanksgiving day. Sitting here and listening to &lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0Cg_0jepxow&amp;amp;t=833s"&gt;Hilary Hahn&lt;/a&gt;
playing Bach at the end of the concerto, what a wonderful sound! When
I was at Noah's age, Dad used to listen to Bach and Hendel, and I
thought they were no comparison to the pop songs I liked, and they
were not only not beautiful, but rather ugly, close to being a
noise... how time has changed! and how much I have changed! Maybe it's
the age, that is teaching me now to appreciate this music, and the
mind too fragile to handle the stimulation of youth, the bang bang
bang, but seeking now peace, calm, and indeed, beauty.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The big shopping day of the year. I had crave for a few things, but
then, while tuning up the volume w/ the remote and letting Bach to
fill in the room, I can't help thanking myself that I made this
purchase, and it works so nicely, and making this moment all the more
enjoyable than ever. That, however, also got me thinking, back in …&lt;/p&gt;</description><dc:creator xmlns:dc="http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/">Feng Xia</dc:creator><pubDate>Thu, 26 Nov 2020 10:03:00 -0500</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">tag:fengxia41103.github.io,2020-11-26:/myblog/bach and shoppings.html</guid><category>thoughts</category><category>thoughts</category></item><item><title>CP &amp; miro</title><link>https://fengxia41103.github.io/myblog/cp%20miro.html</link><description>&lt;figure class="col l6 m6 s12"&gt;

&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;What a shocker!!! 7:30 in the morning, all hands meeting, it was
announced that CP is canned, officially, and Miro is leaving the
company. Wow.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I was left a bit speechless, I have to say. It's probably so for all
the others on the phone. I found it rather comical when the big boss
kept asking whether you have any question, and now is the time to
ask &amp;mdash; this is a rather cunning strategy that asking people in a
pose of fairness while putting everyone in a shock mode first. What an
insincere moment!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So the product that I have been looking down for the last two years
are finally seeing its death. But this is still sad for me. It reminds
me what Todd said before &amp;mdash; if the team has a problem and you

&lt;p&gt;Pushing open the window on this Sunday morning. Here it is, again,
the sound of violin, was silent before, now, like the fresh air washed
by the rain &amp;mdash; cool, clear, crispy, 飘进来, so fit for the time,
for the day, for the weather, for the moment.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I haven't yet figured out where that is from. It was only on
Saturdays, and, I think it comes as a live &amp;larr; someone who is
playing it, maybe a morning practice, whoever this is, s/he is very
very good, because it sounded just like &lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q3-5144TaYg"&gt;Hilary Hahn playing Bach&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Fall is here. Leaves in North Carolina have not yet all turned
colors. New England must have lost all its Fall already by this
time. Actually it was on the news that Boston got 4" of snow! That is,
even too early, for Boston. Here, it's Fall, Fall, Fall, leaves are on
the street, on the trails, colorful, wonderful, sometimes messy after
a rain, but still, stepping on them feels like walking on a thin
carpet, and even …&lt;/p&gt;</description><dc:creator xmlns:dc="http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/">Feng Xia</dc:creator><pubDate>Sun, 01 Nov 2020 09:48:00 -0500</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">tag:fengxia41103.github.io,2020-11-01:/myblog/weekend violin.html</guid><category>thoughts</category><category>thoughts</category></item><item><title>Saturday morning in Chapel Hill</title><link>https://fengxia41103.github.io/myblog/saturday%20morning%20in%20chapel%20hill.html</link><description>&lt;figure class="col s12"&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It feels like vacation, this working remote from home, that's how it
feels, to me. Not only the work is not fully loaded relative to my
capacity, but the rhythm of life, especially when Noah is at mom's
place, just myself, sitting here, watching out the window to the
horizon, to the street, to the sunrise, the sunset... everything of
these moments, remind me the moment of trips I had taken, the one in
Japan, the one in Cambodia, the one is Huili, the one in
Kunming... just like this, sitting by the window, after a night's
sometimes sound sleep, sometimes an uneasy one, watching a place,
feeling familiar but at the same time strange.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There is this little barber shop across the street. The barber, Ken,
said he opens at 7 o'clock in the morning on Saturday. Here it is, the
lights are on. When all the surroundings are still gray from waking
up, the lights shine through his shop window rather feels brighter
than it actually is, but standing out for sure.

&lt;p&gt;It has been a while that a book can hit me like that. Maybe it's still
true that images are more powerful to me than words, like that
&lt;a href="https://fengxia41103.github.io/myblog/funeral.html"&gt;funeral pic&lt;/a&gt; I bumped into on a China trip. And here it is, two
sets of books I grabbed from the Nice Priced Books yesterday, really
out of nowhere ans I didn't even remember where and how I found them!
Yet, for the first time in my life, I felt, a human being, I mean, a
stranger, can bring warmth, to me.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;These portraits are not photographically perfect at all, not even in
focus sometimes, and in some I feel there were too much colors, and
the subjects tended to be a lot of old people, young kids, gays, a bit
like a focus on the population that are inherently weak and vulnerable
in the society, thus easier to evoke a strong feeling of sympathy,
admiration, and so on... But for this book itself, I will not call it
a cheap sell, because I feel the photos …&lt;/p&gt;</description><dc:creator xmlns:dc="http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/">Feng Xia</dc:creator><pubDate>Fri, 16 Oct 2020 13:44:00 -0400</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">tag:fengxia41103.github.io,2020-10-16:/myblog/humans in new york.html</guid><category>thoughts</category><category>thoughts</category></item><item><title>Medical miracles</title><link>https://fengxia41103.github.io/myblog/medical%20miracles.html</link><description>&lt;figure class="col s12"&gt;

&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is a topic I have always wanted to write about and research,
because, there are too many times that myself gets tripped up by
arguments or stories presented by someone, that sounds quite logical
and reasonable, but tickles me inside that &lt;em&gt;something isn't
right&lt;/em&gt;. But, what is it? I haven't been able to pin down. The reason I
call this article "logic fallacies" because fundamentally I believe
the &lt;em&gt;something&lt;/em&gt; is a wrong in its logic, its way of fabricating a
causal relationship whereas there isn't one. I truly want to
understand their method in order to identify them and expose them
(honestly, I have this urge to open a lecture, a school maybe, in
China, to talk to people of my findings, if any, so to apply these to
other stories audience can relate and see the common pattern.. what
can I say? I'm a big fan of patterns).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is probably viewed as an example of those epics of western
medicine vs. Chinese medicine. Here is a miracle doctor who treated a
patient …&lt;/p&gt;</description><dc:creator xmlns:dc="http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/">Feng Xia</dc:creator><pubDate>Mon, 28 Sep 2020 16:39:00 -0400</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">tag:fengxia41103.github.io,2020-09-28:/myblog/medical miracles.html</guid><category>thoughts</category><category>thoughts</category></item><item><title>Conflicting course</title><link>https://fengxia41103.github.io/myblog/conflicting%20course.html</link><description>&lt;figure class="col l6 m6 s12"&gt;

&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Watching this &lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ledJBbRfH8g"&gt;youtube&lt;/a&gt;, it suddenly occurs to me, what I have been
debating with myself &amp;mdash; the &lt;a href="https://fengxia41103.github.io/myblog/technology and society.html"&gt;technology and responsibility&lt;/a&gt;, why
technology needs to reflect on what this technology really means, even
in a hindsight, is better than ignoring its effect, has a root
cause. Yes, it is a &lt;strong&gt;fear&lt;/strong&gt;, that once we develop a powerful weapon,
the possibility that it falls into the &lt;em&gt;wrong hand&lt;/em&gt; is always
there. Therefore, the more powerful the weapon is, the worse a damage
it will do to us, when &lt;em&gt;abused&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That's it!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now, the question is, when I develop a technology, should I then
consider this possibility, or just brush it aside, "Hey, that's
someone else's job. Let me just focus on make this work." Can I, or
should I?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It seems obvious the answer is, no you shouldn't just ignore it. But
then, if the possibilities are endless, is theren't a way to prove its
negation, right? This is the same as &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/Physicists-Guide-Skepticism-Faster-Than-Light-Pseudoscientific/dp/0879754400"&gt;this book&lt;/a&gt; starting off that

  &lt;img src="images/DSC_1100384.JPG"/&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is an email w/ teammates regarding my thinkings on microservice
arch and a few other things happening in the project which I
dislike. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Read at your convenience ~~&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;SOA is hard, and I haven't seen it working&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I first learned &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Service-oriented_architecture"&gt;SOA&lt;/a&gt; (and an IBM &lt;a href="https://www.redbooks.ibm.com/redbooks/pdfs/sg246303.pdf"&gt;book&lt;/a&gt;, very comprehensive) in
2013. I was in charge of designing the architecture of a 3-million $$
project for a Fortune 500 company. Yes it was SOA-ed, but not, no one
can implement it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I have been in this trade long enough to see these patterns come and go,
every so many years they come back in a new emperor's
dress. Microservice arch seems to be the same thing. It's popular in all
meetings and talks. We assume ourselves ignorant if we can't name a
single project personally that has successfully pulled it off. But the
reality, I'm afraid, is that except a few deep pocket giants, no one has
done it according to book, and it never will.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;SOA requires a ESB (enterprise service bus) for messaging (data), and
&lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Business_Process_Model_and_Notation"&gt;BPM&lt;/a&gt; engine …&lt;/p&gt;</description><dc:creator xmlns:dc="http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/">Feng Xia</dc:creator><pubDate>Mon, 24 Aug 2020 09:48:00 -0400</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">tag:fengxia41103.github.io,2020-08-24:/myblog/my view on microservice arch.html</guid><category>thoughts</category><category>thoughts</category></item><item><title>Can you do this?</title><link>https://fengxia41103.github.io/myblog/can%20you%20do%20this.html</link><description>&lt;figure class="col l6 m6 s12"&gt;

&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The 1:1 meeting went pretty badly. Over the last 4 years I had been
working w/ this team and this person, and I'm having serious doubt of
the upcoming &lt;em&gt;new initiative&lt;/em&gt;. So feeling compelled I spoke up (yeah I
know, I tried to silent myself for a few weeks. But this is against my
view of integrity, really, by watching the rain derail without
sounding an alarm). But you know what? Negative message is never
welcomed, when there is a &lt;em&gt;positive&lt;/em&gt; one that is the mainstream. So
the conversation went like this:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A: "I need to see daily progress. If that is not happening, then
something is wrong and we should review it." (this is perfectly
reasonable).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Me: "I'm hesitating to promise such daily progress. Let me ask you
this. When was the last time you followed someone's blog to get the
result it says? In my experience it never happened. You copied and
pasted, and it didn't work. So you googled and found some other posts,
and out of some trials and with …&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;</description><dc:creator xmlns:dc="http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/">Feng Xia</dc:creator><pubDate>Fri, 21 Aug 2020 13:45:00 -0400</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">tag:fengxia41103.github.io,2020-08-21:/myblog/can you do this.html</guid><category>thoughts</category><category>thoughts</category></item><item><title>Earthquake</title><link>https://fengxia41103.github.io/myblog/earthquake.html</link><description>&lt;figure class="col l5 m6 s12"&gt;

&lt;p&gt;No kidding!!!! Earthquake!!! Wow. For the first time in life, and I'm
sincerely hoping this will be the last also, I experienced an
earthquake, and honestly, that was, scary!!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So while I was preparing breakfast, I heard this rattling sound from
my beloved Raaks shelf, then a sound of "stomp" coming from top, like
someone was running across the apartment upstairs. What the heck!? I
was thinking to myself, how could someone be running so heavily, and
how could it be so poor of sound insulation! But then, it didn't make
sense because the building is make of steel and concrete, and I
usually don't hear a soul while living here except the aisle door open
and close once a while. So how could it be!? So I reasoned that maybe
there is something wrong w/ my A/C that it was shutting down at the
time, thus making such a loud noise.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ha! Untill I was then chatting w/ Ariel, and she said she just
received a notification of an earthquake in NC!! .... So …&lt;/p&gt;</description><dc:creator xmlns:dc="http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/">Feng Xia</dc:creator><pubDate>Sun, 09 Aug 2020 11:46:00 -0400</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">tag:fengxia41103.github.io,2020-08-09:/myblog/earthquake.html</guid><category>thoughts</category><category>thoughts</category></item><item><title>Moving out, finally</title><link>https://fengxia41103.github.io/myblog/moving%20out.html</link><description>&lt;figure class="col l6 m6 s12 center"&gt;

&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Today is the day. Moved out, spending night at new place. No bed, just
a comforter on the floor. But it's ok. Had a fight w/ Noah,
again. Enough. I don't want to be hurt, and hurt him, anymore. It's
better this way.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Sitting here reminds me the days in Shanghai bnb, also a comforter on
a floor, cheap but manageable, and works for the purpose &amp;mdash; being
close to 泰康's shuttle bus stop, so I could visit dad everyday. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But now, what is the purpose? I'm lost. I miss bunny already. I wish
to hear her meowing now. She would be bored here. I know. It's better
for her to be there, there are just more things for her to chase, to
watch, to get excited, and perhaps, to dream about. So, what is this
life?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It's not a new life to me at all. It's an exile.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The other day on the way back from 517, Noah asked me why I bought
this place. I said the No. 1 reason was that …&lt;/p&gt;</description><dc:creator xmlns:dc="http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/">Feng Xia</dc:creator><pubDate>Mon, 27 Jul 2020 22:36:00 -0400</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">tag:fengxia41103.github.io,2020-07-27:/myblog/moving out.html</guid><category>thoughts</category></item><item><title>Tragedy in life</title><link>https://fengxia41103.github.io/myblog/tragedy%20in%20life.html</link><description>&lt;figure class="col l6 m6 s12 center"&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Dana called yesterday. Her older brother Michael, died. Had an uneasy
sleep last night. Went and got a beautiful bouquet, a card, and wrote
a letter. Too many memories coming back to me, reminds me
of 2006. It's hard. Such a thing, is always, hard. There isn't easy
way out. There isn't even a way out. It's a dead end, sad, dark,
lifeless. Stopped by Amy's house, Alan walked to the door, eyes are
red. I didn't know what to say, or what else to say. I couldn't
speak. It's hard for parents to lose a child, especially when they
themselves are old. I can't imagine how I can cope with such an even
if it happened to Noah later in life. I would probably survive, but
only half of myself will be left, if half can be left.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The pic I saw on the China trip kept popping up in my mind &amp;mdash; the

&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Saw an article on 知乎 the other day, titled &lt;a href="https://zhuanlan.zhihu.com/p/160928219"&gt;外国网友问：“为什么中国
禁了西方科技公司，却不满华为被禁？”&lt;/a&gt;. The content is pretty obvious
to guess then. Browsed the comments and I suppose author's responses
here and there, I got quite, concerned a view held by the article that
there is a difference between the Chinese ban of Google (to be more
precise, Google was not banned, but it chose not to conduct business
anymore &lt;em&gt;voluntarily&lt;/em&gt;), and the ban of Huawei &amp;mdash; China set up a
house rule, say, censorship, that applies to anyone conducting in his
realm, so it is an objective law regulating everyone, not just
Google. If you don't like it, I don't like you either. But US, on the
other hand, is actively talking to his &lt;em&gt;allies&lt;/em&gt; using carrots and
clubs to ban Huawei, with, according to the popular view, the sole
objective to choke Huawei, thus China, to death.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There is a logical fallacy, I …&lt;/p&gt;</description><dc:creator xmlns:dc="http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/">Feng Xia</dc:creator><pubDate>Sat, 18 Jul 2020 11:48:00 -0400</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">tag:fengxia41103.github.io,2020-07-18:/myblog/rule and fairness.html</guid><category>thoughts</category></item><item><title>Should I</title><link>https://fengxia41103.github.io/myblog/should%20i.html</link><description>&lt;figure class="col l6 m6 s12"&gt;

&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It is a very curious question, and it is a super fundamental question
&amp;mdash; the question of moral compass. Isn't there thing that we
shouldn't do, without reason/condition/excuse? If so, how do we
determine?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It all started w/ a &lt;em&gt;regular&lt;/em&gt; struggle with Noah and his homework
today. He didn't do his Kumon, but claimed he did. The conversation
went around and around with common excuse that "I can't focus" "why do
I need to catch up all these" "I didn't lie", and on and on and
on. Led him to the sidewalk outside the house, and asked him to rob a
car or a neighbour if no one is going to catch him, and he refused to
do so. So I was trying to make a point that there are things that are
wrong to do, thus we don't do it, regardless whether we will be caught
or what the punishment can be. Yes there is always a fear factor that
restrict our behaviors, and that's in the realm of law. But there is …&lt;/p&gt;</description><dc:creator xmlns:dc="http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/">Feng Xia</dc:creator><pubDate>Wed, 15 Jul 2020 20:45:00 -0400</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">tag:fengxia41103.github.io,2020-07-15:/myblog/should i.html</guid><category>thoughts</category><category>thoughts</category></item><item><title>Cart and Horse</title><link>https://fengxia41103.github.io/myblog/cart%20and%20horse.html</link><description>&lt;figure class="col l4 m6 s12"&gt;
  &lt;img src="images/social%20distancing.png"/&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It's a turmoil time, in America. It's a huge confusing time, that the
Corvid-19 is being used as a case in point that China has done a
brilliant job controlling the virus, while US is failing the &lt;em&gt;test&lt;/em&gt;
miserably, systematically. On top of all these, there is the racial
fight, that all lives matter, or some lives matter, or B life matters
(only?), and the looking back for redemption of historical sin, be it
slavery, Columbus being a terrible person (and he was, based on what I
heard on YouTube, and Noah confirms that), and so were the other many
famous figures whose statues are now being questioned, toppled, hailed
at its destruction, at its disfiguring, at its humiliation, at its
deglorification.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But then, it is a slippery slope, because, where would we stop? Whose
status can still stand if viewing in such a hindsight judging w/
modern day criteria, or moral threshold we believe today, but may not
be so back then? This is the same dilemma of the &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/Defense-History-Richard-J-Evans/dp/0393319598"&gt;In Defense of
History&lt;/a&gt; how …&lt;/p&gt;</description><dc:creator xmlns:dc="http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/">Feng Xia</dc:creator><pubDate>Sun, 12 Jul 2020 10:57:00 -0400</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">tag:fengxia41103.github.io,2020-07-12:/myblog/cart and horse.html</guid><category>thoughts</category></item><item><title>Racial</title><link>https://fengxia41103.github.io/myblog/racial.html</link><description>&lt;figure class="col s12"&gt;

&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There are many reflection articles these days after the George Floyd
event, and I found them quite interesting because I think there are
many problems in their implication and logic. The other day Noah and I
went to see a protest in downtown Chapel Hill, and a sign said
essentially "if you are not solution, you are part of the problem". I
knew this line at work, but now in this context, I found it misleading
also.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;right to be silent&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;First of all, the advocate to voice your stand. An article asking the
Chinese in America to take a stand and voice your opinion, because, if
you don't do so to support the ones in need, there would be nobody to
do for you when they come to you. That's the logic. But here is a
problem. In my view, the right of taking a stand of any kind, is the
same right as me observing a silence. They are the same right, equally
true, they are my decision. Period. The risk of being …&lt;/p&gt;</description><dc:creator xmlns:dc="http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/">Feng Xia</dc:creator><pubDate>Sat, 13 Jun 2020 22:57:00 -0400</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">tag:fengxia41103.github.io,2020-06-13:/myblog/racial.html</guid><category>thoughts</category><category>thoughts</category></item><item><title>Thoughtless</title><link>https://fengxia41103.github.io/myblog/thoughtless.html</link><description>&lt;figure class="col s12"&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Sitting here in the sun feels like Cambodia, humid, hot, the green
plants look greener after a day of rain, and w/ Noah fooling around
here and there w/ his primal bow and arrow, and Zhuzhu lying by the
feet. Peaceful, quiet, eventless weekend morning. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But somehow, my mind is disturbed, for things that I don't have a clue
what to do w/, such as the long Raak packages arrived on Tuesday
(320lb of them, and 15 ft long), what am I gonna do to get them over
to the new place? I don't know. But also, for the subtle feeling that
I wish I had more thoughts, things that anger me and make me want to
express, but then, not much I want to write about, because I don't

&lt;p&gt;Every since the &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/Wuhan-Diary-Dispatches-Quarantined-City-ebook/dp/B086JXGZFB"&gt;Wuhan Diary&lt;/a&gt;, the style is in fashion. Just a
moment ago I saw another by a cousin's friend, titled "华府日记"
(DC Diary), and it distinctly bears a, style, that I found rather,
strange.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It bears a style of smoothness and, calm, that, amid this Corvid-19
crisis &amp;mdash; essentially a barbarian-at-gate scenario while so
called your fate is out of your hand, and even so called authorities
are as clueless as your own, that appears you are jogging down things
around you, mostly &lt;em&gt;fact-based&lt;/em&gt; events, thus reading very much like  a
laundry list of neighbour A next door just died last night, the city
mayor has announced so and so on the news, and myself is running out
of food, and so on and so forth. So it conveys a silent sigh behind
all these words, as if putting a lid on a pot of boiling water. &lt;strong&gt;But,
that's where I find it strange!&lt;/strong&gt; &amp;mdash; even though it wants to make
a feeling of the hidden turmoil, it feels artificially,
philosophical.

&lt;p&gt;We use Jira for project manage, and git for code. W/ a plugin, Jira is
able to integrate w/ Gitlab such as create a link to git commit as
comment. However, it has not the capability to create statistic
analysis of git commits within Jira, for example, how to know the
number of line changes of a Jira (number of line changes are a good
indicator of workload as well as a hotspot of bugs), and vice versa,
how to know a commit is part of a release 5.1.1 (the &lt;code&gt;fix version&lt;/code&gt;
attribute in Jira)? If we are to generate a &lt;strong&gt;release note&lt;/strong&gt; of a
release, wouldn't it be nice if it listed out:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;list of Jira &amp;rarr; tasks the team wants to achieve in planning&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;list of commits &amp;rarr; actual code changes/contributions&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;statistics of grouped information such as number of commits by Jira
component, or label&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;developer contributions: who changed which file, and how much was
changed&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Further, when team follows a development workflow, such as the
&lt;em&gt;popular&lt;/em&gt; &lt;a href="https://nvie.com/posts/a-successful-git-branching-model/"&gt;git

it is …&lt;/p&gt;</description><dc:creator xmlns:dc="http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/">Feng Xia</dc:creator><pubDate>Fri, 01 May 2020 15:11:00 -0400</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">tag:fengxia41103.github.io,2020-05-01:/myblog/git and jira.html</guid><category>dev</category></item><item><title>Cart ahead of the horse</title><link>https://fengxia41103.github.io/myblog/cart%20ahead%20of%20the%20horse.html</link><description>&lt;figure class="col s12"&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Bumped into an article by the Google news directory, &lt;a href="https://www.statnews.com/2020/03/17/a-fiasco-in-the-making-as-the-coronavirus-pandemic-takes-hold-we-are-making-decisions-without-reliable-data/"&gt;"A fiasco in the
making? As the coronavirus pandemic takes hold, we are making
decisions without reliable data"&lt;/a&gt;, and its
follow up discussion that &lt;a href="https://www.statnews.com/2020/04/27/hear-scientists-different-views-covid-19-dont-attack-them/"&gt;"Scientists who express different views on
Covid-19 should be heard, not demonized"&lt;/a&gt;. I find them very
interesting because a recent event between me and Noah had echoed a
similar dilemma &amp;mdash; can we know ahead of time? or in other words,
are we constantly putting a cart in front of a horse?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Both questions sound pretty, stupid. Any common sense would say &lt;strong&gt;NO&lt;/strong&gt;
to both &amp;mdash; no we can't know ahead of time (as we often heard &lt;em&gt;no
one has a crystal ball&lt;/em&gt;), and certainly it's a bad sign if the cart is
put in front the horse (as my current project is perceived to
be). But, if the answers are so obvious, why do they even pop up, all
the time, and worthwhile to discuss? Let me first start the even w/
Noah.&lt;/p&gt;

I have some ideas. Most surely,
I want a big bookshelf as my Boston home, and I'm going to remove
kitchen wall cabinets to make them shelves also. I like open
spaces. Besides, I don't see point to put all the junks into cabinets
and drawers in order to hide them &amp;mdash; they will live there
forever, and I don't like this idea. I would rather them to be in the
open, if they are useful to me, so I will use them frequently, and for
things I don't use much, well, better not to have a space for them to
begin with. Don't you think so? So I think open shelves will make this
hiding activity less pleasant because I'll be looking at them and
become annoyed by them, so that will curb me buying them at the first
place. Good deal.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;my book shelf&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is 2nd version of it after a few email threads w/ Rakks. It's
coming together :)&lt;/p&gt;

that will reveal, and make you utterly aware, how lonely you are in
this world &amp;mdash; when you are faced to pick out a name to take care
of your aftermath, I flipped through my contact list over and over and
over, but no name jumps out.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;No, not Noah's mom. Period. The trust is gone, over. But then, who? I
thought of her, but then, she is so far away, and by the time I'm
dead, where will she be, and how much does she still know me then?
Does she know that I want to be put to death if the illness is too
dragging? does she know that I don't want to be put in box and buried
in the ground, but instead, finding me a bushes of flowers w/ plenty
sun, and just put me there, together w/ the plant, and may a breeze
brush me away? does she know that I'm afraid of pain, not really
afraid of death …&lt;/p&gt;</description><dc:creator xmlns:dc="http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/">Feng Xia</dc:creator><pubDate>Tue, 14 Apr 2020 12:58:00 -0400</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">tag:fengxia41103.github.io,2020-04-14:/myblog/will.html</guid><category>thoughts</category></item><item><title>Loss</title><link>https://fengxia41103.github.io/myblog/loss.html</link><description>&lt;figure class="col s12"&gt;

&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Today, Noah walked out the door, left, as a big fxxk you right to my
face. I'm really hurt.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The whole thing started that I prepared breakfast in the morning,
calling him coming downstairs to have breakfast. He came down in
T-shirt, walked to the screen door, "oh it's cold" (it's about 61
degrees outside), then went upstairs. I supposed he wen to grab a
sweater. Waited for a few more minutes, called him again, and from the
sound of it, I thought he went back to reading his book.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Then I got really turned off by him saying one thing and doing another
(yes we have had many conversations regarding this, but so far, no
improvement). So I went upstairs, and said that he could just dress
and go outside and play all day, and I didn't want to see him
during... and then I went back downstairs, put my food on the table,
and started eating. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After maybe 2 minutes, I went into to look for him, and he was,
gone. Mom got …&lt;/p&gt;</description><dc:creator xmlns:dc="http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/">Feng Xia</dc:creator><pubDate>Thu, 09 Apr 2020 14:36:00 -0400</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">tag:fengxia41103.github.io,2020-04-09:/myblog/loss.html</guid><category>thoughts</category><category>thoughts</category></item><item><title>Role model</title><link>https://fengxia41103.github.io/myblog/role%20model.html</link><description>&lt;figure class="col s12 center"&gt;

&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Don't take this as an April Fool's trick. Seriously, I'm also alarmed
how I could have changed, a 180 degree turn, from disliking this guy,
Bill Gates, when I was young, to today, I'm taking him as a role
model, and if he runs for president, I'll vote for him.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;An &lt;a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/opinions/bill-gates-heres-how-to-make-up-for-lost-time-on-covid-19/2020/03/31/ab5c3cf2-738c-11ea-85cb-8670579b863d_story.html#comments-wrapper"&gt;article&lt;/a&gt; by him on Corvid-19, simple, precise,
to the point, "Bill Gates: Here’s how to make up for lost time on
covid-19":&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There’s no question the United States missed the opportunity to get
ahead of the novel coronavirus. But the window for making important
decisions hasn’t closed. The choices we and our leaders make now
will have an enormous impact on how soon case numbers start to go
down, how long the economy remains shut down and how many Americans
will have to bury a loved one because of covid-19.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Through my work with the Gates Foundation, I’ve spoken with experts
and leaders in Washington and across the country. It’s become clear
to me that we must take three …&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;</description><dc:creator xmlns:dc="http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/">Feng Xia</dc:creator><pubDate>Wed, 01 Apr 2020 17:38:00 -0400</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">tag:fengxia41103.github.io,2020-04-01:/myblog/role model.html</guid><category>thoughts</category></item><item><title>Git strategy for backward compatibility</title><link>https://fengxia41103.github.io/myblog/git%20rebase%20strategy.html</link><description>&lt;figure class="col s12 center"&gt;

  Git strategy for a backward-compatible release
  &lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As a sequel to our discussion on &lt;a href="https://fengxia41103.github.io/myblog/git strategy.html"&gt;git strategy&lt;/a&gt;, we have started w/
an objective that we want to "control the release content". Further, I
discussed how &lt;strong&gt;backwards compatibility&lt;/strong&gt; of releases may not be true
if we are introducing long-term-support on releases, that hot fixes
and bugs can only &lt;strong&gt;roll forward&lt;/strong&gt;, eg. V4 bugs can be patched to V5
(assuming V5 was released after V4, time wise and git commit wise),
but not from V5 &amp;rarr; V4 without introducing some V5 contents into V4
(whether this is desired or not is the focal of the discussion,
essentially, how much control you want to have over the release
content!?)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now, let's build on top of this and say that &lt;strong&gt;we want backwards
compatibility&lt;/strong&gt; &amp;mdash; all newer releases are always backwards
compatible? This is certainly a desired outcome because this makes
upgrade and maintenance easier (who wants to maintain a 10-year-old
code when a customer &lt;em&gt;frozen in time&lt;/em&gt; call you of a bug which you
probably don't even remember who wrote that crap …&lt;/p&gt;</description><dc:creator xmlns:dc="http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/">Feng Xia</dc:creator><pubDate>Wed, 01 Apr 2020 11:42:00 -0400</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">tag:fengxia41103.github.io,2020-04-01:/myblog/git rebase strategy.html</guid><category>dev</category><category>thoughts</category></item><item><title>Corvid-19 Summit</title><link>https://fengxia41103.github.io/myblog/summit.html</link><description>&lt;p&gt;Spot a Chinese forum on Corvid-19 in WeChat, which says

&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://fengxia41103.github.io/myblog/git.html"&gt;git&lt;/a&gt; is wonderful, but its workflow is very confusing. Surprised?
Then I would dare to say that you haven't had first hand experience
using it in a full blown enterprise environment &amp;mdash; when in such
environment, the challenge isn't about git itself, but what the
content of a release are, and how we are testing/CICD them.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You would think it sounds rather cliche that this problem even
exists. After all, these are what a software engineering is all about,
aren't they? But take a step back and consider this scenario:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;We just did a release 5.0.0.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;We have two features: 1 &amp;amp; 2.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Initially they were all targeting the next release, say &lt;code&gt;5.1&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;We create a &lt;strong&gt;staging&lt;/strong&gt; branch, &lt;code&gt;5.1-staging&lt;/code&gt; and point our CICD to
   this so to QA them (more on this later).&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Feature 1 &amp;amp; 2 have been merged into &lt;code&gt;5.1-staging&lt;/code&gt;. Their source
   branches, eg. &lt;code&gt;feature-1&lt;/code&gt;, have been deleted &amp;larr; at merge
   request, select to delete source branch.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Time is slipping, 5.1 is up this Friday, but one feature is failing …&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;</description><dc:creator xmlns:dc="http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/">Feng Xia</dc:creator><pubDate>Sat, 21 Mar 2020 12:42:00 -0400</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">tag:fengxia41103.github.io,2020-03-21:/myblog/git strategy.html</guid><category>dev</category><category>thoughts</category></item><item><title>Feng's movie browser</title><link>https://fengxia41103.github.io/myblog/movie%20browser.html</link><description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://fengxia41103.github.io/movie/"&gt;Go to live demo&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;figcaption&gt;Movie browser demo&lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;h1&gt;Background&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Posted a challenge to build a &lt;em&gt;search&lt;/em&gt;/browser for movie
fan. Initially was given a static data set to display. So on top of
that, I start to pull in a few other data sources to spice things
up. Coded in React, which I found the ES6 syntax much cleaner.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;Development&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Install &lt;code&gt;nvm&lt;/code&gt; and node (tested 9.4, 12.1).&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;code&gt;npm install&lt;/code&gt;: to pull all dependencies.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;code&gt;npm run build&lt;/code&gt; because static files will be served from &lt;code&gt;/dist&lt;/code&gt;
   (defined in &lt;code&gt;webpack.config&lt;/code&gt;) by default. However, they can also be
   served outside the application entirely. See &lt;code&gt;Deploy&lt;/code&gt; section for
   more info.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;code&gt;npm run dev&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Browse &lt;code&gt;localhost:8080&lt;/code&gt;, browser will auto-refresh when webpack
   detects a change to source files.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;Deploy&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;using github pages&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Setup your github repo to allow pages, select using &lt;code&gt;MASTER&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Setup &lt;code&gt;develop&lt;/code&gt; as default branch.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;code&gt;npm run deploy&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;At prompt, login your github account.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Go to &lt;code&gt;&amp;lt;yourname&amp;gt;.github.com/&amp;lt;repo&amp;gt;&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;using your static file hosting&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;code&gt;npm run build&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Push &lt;code&gt;/dist&lt;/code&gt; to your static file hosting service.&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So the country is entering an emergent mode. Wanted to buy paper
towels on Amazon. Wtf, out of stock. And the infamous TP
rush. Seriously. Seriously? Went to Publix for some foods. Guess what
was gone the most!? Raw meat. No kidding. The items w/ the shortest
shelf life, gone. Are you guys planning for a siege, or a weekend
party? To my biggest surprise, cereal boxes are almost all there
&amp;mdash; so much for caring for children at home, or to survive a tough
time. And there were plenty breads of all kinds, and bakery had all
kinds of cakes &amp;larr; so it will be true then, "let them eat cake" ~~~
This is a joke, a grand joke on this society, and a joke on
mankind... I guess virus has always looked at us as jokes, a group of
self-centered, self-important, ignorant organs, fooled themselves to
think that they are dominating this earth. How pathetic!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There is a true cowardice inside us, not because we are coward, but a
strong tendency of lacking courage in face …&lt;/p&gt;</description><dc:creator xmlns:dc="http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/">Feng Xia</dc:creator><pubDate>Sat, 14 Mar 2020 08:59:00 -0400</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">tag:fengxia41103.github.io,2020-03-14:/myblog/cowardice.html</guid><category>thoughts</category><category>thoughts</category></item><item><title>Sherlock Holmes, and modern man</title><link>https://fengxia41103.github.io/myblog/sherlock.html</link><description>&lt;figure class="col l6 m6 s12"&gt;

&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Haven't been much a fan of Sherlock Holmes, but watched a &lt;a href="https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0988045/"&gt;movie&lt;/a&gt;,
which in the days of &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/index.html"&gt;COVID19&lt;/a&gt; all over the news and thoughts after
writing &lt;a href="https://fengxia41103.github.io/myblog/virus is coming.html"&gt;virus is coming&lt;/a&gt;, what Sherlock said made me think more on
what marks a modern man &amp;mdash; "There is no magic."&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I have ranted many times that there is no magic in engineering, in
coding, in anything that is concrete, material, real. Life itself has
no magic, it's messy, lots of loose gears fitting together, with a lot
of trial and error, and a lot of luck. So, there isn't magic in
becoming a modern man.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What is a modern man? What makes one qualified as one? I don't have
answer, nor there is any better than what I will be laying out
below. Living in the 21st century gives a perception that everyone is
now a modern man, because we are all living in a &lt;em&gt;modern&lt;/em&gt; society,
most of us at least, and cold war is over, we haven't slaughtered in a
global sense since the WWII, and more …&lt;/p&gt;</description><dc:creator xmlns:dc="http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/">Feng Xia</dc:creator><pubDate>Fri, 06 Mar 2020 20:20:00 -0500</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">tag:fengxia41103.github.io,2020-03-06:/myblog/sherlock.html</guid><category>thoughts</category><category>thoughts</category></item><item><title>Virus is coming</title><link>https://fengxia41103.github.io/myblog/virus%20is%20coming.html</link><description>&lt;figure class="col s12"&gt;

&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;News of the new virus coming to the States is all over the place now,
and the stock market has been dropping like a stone. Panic?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I haven't heard many people talking about it, life is rather running
as usual, but I think this is hanging on everyone's mind now, that we
are just waiting for a phone call from school that school is shutting
down, or an email from company that you are all required to work from
home for the next two weeks.. then what? what about food? drink?
necessities in life, gas, internet? &amp;mdash; there are so much
supports to make a modern life possible, that it's difficult to image
what it will be like when everyone, shuts down &amp;larr; even though I
felt quite annoyed by China's shutting down Wuhan city and locked down
its ten million residents on the issue of a government order, I don't
see other way around this. The difference probably will be, how people
fare well in this situation, not that whether we can dodge such
situation entirely …&lt;/p&gt;</description><dc:creator xmlns:dc="http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/">Feng Xia</dc:creator><pubDate>Sun, 01 Mar 2020 12:12:00 -0500</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">tag:fengxia41103.github.io,2020-03-01:/myblog/virus is coming.html</guid><category>thoughts</category><category>thoughts</category></item><item><title>SARS</title><link>https://fengxia41103.github.io/myblog/sars.html</link><description>&lt;figure class="col l6 m6 s12 right"&gt;

&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Sitting at coffee shop and after a cup of coffee, my mind is always,
springing back to life ~~ &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So it suddenly occurred to me, what happened SARS? I read all these
optimistic beats in wechat, and got seriously worried about what
people are deriving by shallow observation and an implied impatience
to end this misery as soon as possible. Who doesn't!? But the
documentary watched w/ Noah the other day, [Virus Empire: From SARS to
Ebola], made me feel quite otherwise from these sentiments &amp;mdash; the
Spanish Flu virus killed only 145 people in its first ran, but two
years later wiped 50 million &amp;mdash; no kidding, no shit, no
mercy. Again, like engineering work I do, sentiment counts for nothing
in the face of detail, practicality, and reality &amp;mdash; you can wish
however you want, the things will work when all gears match, or
collapse when a single screw is missing. That, is the life.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Googled SARS, the very first hit is by &lt;a href="https://www.who.int/csr/sars/en/"&gt;WHO&lt;/a&gt;, of course, and I has
no reason to doubt its credibility. It has …&lt;/p&gt;</description><dc:creator xmlns:dc="http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/">Feng Xia</dc:creator><pubDate>Mon, 24 Feb 2020 16:28:00 -0500</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">tag:fengxia41103.github.io,2020-02-24:/myblog/sars.html</guid><category>thoughts</category><category>thoughts</category></item><item><title>Burden of proof</title><link>https://fengxia41103.github.io/myblog/burden%20of%20proof.html</link><description>&lt;figure class="col s12"&gt;
  &lt;img src="images/burden%20of%20proof.jpg"/&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Had a chat w/ a friend yesterday after he showed a snippet of his chat
history, rather more accurately, of his argument history, w/ someone
in his circle about the ongoing corona virus outbreak. The argument
goes something like this:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yao: The traditional Chinese medicine is useless.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;B: What is your job? (Implying, are you a doc?)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yao: I'm a nobody, certainly not a medical personnel.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;B: Then you have no qualification to make such a claim.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yao: This is absurd. Why can't I have an opinion even if I had no
medical training?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;B: Cause you don't know what you are talking about.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So it goes on and on and on....&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is interesting, and actually quite common pattern that I have
witnessed over and over in chats, especially among Chinese. I sense
there is a logic flaw in this pattern, but haven't given it much
thought what this flaw is. But a word suddenly came to me &amp;mdash; 举证
倒置 (&lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reverse_onus"&gt;reverse onus&lt;/a&gt;), meaning to shift the burden of proof to the
party …&lt;/p&gt;</description><dc:creator xmlns:dc="http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/">Feng Xia</dc:creator><pubDate>Tue, 18 Feb 2020 08:29:00 -0500</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">tag:fengxia41103.github.io,2020-02-18:/myblog/burden of proof.html</guid><category>thoughts</category><category>thoughts</category></item><item><title>Heroes</title><link>https://fengxia41103.github.io/myblog/heroes.html</link><description>&lt;figure class="col s12"&gt;
  &lt;img src="images/hero.jpg"/&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I have stated a thought on heroes in a &lt;a href="https://fengxia41103.github.io/myblog/coronavirus.html"&gt;previous article&lt;/a&gt;. However,
after browsing the Wechat and saw all the posts of videos and articles
on cities sending medical teams to Hubei or Wuhan on a heroic trip as
if sending troops to the frontline, I have been thinking twice about
this word &amp;mdash; heroes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What are they? Are they commoners, who just got unlucky, caught by a
moment of history, that his/her saying turned out to be a reality,
thus they are now hailed as a prophet &amp;rarr; a smaller figure of God,
but a greater figure of human? Saw the news of Dr. Li's death
yesterday was heartbreaking. I felt I wanted to say something,
something nice about this person, something, showing off the bright
side of me, that I care, that I'm angry at the reality, that I have a
tender heart towards his tragedy .... but you see, everything I'm
laying out here, starts with an "I". &lt;strong&gt;The news was all over the
platform for exactly one day. One day!&lt;/strong&gt; &amp;rarr; Wechat is indeed …&lt;/p&gt;</description><dc:creator xmlns:dc="http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/">Feng Xia</dc:creator><pubDate>Sun, 09 Feb 2020 14:37:00 -0500</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">tag:fengxia41103.github.io,2020-02-09:/myblog/heroes.html</guid><category>thoughts</category><category>thoughts</category></item><item><title>Coronavirus</title><link>https://fengxia41103.github.io/myblog/coronavirus.html</link><description>&lt;figure class="col s12"&gt;
  &lt;img src="images/lyudmila.png"/&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The entire episode of 2020 Coronavirus is an ugly reality show. The
poor Dr. Li died, and it's really sad, and ugly, an ugly truth that a
hero was not born to be one; rather, they were becoming one by pure
accident because they stepped forward, unknowingly,  becoming &lt;em&gt;out of
line&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;em&gt;standing out&lt;/em&gt; among the crowd, at the &lt;em&gt;wrong&lt;/em&gt; time when a wave
of collapse was to sweep through.... Li didn't foresee the scale of
this epidemic; he is not a God. I don't believe anyone did, including
the scolded Wuhan mayor who "should have taken this more seriously"
&amp;mdash; nonsense!! Li, practically speaking, is a hero not because of
his prediction, but because of a mass sentiments brewing in the
background who are so fed up by the official bureaucracy and its
&lt;strong&gt;child-like reaction&lt;/strong&gt;, that they need one spokeman, an icon, an
image, to shout their minds in a safe distance &amp;mdash; and when this
&lt;em&gt;hero&lt;/em&gt; is in past tense, so the more convenient.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the end, praising someone to be a hero is nothing but …&lt;/p&gt;</description><dc:creator xmlns:dc="http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/">Feng Xia</dc:creator><pubDate>Sun, 09 Feb 2020 07:20:00 -0500</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">tag:fengxia41103.github.io,2020-02-09:/myblog/coronavirus.html</guid><category>thoughts</category><category>thoughts</category></item><item><title>Bucharest</title><link>https://fengxia41103.github.io/myblog/bucharest.html</link><description>&lt;figure class="col s12"&gt;

&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Luck to have this business trip and jumped on it at the last
minute. Even luckier that I switched seat on the way here at the last
moment, literally, when I found out I were going to seat next to
someone I didn't want to entertain, and it worked out quite nicely ~~&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Didn't know what to expect, except that I'm very much curious of the
country and wanted to check it out. And the most impressive thing I
found, people!! The people are just simply, beautiful, I mean,
cosmetically, by their looks!! It's rather stunning that so many guys
have grown big mustache, young and old, and boy, don't they have a
style!! So many of them walking in that fancy mall next our office
look like Beckham!! No kidding.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And don't even get me started on girls &amp;mdash; they are simply,
gorgeous! Every one of them is like 6ft tall, long straight legs,
beautiful beautiful hair, and the face! Oh, my, God! I took a random
bus from Downtown yesterday after walking for so long …&lt;/p&gt;</description><dc:creator xmlns:dc="http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/">Feng Xia</dc:creator><pubDate>Sun, 26 Jan 2020 11:55:00 -0500</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">tag:fengxia41103.github.io,2020-01-26:/myblog/bucharest.html</guid><category>thoughts</category><category>thoughts</category></item><item><title>Beautiful voice</title><link>https://fengxia41103.github.io/myblog/beautiful%20voice.html</link><description>&lt;p&gt;你是, 夜空中最亮的星&lt;/p&gt;</description><dc:creator xmlns:dc="http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/">Feng Xia</dc:creator><pubDate>Mon, 06 Jan 2020 12:23:00 -0500</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">tag:fengxia41103.github.io,2020-01-06:/myblog/beautiful voice.html</guid><category>thoughts</category><category>love</category></item><item><title>Moving on</title><link>https://fengxia41103.github.io/myblog/moving%20on.html</link><description>&lt;p&gt;After a long trip filled w/ surprises and tiredness, I'm&lt;/p&gt;</description><dc:creator xmlns:dc="http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/">Feng Xia</dc:creator><pubDate>Tue, 31 Dec 2019 08:44:00 -0500</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">tag:fengxia41103.github.io,2019-12-31:/myblog/moving on.html</guid><category>thoughts</category><category>love</category></item><item><title>Airport</title><link>https://fengxia41103.github.io/myblog/airport.html</link><description>&lt;figure class="col s12"&gt;

&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It must be how a king feels like, by sitting at airport, maybe sipping
a cup of Starbucks, and just watching people walking by &amp;mdash; isn't
it exactly the emperor's dream, that to have all the women in the city
walking right in front his eyes, so to pick/judge the one he likes!?
That's exactly how I felt when I was doing that ~~ But then, it isn't
a privilege a king has, right, I mean, you could just get a stool, and
sit by a curb in a city, and watch people going by like that
also.. But there is sth about airport, you can see how much effort a
woman puts in &amp;mdash; the dress, the shoes, the accessories, the air
she puts on, essentially, the image she is trying to leave to all
these strangers around her, interesting!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This makes me wonder, that being a super model must be extremely,
&lt;strong&gt;uncomfortable&lt;/strong&gt; &amp;mdash; after all, I think nobody in his/her common
sense will/should comfortable walking in front of some eyes whose sole
purpose is …&lt;/p&gt;</description><dc:creator xmlns:dc="http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/">Feng Xia</dc:creator><pubDate>Mon, 23 Dec 2019 12:04:00 -0500</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">tag:fengxia41103.github.io,2019-12-23:/myblog/airport.html</guid><category>thoughts</category><category>thoughts</category></item><item><title>Late night, city</title><link>https://fengxia41103.github.io/myblog/late%20night%20city.html</link><description>&lt;figure class="col s12"&gt;

&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When was the last time I was sitting by a window watching a city going
to sleep? Was it 2012 when I took Noah to Japan for the first time,
that I was sitting there, watching the city sleep, watching the city
wake up? Then, I was writing emails to Noah's mom, hoping the words
will get to her. But then, they never get responses, so the story
ended, w/ a sad ending, as expected.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now, I'm sitting at a window again, watching the city lights going out
here and there, less noise on the street, less cars going by, and
families of the building next become dark as ppl are also turning off
lights at home to go to sleep &amp;mdash; so here I am, ready to fly again
tomorrow, but sitting here, watching, writing, thinking. I tried to
feel you these days, but honestly, after spending time in your city, I
started to feel, less now of the memories &amp;mdash; I still wish you
could be next to me, someday, but I can't feel what …&lt;/p&gt;</description><dc:creator xmlns:dc="http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/">Feng Xia</dc:creator><pubDate>Sun, 22 Dec 2019 23:51:00 -0500</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">tag:fengxia41103.github.io,2019-12-22:/myblog/late night city.html</guid><category>thoughts</category><category>love</category></item><item><title>Mask, and random clips</title><link>https://fengxia41103.github.io/myblog/mask.html</link><description>&lt;figure class="col s12"&gt;

&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I wonder, whether human feels deep inside an urge, to hide behind a
mask, some sort of &lt;em&gt;shield&lt;/em&gt;, so to feel, safe, feel privileged among
peers, feel self-confident?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you notice, the premium spot of any coffee shop, is always the big
glass window facing outside, while you can sip your coffee, or just
sit there idling, while people watching, and while, maybe, be watched
by people going by. Why so? Why do we want to hide behind a glass
shield? From the inside, it feels that you are outside this world
looking in; but standing outside, don't you also become a fish in a
tank, quite pathetic in a box feeling good about yourself? I don't
know, but I find it to be very much true, to myself, as well as to
many many others &amp;larr; we like to sit by the window, to watch people,
and to be watched, and the drink, the price tag, the environment, all
become something standing behind me, so to make me feel, above the
ones outside &amp;mdash; and even …&lt;/p&gt;</description><dc:creator xmlns:dc="http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/">Feng Xia</dc:creator><pubDate>Sat, 21 Dec 2019 20:25:00 -0500</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">tag:fengxia41103.github.io,2019-12-21:/myblog/mask.html</guid><category>thoughts</category><category>thoughts</category></item><item><title>Be nice</title><link>https://fengxia41103.github.io/myblog/be%20nice.html</link><description>&lt;figure class="col s12"&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Can we be nice? Can we be nice to, strangers? Can we be nice
strangers?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Coming downstairs to grab a bottom water from a nearby convenient
store. There was a little girl w/ her mom, probably 8 years old,
walking in front of me, and she went out the build door first, then
held it open for two other girls behind them, then me. I thanks her
for being so kind.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But, they walked behind me in the same direction to the store, and the
mom just wasn't happy at all, "Aren't u stupid!? Why did you do that!?
They got hands, too, you know!? Why did you do that!?.... " So it went
on and on and on... what's wrong w/ these people!? I couldn't take it
anymore. I turned around, thanks the girl again, and said to the mom
"She did a good thing, you know? You should give her a compliment." I
also wanted to refute her of her idea of "they also get hands" line

&lt;p&gt;Does everyone has talent? With popularity of the smart phone, all of
sudden, everyone is now a photographer, generating tons of photos, and
some of them are actually quite pleasing. Why do they post them in
wechat? To get attention? compliment? or, just that, they think they
have a &lt;em&gt;hidden&lt;/em&gt; talent, thus waiting to be discovered?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We have heard the cliche that 千里马常有，而伯乐不常有. Once upon a
time I was thinking the same thing of myself. But now, I wonder,
whether it's truly so? Thinking of you this morning, while reading the
blogs I wrote over this year. I wish I could share them w/ you
somehow, and wonder how you would feel reading them. But then, I had
to remind myself that girls are usually a lot more practical than guys
at the same moment, that the decisions they make are actually quite
advanced, just that guys didn't understand. If looking at them as a
bystander, I have to agree w/ the girls &amp;mdash; and also …&lt;/p&gt;</description><dc:creator xmlns:dc="http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/">Feng Xia</dc:creator><pubDate>Thu, 19 Dec 2019 10:54:00 -0500</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">tag:fengxia41103.github.io,2019-12-19:/myblog/to be discovered.html</guid><category>thoughts</category><category>love</category></item><item><title>What is love</title><link>https://fengxia41103.github.io/myblog/what%20is%20love.html</link><description>&lt;figure class="col s12"&gt;

&lt;p&gt;What is it? I have written so much about this word, and have been
thinking so hard about what it is, but not until a few days ago, in
the evening, by the sunset, watching geese and ducks going home, w/ a
mountains far far away, no sound but the sound of ordinary country
life, when the old guy next door walking to his old lady, pulled out
his hand w/ some sunflower seeds, she reached out, w/ a big smile,
took them, and they stood side by side, just like, w/ all the wrinkles
testifying their identity and their tough life. Yet, they smiled, they
chatted, they were next to each other, in an arm's length, everyday,
every evening &amp;mdash; to them, this is not love, it's life itself
&amp;mdash; you don't label it w/ such exotic word, you simply live it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I asked the lady what she calls her Mr., "阿哥（gu er）", she smiled,
a bigger smile, on her face, when she was saying the words, 阿哥, so
sweet, so, sweet.

&lt;p&gt;Never thought there are so many musicians in this tiny little
city. But honestly, the first couple tunes got me &amp;mdash; so genuine,
touching, original. I like music, but I don't think music means the
same to me as to this person &amp;mdash; the music came from his inside,
he felt it when he played, he was the music, and the music gave peace
to him.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Met your uncle again tonight. He is a really cool guy. I was very much
surprised that he gave his diary (this is my understanding) to this
young guy whom he was taking in as hist very first student. That's
quite, bold, I would say. I'm curious what he has written in it. But
on the other hand, he showed quite well himself in this move and in
the little poem he wrote &amp;mdash; I felt he is in some kind of mood,
don't know what it is, that he decided to take in a student, but also
felt a bit awkwardness, I guess, thus saying that hoping he would be
able …&lt;/p&gt;</description><dc:creator xmlns:dc="http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/">Feng Xia</dc:creator><pubDate>Tue, 17 Dec 2019 09:31:00 -0500</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">tag:fengxia41103.github.io,2019-12-17:/myblog/musicians.html</guid><category>thoughts</category><category>thoughts</category></item><item><title>Funeral</title><link>https://fengxia41103.github.io/myblog/funeral.html</link><description>&lt;figure class="col s12 center"&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Human emotion, are the same.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Regardless gender, race, poverty, wealth, where you are from, what you
have been, what you are, emotions, are the same &amp;mdash; when you are
happy, you laugh; when you are sad, you cry.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I can't help crying over this picture. Picked it up off the book shelf
in 楠院, out of nowhere, here it is, a picture I truely feel the
emotion, that when you loved ones are leaving, how can't you not
feeling sad!? how can't you not feeling loneliness!? how can't you,
not cry!?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I have always felt that there is something about human's sadness, that
it's such a powerful, contiguous feeling, that if you are truly a
person that has not yet died inside, you will feel it, you will, as if
the event is happening to yourself, that it is really not something
external, strange to you, but part of you, part of your life.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;What an interesting trip so far! The host wants to take me to the old
town, which I initially thought would be a rather boring trip since I
don't really have much interest in the tourist stuff this time. Yet,
guess whom we ran into!?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Your uncle. What an odds!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;She is a famous person, apparently, in this little town, that just
about everywhere we went, there was someone who was nodding to her,
coming to her to chat, and smiled at her. And she had to stop often to
catch up w/ her &lt;em&gt;old&lt;/em&gt; friends and so on. Yet, completly unexpected, we
ran into him by the foot of the old city gate. Now watching the tiny
entrance to this new what I would call a private club, I suddenly
realized who he is, because the name of it rings a bell &amp;mdash; I
think you mentioned to me before.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yes, so here he is, sitting across to me, quite an interesting, and
different person, than I pictured &amp;mdash; he is very, real. I don't
think …&lt;/p&gt;</description><dc:creator xmlns:dc="http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/">Feng Xia</dc:creator><pubDate>Thu, 12 Dec 2019 15:06:00 -0500</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">tag:fengxia41103.github.io,2019-12-12:/myblog/run into.html</guid><category>thoughts</category><category>love</category></item><item><title>Tea Alley</title><link>https://fengxia41103.github.io/myblog/tea%20alley.html</link><description>&lt;figure class="col s12"&gt;

&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;By pure odds, I stepped into this tea alley &amp;mdash; just the kind I
was hoping to do in Chengdu. Yet, sitting there among all the old men
who were playing Mahjiong or pokers, I felt, old, felt, irrelevant,
felt, sad. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I wanted to write something, I did, but the words didn't carry how I
felt. I smiled, chatted w/ the old woman who was attending the tables,
had a good time listening to her life and her stories, and yet, I
felt, void, inside. Was it because of the shade that there was no sun
but only a clear day? was it because the lights were getting dim
towards the end of day when I sat down? was it because I waited too
long for my noodle to come, thus getting frustrated? or, was it
because, this is a city of you, and yet, I couldn't imagine how it
would ever be like sitting here, w/ you aside?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Will you like this setting? this type of life? Will you join me, if I
get this …&lt;/p&gt;</description><dc:creator xmlns:dc="http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/">Feng Xia</dc:creator><pubDate>Mon, 09 Dec 2019 17:24:00 -0500</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">tag:fengxia41103.github.io,2019-12-09:/myblog/tea alley.html</guid><category>thoughts</category><category>love</category></item><item><title>Revisit</title><link>https://fengxia41103.github.io/myblog/revisit.html</link><description>&lt;figure class="col s12"&gt;

&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For the first time in this trip that I can feel the time is finally,
all mine, that I can now plan for things I wanted to do, and see
people I wanted to see. Revisiting seems to be the theme of this trip
&amp;mdash; seeing old friends whom I haven't talked to face to face for
years, some I have been thinking to say something to but don't know
when or ever. Finally, I saw them all, talked to them all, visited
places I always felt I should in case I'm gone the next day. Less
regrets, more peace of mind, like paying back a debt, though the debt
is only on one's emotion, nonetheless it is there, often emerges into
my mind, calling me to settle it, someday, and that someday has
finally, realized.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The feeling after seeing all of them is rather, mixed. To some I can
feel the closeness, that our paths though have come apart, our minds
are still close; to some I feel the distance &amp;mdash; our lives have
all moved …&lt;/p&gt;</description><dc:creator xmlns:dc="http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/">Feng Xia</dc:creator><pubDate>Fri, 06 Dec 2019 18:37:00 -0500</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">tag:fengxia41103.github.io,2019-12-06:/myblog/revisit.html</guid><category>thoughts</category><category>love</category></item><item><title>Indirection</title><link>https://fengxia41103.github.io/myblog/indirection.html</link><description>&lt;figure class="col l6 m6 s12"&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I wonder whether the Chinese people have been used to reading,
indirectly &amp;mdash; so I was sitting on a cab going to the train
station this morning, and the driver had a music playing w/ a title
"30% of love and 70% of lie" (what a title, btw!) It's rather
unexpected and I asked him to play the song for me, nothing special,
just another those pop song that drivers and ppl who do labor works
like to hear, but the title caught my interest. So for a long time
since last time I took a picture of it and posted in my wechat, w/
some comments of love that whatever you do or think about love, just
don't lie, really, love is such a pure and beautiful thing, is such a
rare occasion in life, to put a lie into it is just, wrong.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But guess what!? Overwhelmingly the responses I received is all about
that inquiry whether I'm now back in China &amp;mdash; at the beginning I
felt rather annoyed by these, that it wasn't …&lt;/p&gt;</description><dc:creator xmlns:dc="http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/">Feng Xia</dc:creator><pubDate>Sun, 01 Dec 2019 12:25:00 -0500</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">tag:fengxia41103.github.io,2019-12-01:/myblog/indirection.html</guid><category>thoughts</category><category>thoughts</category></item><item><title>Square dance</title><link>https://fengxia41103.github.io/myblog/square%20dance.html</link><description>&lt;figure class="col s12"&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You wouldn't believe where I am writing this right now! I'm sitting at
this square by the subway station on my way back to my place after yet
another full day visiting my Dad and another relative, and here are
like hundreds of people square dancing, with the loud, rythmatic music
and cold air, and subway train running by the high rise bridge with
its own sound, fascinating experience!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I used to look down on these square dancers, thinking that they are
pretty loser by being entertained by such poor taste in public
space. However, I was having a different feeling this time. As a
matter of fact, I'm having a different feeling about a lot of things
this time in Shanghai &amp;mdash; at the beginning I contributed it to the
terrible cold I caught which made me really dizzy together w/ jet
lag. But I think there is another reason &amp;mdash; not that I'm getting
older, but that after watching my Dad and others slipping into the
valley of their life, I start to accept uncertainty …&lt;/p&gt;</description><dc:creator xmlns:dc="http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/">Feng Xia</dc:creator><pubDate>Thu, 28 Nov 2019 20:37:00 -0500</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">tag:fengxia41103.github.io,2019-11-28:/myblog/square dance.html</guid><category>thoughts</category><category>love</category></item><item><title>Philosophy</title><link>https://fengxia41103.github.io/myblog/philosophy.html</link><description>&lt;p&gt;These are notes of philosophy, which I'm finding more and more
fascinating. Starting w/ simple reading of different thinkers, I'm
hoping I will be able to develop a connection between popular
propaganda to its philosophical origin &amp;larr; not that these
propaganda were rooted in philosophy, but they have been dressing
themselves up to sound &lt;em&gt;philosophical&lt;/em&gt; by echoing thinkers' thoughts,
thus making people &lt;em&gt;believe&lt;/em&gt; they are deep &amp;mdash; the propaganda is
still BS, the thinker's thoughts are indeed, deep. So it is an act of
camouflage.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;Siddhartha Gautama (Buddha)&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;He was neither a messiah nor a prophet, and he did not act as a
  medium between God and Man. His ideas were arrived at through
  reasoning not divine revelation, and it is this that marks Buddhism
  out as a philosophy as much as a religion. His quest was
  philosophical &amp;mdash; to discover truths &amp;mdash; and he maintained
  that these truths are available to all of us through the power of
  reason.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Suffering is an &lt;strong&gt;inherent part of existence&lt;/strong&gt; from birth,

&lt;p&gt;I start to like coming to this YMCA lobby for work in the
afternoon. Coming here a bit earlier than Noah's pickup time, and I
can sit here just breathe the atmosphere, watching people coming in
and out in their gym clothes, listenning to a light music in the
background, tempted by the White Oak coffee right across to my table,
putting feet up on the bench, with a high ceiling of, I don't know, 20
fee or more, and knowing that at any minute I can go to see Noah, or
the kids will just come out to get their snacks here w/ their
counselor... all these thoughts, make me, happy, relaxed happy.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It was cloudy in the morning. But the temperature has been rising over
the day, and now there is sun, though it's getting close to be a
sunset now, so the Sun feels rather, relaxed also, that it beams its
heat here and there, but also dancing w/ this music, here and there,
no agenda, no purpose. Then, I thought of …&lt;/p&gt;</description><dc:creator xmlns:dc="http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/">Feng Xia</dc:creator><pubDate>Tue, 19 Nov 2019 15:51:00 -0500</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">tag:fengxia41103.github.io,2019-11-19:/myblog/ymca.html</guid><category>thoughts</category><category>love</category></item><item><title>Strange things of Javascript</title><link>https://fengxia41103.github.io/myblog/strange%20things%20of%20javascript.html</link><description>&lt;figure class="col l6 m6 s12"&gt;

&lt;p&gt;God, isn't Angular confusing! and I really think it is because of its
shaky underline language &amp;mdash; Javascript, is itself,
confusing. Well, even by just looking at its name, how many people
have thought that it is a &lt;em&gt;script&lt;/em&gt; derived from Java!? Oh well well,
here are some notes I take while studying Angular(JS, sometimes), and
&lt;code&gt;.js&lt;/code&gt;. Btw, there is another article about all the confusion of &lt;a href="https://fengxia41103.github.io/myblog/ecmascript.html"&gt;&lt;code&gt;ES&amp;lt;a
number&amp;gt;&lt;/code&gt; denotation&lt;/a&gt; that can clarify those naming/version hell.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;scope&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Scope is always the most fundamental concept I read of a language, and
for all I know, I'm expecting something like a &lt;code&gt;global&lt;/code&gt; and a &lt;code&gt;local&lt;/code&gt;,
that a local is always &lt;em&gt;private&lt;/em&gt; to its enclosed curly brackets or any
nearest declaration &lt;em&gt;chunk&lt;/em&gt; &amp;mdash; if it is declared in a function, it
is available in a function, not outside; if it is declared in a &lt;code&gt;for&lt;/code&gt;
loop, well, it is only useful inside the &lt;code&gt;for&lt;/code&gt; loop, not outside.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But there comes this country boy Javascript, and for the first time I
realized there are actually 3 scopes: global …&lt;/p&gt;</description><dc:creator xmlns:dc="http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/">Feng Xia</dc:creator><pubDate>Sun, 17 Nov 2019 13:13:00 -0500</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">tag:fengxia41103.github.io,2019-11-17:/myblog/strange things of javascript.html</guid><category>dev</category><category>dev</category></item><item><title>Is it fate?</title><link>https://fengxia41103.github.io/myblog/is%20it%20fate.html</link><description>&lt;figure class="col l8 m8 s12"&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Upcoming trip in six days now. For some reason I'm feeling anxious of
this trip since a few weeks ago &amp;mdash; a feeling of both excitement
and worry. Unlike the 2016 trip to 深圳, before which I had a
feeling before the trip that "something is going to happen", and I
meant something that is &lt;em&gt;big&lt;/em&gt;, and it did, I met her. This time the
feeling is more of an uncertainty because I don't know what is going
to happen, not much of self-confidence that "yes I will be ok", but
that if something happens, I don't know how I will come through, maybe
good, maybe bad.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Had a talk w/ Li Jian over Friday's lunch, about fate. Of course we
were just joking about whether there is such that we meant to see each
other at lunch time to have lunch, then I joked that I must not the
one in his pre-life to put a cover over his body when he was lying on
a beach &amp;mdash; a derivative of the 鸡汤 story …&lt;/p&gt;</description><dc:creator xmlns:dc="http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/">Feng Xia</dc:creator><pubDate>Sat, 16 Nov 2019 08:25:00 -0500</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">tag:fengxia41103.github.io,2019-11-16:/myblog/is it fate.html</guid><category>thoughts</category><category>thoughts</category></item><item><title>Software engineer</title><link>https://fengxia41103.github.io/myblog/software%20engineer.html</link><description>&lt;figure class="col l6 m6 s12"&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Had a chat w/ a young engineer on the team about career, technology,
what to study/learn. Whiling writing my responses, many thoughts came
to me, so I'm pasting the email here since I believe they are very
relevant in these topics, and they are truthfully represent what I
think about them.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;data structure, project Euler&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I don't recommend you study data structure or OS on paper at
all. There are three data structures you need to know, and they cover
90% of all cases you will ever encounter in your career &amp;mdash; array,
link list, and hash table. In Python's term, they are list -&amp;gt; array,
no equivalent -&amp;gt; link list, and dictionary -&amp;gt; hash table.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Pick a language you feel comfortable w/, and whatever the term they
use to describe these 3 data structures, read about them. There is no
better way to &lt;em&gt;study&lt;/em&gt; them other than finding a &lt;em&gt;real&lt;/em&gt; problem to
solve using these. I recommend you to try &lt;a href="https://projecteuler.net/"&gt;Project
Euler&lt;/a&gt;. They are pure mathematical
problems, and forces you to use these data structure &lt;em&gt;creatively&lt;/em&gt; for …&lt;/p&gt;</description><dc:creator xmlns:dc="http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/">Feng Xia</dc:creator><pubDate>Sun, 10 Nov 2019 15:06:00 -0500</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">tag:fengxia41103.github.io,2019-11-10:/myblog/software engineer.html</guid><category>dev</category><category>dev</category></item><item><title>Misconception</title><link>https://fengxia41103.github.io/myblog/misconception.html</link><description>&lt;figure class="col l6 m6 s12"&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I'm in a constant amazement how misconcepted this world is, by me, and
by many many others. Not only of this world as it is now, but the so
called history, things that have happened, have passed, should have
been written in stone, crystal clear, no ambiguity. Yet, when reading
a book like &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/America_and_Americans"&gt;this one&lt;/a&gt;, it's truly an eye opener that what I
thought I have known, what everybody thinks they have known, were not
so, were, perhaps, forgotten, or, were not understood in the first
place.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Sometimes I feel the history is playing a funny game, that by a common
sense, the longer you wait, usually the more faded the memory becomes,
thus the more likely what was remember became less and less &lt;em&gt;accurate&lt;/em&gt;
or &lt;em&gt;reliable&lt;/em&gt;, like what I have argued against in &lt;a href="https://fengxia41103.github.io/myblog/china nationalism.html"&gt;this article&lt;/a&gt;
that many of the Chinese elites are propogating the &lt;em&gt;main stream&lt;/em&gt; idea
of China's history with much distortion, which are obviously
&lt;strong&gt;illogical&lt;/strong&gt; because they failed in cross checks. But they were
&lt;em&gt;invented&lt;/em&gt; anyway so to fit for the needs …&lt;/p&gt;</description><dc:creator xmlns:dc="http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/">Feng Xia</dc:creator><pubDate>Thu, 07 Nov 2019 08:11:00 -0500</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">tag:fengxia41103.github.io,2019-11-07:/myblog/misconception.html</guid><category>thoughts</category><category>thoughts</category></item><item><title>Noah says</title><link>https://fengxia41103.github.io/myblog/noah%20says.html</link><description>&lt;p&gt;This is to keep track what Noah says these days, some smart
remarks. But first of all, let me vent what this kid is like, this
morning, that was totally pissing me off!! &amp;mdash; so I was cleaning
his glasses the last minute before leaving for school bus. There is
this missing piece off one of the legs, looked like the plastic has
been burned off by fire. So I asked what happened to it, he replied:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"I chewed it off." "But why!?" "&lt;strong&gt;I had this sudden desire to chew
   it.&lt;/strong&gt;" Said calmly and unshamefully. WTF!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So here goes the first line of his I'm writing down. So him.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Commenting on the new badminton coach he had in class. "This guy is
   all about power." "Oh so he was a power player. That's good."  "Not
   really. &lt;strong&gt;Sometimes power has to bow to wisdom.&lt;/strong&gt;" &amp;mdash; very
   philosophical, isn't it!?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;8:30 pm. Out of nowhere, after his Mom left for gym, he said to me,
   "爸，我决定了，等你有了517, 我和你 …&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;</description><dc:creator xmlns:dc="http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/">Feng Xia</dc:creator><pubDate>Thu, 07 Nov 2019 07:58:00 -0500</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">tag:fengxia41103.github.io,2019-11-07:/myblog/noah says.html</guid><category>thoughts</category><category>thoughts</category></item><item><title>No time</title><link>https://fengxia41103.github.io/myblog/no%20time.html</link><description>&lt;figure class="col l8 m8 s12"&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Sad, this is really sad, that I find no time to write down my thoughts
these days. When I had them, usually on the way to work, or was busy
cooking, I thought I would have them down a moment later. But when I
get to the office, immediately I got sidetracked into audition of
Jira, emails, meetings, meetings, meeting of meetings... this pattern
is just becoming too much a bore to my taste. I wonder how those great
author had been able to write what they wrote, while they themselves
must have had all the ordinary worries of life, good days, bad days, a
moment of light, and a long period of darkness? how did they do that?
Is overcoming these nuances the true struggle to deliver those master
pieces? Did these nuances actually make the author, I mean, in the way
that it hardens his/her will, sharpens his/her observation and
feeling, lets him to see through the superficial window dressing of
life, of the matter he was writing about, and forces …&lt;/p&gt;</description><dc:creator xmlns:dc="http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/">Feng Xia</dc:creator><pubDate>Thu, 31 Oct 2019 08:33:00 -0400</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">tag:fengxia41103.github.io,2019-10-31:/myblog/no time.html</guid><category>thoughts</category><category>love</category></item><item><title>Where</title><link>https://fengxia41103.github.io/myblog/where.html</link><description>&lt;figure class="col s12"&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I had a dream, so real, that I had you in my arms, and I buried my
head in your hair, kissed it, smelled it... oh how much I love you, my
dear, how much I miss you. You didn't say a word, but you smiled, so
beautiful, so real.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For the first time in my life, I hated to wake up, not just resent,
but hate. For the first time in my life, I couldn't tell what was real
and what is a dream. For quite  a moment I was sitting there on the
couch, not knowing what to believe, not knowing how to feel, because
it was so real, but it was only a dream.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Where are you? Are you safe? Are you having a good time? ... if only I
could know where you are now, and how you are doing. You know, I
looked up your &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Huili_County"&gt;hometown&lt;/a&gt; yesterday. It looks like a cute place,

&lt;p&gt;Though it is a Friday, actually just another Friday in life, in 2019,
weather is nice, went to the gym, didn't have much sleep last night
since Noah and I had a rough night, but my body felt fine, not
tired.. but for some strange reason, my mind, is very disturbed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I sense this strange timing this morning, that wherever I went, I ran
into some good looking girl or woman, and happened to be, that we will
across each other walking towards the same direction, but w/ them
always just a few steps behind me... to me, it is just a very strange
feeling that someone walk behind me like that, as if I were being
observed. I kept telling myself, don't be such a self-centered person,
who really cares about you anyway? Yet, it's just part of me since I
was little, that I constantly sense, or imagine, that their attention
was on me... well, what else to look at anyway, when there is just
someone walking in front of you, and not …&lt;/p&gt;</description><dc:creator xmlns:dc="http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/">Feng Xia</dc:creator><pubDate>Fri, 25 Oct 2019 10:02:00 -0400</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">tag:fengxia41103.github.io,2019-10-25:/myblog/unpeaceful mind.html</guid><category>thoughts</category><category>thoughts</category></item><item><title>S.T.E.M</title><link>https://fengxia41103.github.io/myblog/stem.html</link><description>&lt;figure class="col l6 m6 s12"&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Finally, I learned what is S.T.E.M &amp;mdash; &lt;strong&gt;S&lt;/strong&gt;cience,
&lt;strong&gt;T&lt;/strong&gt;echnology, &lt;strong&gt;E&lt;/strong&gt;ngineering, &lt;strong&gt;M&lt;/strong&gt;ath, and here is a &lt;a href="https://news.slashdot.org/story/19/10/23/1851224/the-worlds-top-economists-just-made-the-case-for-why-we-still-need-english-majors"&gt;slashdot&lt;/a&gt;
opinion on why we still need an English major.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I can't agree more.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I believe we are living in an era in which science, technology,
development, progress are being hailed as the new gospel. As if they
bring no burden but only solve the existing problem, we treat them as
a free lunch while each one of us are well versed that there is no
free lunch, of any kind, ever. Instead, they are wonderful but not
magical; they solve things while creating new issues &amp;mdash; it's the
natural course of progress, of course, but they shouldn't be set in an
altar. On the contrary, I think we need more debates on its
&lt;a href="https://fengxia41103.github.io/myblog/technology responsibility.html"&gt;responsibility&lt;/a&gt; and its role in the &lt;a href="https://fengxia41103.github.io/myblog/technology and society.html"&gt;society&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Education, another buzz word that is forever on any adult's mind

&lt;li&gt;Loading browser is too slow &amp;larr; how many times I just want to
   get a view of the comment or description so to refresh my memory.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Navigating from one ticket to another is to open a new tab, but
   that just clutter my browser. Very soon I don't remember which tab
   is for which ticket, so ended up openning the same jira over and
   over.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;To switch its status is again, to load page, click some kind of
   dropdown, then click to select &amp;rarr; 3 clicks. No, I already know
   what status I want it to be, so I want to simplify this.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;#3 also applies to reassign a ticket to someone &amp;mdash; there are
   usually only a handful ppl you deal w/ on a daily basis during
   development. Instead of waiting for the spinning wheel to come up
   the name, just memorize the user's name, and assign.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;This is actually the very first reason got …&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;</description><dc:creator xmlns:dc="http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/">Feng Xia</dc:creator><pubDate>Wed, 23 Oct 2019 13:00:00 -0400</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">tag:fengxia41103.github.io,2019-10-23:/myblog/jira.html</guid><category>dev</category></item><item><title>Linux Terminator cheatsheet</title><link>https://fengxia41103.github.io/myblog/linux%20terminator%20cheatsheet.html</link><description>&lt;p&gt;Linux Terminator keybinding cheat sheet.&lt;/p&gt;</description><dc:creator xmlns:dc="http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/">Feng Xia</dc:creator><pubDate>Fri, 11 Oct 2019 11:34:00 -0400</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">tag:fengxia41103.github.io,2019-10-11:/myblog/linux terminator cheatsheet.html</guid><category>dev</category><category>dev</category></item><item><title>Git</title><link>https://fengxia41103.github.io/myblog/git.html</link><description>&lt;p&gt;Tips on git.&lt;/p&gt;</description><dc:creator xmlns:dc="http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/">Feng Xia</dc:creator><pubDate>Wed, 09 Oct 2019 13:18:00 -0400</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">tag:fengxia41103.github.io,2019-10-09:/myblog/git.html</guid><category>dev</category><category>thoughts</category></item><item><title>My system</title><link>https://fengxia41103.github.io/myblog/my%20system.html</link><description>&lt;p&gt;Instructions to rebuild my system from scratch based on Ubuntu 18.04.&lt;/p&gt;</description><dc:creator xmlns:dc="http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/">Feng Xia</dc:creator><pubDate>Tue, 08 Oct 2019 19:05:00 -0400</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">tag:fengxia41103.github.io,2019-10-08:/myblog/my system.html</guid><category>dev</category><category>dev</category></item><item><title>Smart phone</title><link>https://fengxia41103.github.io/myblog/smart%20phone.html</link><description>&lt;figure class="col l8 m8 s12"&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I have long been wanting to discuss this topic &amp;mdash; smart
phone. This discussion/thought had started in 2014 when I was in 太原
and was chatting w/ 谢部 at a Starbucks downstairs near her
office. Out of my own experience w/ this type of devices &amp;mdash; a 红
米 given by my uncle, then later a new one I bought myself, w/o any
previous experience in the States before I went (I insisted using a
cheap flip phone back then), thus was forcing myself to use a smart
phone with nothing but practical purpose &amp;mdash; to communicate w/
family and colleague and customer, to navigate the places completely
strange to me, and so on &amp;rarr; thus, I consider this experience to be
quite fresh and genuine because it has no prefix, nor bias. Besides,
considering myself to be a tech person, I didn't expect there would
have been much a barrier to adopt the new trend, and enjoy it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But, my opinion was, and still is, that:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;It is not smart at all.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;As a …&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;</description><dc:creator xmlns:dc="http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/">Feng Xia</dc:creator><pubDate>Sat, 05 Oct 2019 08:42:00 -0400</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">tag:fengxia41103.github.io,2019-10-05:/myblog/smart phone.html</guid><category>thoughts</category><category>thoughts</category></item><item><title>What we know is untrue</title><link>https://fengxia41103.github.io/myblog/what%20we%20know%20is%20untrue.html</link><description>&lt;figure class="col l8 m8 s12"&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The more we read, the more I think, the more I start to realize how
many of things I know, are untrue. This, is disturbing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Reading the &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0670116025/ref=dbs_a_def_rwt_hsch_vapi_thcv_p3_i4"&gt;America and Americans&lt;/a&gt; by John Steinbeck, I was rarely
touched by a book because it spells so many points which I feel, I
think, and agree. This is a great book with great insights, and are
honest about the past and the present (as of 1966).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Indeed, so many things we have learned, thought to be the case, are
not so. America and Americans are full of paradox &amp;mdash; the early
settlers lived with full intent &lt;strong&gt;not to mix with anyone who is unlike
themselves, by religion, by race, by land of origin, by whatever the
moral compass they held dear&lt;/strong&gt;. Yet, this country becomes the most
diversified mixing pots of everything, normal and eccentric, ordinary
and extraordinary, mediocre and polarized. Fascinating.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So here I'm going to document things of the untrue:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;woman lives longer than man, polygamy&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Watching Noah to do homework these days is like watching paint dry
&amp;mdash; a true challenge of patience, and the result is often very
disastrous. His mom decides to &lt;em&gt;work with him&lt;/em&gt;, but by my observation,
it's more or a less a shouting contest, and Noah showed a strong sign
of rebellion. It makes me both happy because I know he is going into
his teens and is on the track of his development, and mad because his
rebellious attitude, to his mom in particular, has been there since
young, and I worry whether he is also doing so at school, which then
will not abide well w/ others... and, is this why he is having
difficulty to make friends? I have been deliberately skipping to walk
him to bus last few days cause I wanted to give him his own room to
meet and chat w/ his bus friends. But I also know that before long I
won't be part of his routine and life anymore even if I want to join
&amp;mdash; the option window …&lt;/p&gt;</description><dc:creator xmlns:dc="http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/">Feng Xia</dc:creator><pubDate>Thu, 26 Sep 2019 09:47:00 -0400</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">tag:fengxia41103.github.io,2019-09-26:/myblog/middleschool.html</guid><category>thoughts</category><category>thoughts</category></item><item><title>Snapshot anything w/ Selenium</title><link>https://fengxia41103.github.io/myblog/snapshot%20selenium.html</link><description>&lt;figure class="col l6 m6 s12"&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In my previous notes on &lt;a href="https://fengxia41103.github.io/myblog/analyzing angular 1x.html"&gt;analyzing Angular 1.x code&lt;/a&gt;, I have stuck at
how to create snapshots of rendered components for my documentation
purpose. In the manual data file &lt;code&gt;.json&lt;/code&gt;, I allowed an entry to plug
in snapshot file taken by human testers. As an example, the code below
shows a block documenting:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;module: &lt;code&gt;mwc.mapping&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;its components as a LIST, and each has a key &lt;code&gt;screenshot&lt;/code&gt; that is a
   path to the snapshot file.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;div class="highlight"&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Well, this gets me going to create the &lt;a href="https://fengxia41103.github.io/myblog/downloads/webapp.pdf"&gt;example doc&lt;/a&gt;, but to have
human hunting down screenshots always give me a fishy feeling &amp;mdash;
you know how deeply I do not trust human to be &lt;strong&gt;exhaustive&lt;/strong&gt; and
&lt;strong&gt;deterministic&lt;/strong&gt; &amp;mdash; on a good day or w/ a capable person, yes,
you get a pretty satisfactory result, but even then, it's no guarantee
his/her next day's delivery will be the same.

&lt;p&gt;While at gym, the thought just came to me, that all the talks about AI
have been about how it will obsolete human and jobs, how much
acceleration it travels in term of cracking the challenges we throw at
it/them, therefore how much we will be behind once the AI train passes
us &amp;mdash; louder, louder, louder.. and it's, gone! and we will never
catch up again, ever. Then the world will be dominated by AI and its
creations (robots?), and human, likely will become slaves, or like in
the Matrix, some sort of utilitarian object, fertilizer, maybe.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Then, the talks inevitably lead to gaps that AI can not yet do, and
even argue that they will never able to. Two common threads &amp;mdash;
language, and emotion.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Language that there are too much subtlety in our conversation (and the
Chinese especially think they are the master of such, in their eyes,
arts, in my eyes, annoyance, see my elaboration on &lt;a href="https://fengxia41103.github.io/myblog/irresponsible response.html"&gt;irresponsible
response&lt;/a&gt;), that AI/computer is yet to understand that much depth

The core of it is how to evaluate your
code base to pick up interested artifacts &amp;larr; brand
indicator. Definition of these artifacts are highly contextual,
meaning that a string &lt;code&gt;feng&lt;/code&gt; can mean a variable, or a string literal,
or something else. Think of it, how many programming languages in your
application stack, and how many different comment styles there are!?
Crazy.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So let's start w/ the most basic &amp;mdash; string literal &amp;mdash; if I
find a string &lt;code&gt;whatever&lt;/code&gt; (old brand), replace it w/ &lt;code&gt;feng&lt;/code&gt; (new
brand).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;the how&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The script can be found &lt;a href="https://github.com/fengxia41103/dev/blob/master/code%20analysis/fancy_string_search.py"&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;. The idea is to:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Walk through &lt;code&gt;root&lt;/code&gt; folder and its subfolders and files.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;File is selected by its extension &amp;mdash;  an exclusion list and an inclusion
   list. Exclusion has a default list to exclude all binary formats,
   eg. &lt;code&gt;.png&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Open the file as text file, search line by line whether interested
   pattern in found.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If found, log down the file full path, line number, and original
     line text.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Identify &lt;code&gt;reference&lt;/code&gt;, which is defined as &lt;code&gt;/&amp;lt;.....&amp;gt;&lt;/code&gt; &amp;mdash; this
   covers reference to a …&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;</description><dc:creator xmlns:dc="http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/">Feng Xia</dc:creator><pubDate>Wed, 11 Sep 2019 16:15:00 -0400</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">tag:fengxia41103.github.io,2019-09-11:/myblog/rebranding.html</guid><category>dev</category><category>lenovo</category></item><item><title>Analyzing Angular 1.x code</title><link>https://fengxia41103.github.io/myblog/analyzing%20angular%201x.html</link><description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://github.com/compodoc/compodoc"&gt;Compodoc&lt;/a&gt; can generate component hierarchy diagrams, call chains,
but it didn't work for Angular 1.x code. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The goal is to &lt;strong&gt;create a lookup/catalogue between code and visual&lt;/strong&gt;
because everyone on the team, including UI devs, can only engage a
discussion using the visual (the rendered look) &amp;mdash; so far, I
haven't been able to develop the capability to &lt;em&gt;see&lt;/em&gt; how it will look
like by just staring at code.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This issue gets compounded when components are calling each other
&amp;mdash; some pages are calling all kinds of components, and these
components are in turn used in all sorts of &lt;em&gt;parent&lt;/em&gt; pages. This
presents an issue how to knows its effect when, say, I'm taking a task
to change this component? Without such a cross reference, I'm
completely in the dark. Think about this, if component A is used in 3
places, we should have 3 test cases just to be sure it doesn't break
the visual.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This leads me to a google search and I think the term for what I'm
thinking is &lt;a href="https://storybook.js.org/docs/testing/automated-visual-testing/"&gt;visual regression …&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</description><dc:creator xmlns:dc="http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/">Feng Xia</dc:creator><pubDate>Sun, 01 Sep 2019 17:58:00 -0400</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">tag:fengxia41103.github.io,2019-09-01:/myblog/analyzing angular 1x.html</guid><category>dev</category><category>angular</category><category>lenovo</category></item><item><title>Internet</title><link>https://fengxia41103.github.io/myblog/internet.html</link><description>&lt;figure class="col s12"&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I started this article a few days, but didn't finish it. A few mixed
thoughts have been lingering around my mind for quite some. But they
are rather elusive &amp;mdash; they come and go, and on the moment when I
felt them, I was always busy with something else. Then by the time I
sat down to write, I couldn't think of them anymore. So let me try
them again.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is a topic I have long been writing, that I think the internet is
in trouble.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What's the value of the Internet these days? I used to think, and I
think most people will take it as the No. 1 value of the Internet, is
that it has made information (&lt;strong&gt;not knowledge, and leave alone truth,
fact, reality, those kind of words&lt;/strong&gt;) readily available at your finger
tip. But then, we do have to ask, what is the use of information? The
answer will be, it depends &amp;mdash; certainly an information of the
a sale going on in a McDonald's next door will not help you …&lt;/p&gt;</description><dc:creator xmlns:dc="http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/">Feng Xia</dc:creator><pubDate>Sun, 01 Sep 2019 17:47:00 -0400</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">tag:fengxia41103.github.io,2019-09-01:/myblog/internet.html</guid><category>thoughts</category><category>thoughts</category></item><item><title>Nagasaki</title><link>https://fengxia41103.github.io/myblog/nagasaki.html</link><description>&lt;div class="col s12" style="margin-right: 2em;"&gt;

&lt;p&gt;What a fine early Autumn day, nice weather, nice temperature, nice
breeze. Noah's first day to the middle school. His bus left at 7:36,
so the day all started early, which feels, great, that I have done the
gym and have checked my emails, and now can write down some thoughts
before noon. Like it, except for the mosquito who just bited me, but
unfortunately it landed on the seat next to mine, and SQUASH, it's
now, dead &amp;larr; does monk kill mosquitoes? I mean, do they consider
them a form of life also, so that by their religious code that they
shouldn't harm them either? or, they classify mosquitoes as a
different kind, like 妖魔鬼怪 in 西游记, that can be killed at will?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Talking about 西游记， this is what brought me to write this article
&amp;larr; Noah and I were riding back from Reader's Corner (btw, I picked …&lt;/p&gt;</description><dc:creator xmlns:dc="http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/">Feng Xia</dc:creator><pubDate>Mon, 26 Aug 2019 10:28:00 -0400</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">tag:fengxia41103.github.io,2019-08-26:/myblog/nagasaki.html</guid><category>thoughts</category><category>love</category></item><item><title>Boston and other thoughts</title><link>https://fengxia41103.github.io/myblog/boston%20and%20other%20thoughts.html</link><description>&lt;figure class="col l8 m8 s12"&gt;

&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Trip to Boston was nice, especially when I saw old friends &amp;mdash;
uncle Tam, Eddy, Bob, Doc Shen and his parents. Not that it brought
back many memories, but to see that people who have been in my life,
of whom I wish to have a good life, are doing well. I think somewhere
I have said it, that it matters more to me that the people I care
about are living well, than myself does the same. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I don't know. I have many thoughts this morning, but they come and go,
and hard to put them down. I have been thinking a lot of the last ten
years, the years since Noah came to my life. What a change! It's easy
to say that change was taken because of him. Of course he was a major
force behind these changes. But I can't help feeling there were more

is that human can &lt;strong&gt;make belief&lt;/strong&gt;, that we can imagine things, a
scenario, a life, that does not exist. Therefore we invented arts,
movies, music, literature &amp;larr; all the existence that human can be
proud of, and the only things that human bring to this world which are
not put there by nature or God, are these imaginary things, make
belief.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I start to seriously wonder whether this speaks the fundamental truth
of being, of what I feel, what I puzzle about, and what I sense.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Walking back from gym, bright sunny day. Listening to this song,
[Night in Ulaanbaatar][1], I couldn't tell anymore I was walking in
light, or in darkness &amp;mdash; the lights were blinding, barely any
breeze, but comfortable dry air and comfortable temperature. Yet, my
mind can only feel the wind, a breeze over the night of this remote
city, which I have never been, and may will never be, 袅袅炊烟,
sparsed lights here and there, a …&lt;/p&gt;</description><dc:creator xmlns:dc="http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/">Feng Xia</dc:creator><pubDate>Tue, 30 Jul 2019 10:55:00 -0400</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">tag:fengxia41103.github.io,2019-07-30:/myblog/ulaanbaatar.html</guid><category>thoughts</category><category>love</category></item><item><title>People</title><link>https://fengxia41103.github.io/myblog/people.html</link><description>&lt;figure class="col s12"&gt;
  &lt;img src="images/bunny%20not%20happy.jpg"/&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;What is people? I thought I had it figured out, but now I start to
wonder whether I'm witnessing another make-belief episode in the human
history when an abstract word such as this being used, abused, taken
for granted, without explanation, as if everybody recognizes its
meaning, knowing its intention, understanding its logic, and accepting
its implication.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This, is troublesome, and sometimes I feel the word "troublesome" is
too light a word to describe the evil such usage is releasing &amp;mdash;
it's like a poison released in those Nazi gas chamber, odorless, even
painless. Yet, however long it takes, however &lt;em&gt;unintrusive&lt;/em&gt; it is, it
kills.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So, what is people? When I thought I figured it out, I thought the key
problem of this word is that citizen is a given right come with your
birth &amp;mdash; you are a citizen of such country, when you were born
here, or sworn in, and thus being regulated by and abiding the
country's law &amp;mdah; it's both an identity as you own a passport when
travel which says who you are …&lt;/p&gt;</description><dc:creator xmlns:dc="http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/">Feng Xia</dc:creator><pubDate>Wed, 24 Jul 2019 11:33:00 -0400</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">tag:fengxia41103.github.io,2019-07-24:/myblog/people.html</guid><category>thoughts</category><category>thoughts</category></item><item><title>I don't think so</title><link>https://fengxia41103.github.io/myblog/i%20dont%20think%20so.html</link><description>&lt;figure class="col l6 m6 s12"&gt;
  &lt;img src="images/dinasaur.jpg"/&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It's a common scene comparing ancient time vs. today, and the common
context of such comparison is that people in today's world, enabled by
information revolution and its technologies, is overwhelmed by these
bits in term of sensibility, thus deriving a conclusion that either we
are becoming less and less sensitive, or that we are smarter than
before. The former, however, I disagree.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It's easy to picture someone sitting in front of a TV these days and
his sense is being saturated by violence, vulgarity, and sex, the
three element that, according to &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/Problem-Media-Communication-Politics-Twenty-First/dp/1583671056"&gt;this book&lt;/a&gt;, are the forever
winner if you want to sell in a commercialist world. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;However, I have long been thinking that the so called ancient time has
been romantized in the same way that we view history in our lens
&amp;mdash; what we deem as evil and barbarian back then was not really so
if you entered a time machine and truly lived in it; same applied to
glories and achievements, and I'm sure same is true for everything
between. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/JScript"&gt;JScript&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CoffeeScript"&gt;CoffeeScript&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Microsoft_TypeScript"&gt;TypeScript&lt;/a&gt;... what the heck!?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;figure class="col s12"&gt;
  &lt;img src="images/ecmascript%20relationship.png"/&gt;
  &lt;figcaption&gt;Feng's view of how these confusing Javascript words are
  linked together&lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;h1&gt;spec&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The mother of all is the &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ECMAScript"&gt;ECMAScript&lt;/a&gt;, which is the spec. It has
some wild release notion and cycles. The important one for me is the
&lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ECMAScript#6th_Edition_-_ECMAScript_2015"&gt;ES2015&lt;/a&gt;, and I think starting from that release, the schedule
becomes annual, thus we have &lt;code&gt;ECMAScript 2016&lt;/code&gt; and so on. Since the
2015 release is the &lt;strong&gt;6th&lt;/strong&gt; revision of the spec, thus also created
the notion &lt;code&gt;ES6&lt;/code&gt; (&lt;code&gt;ES2015&lt;/code&gt; ==  &lt;code&gt;ES6&lt;/code&gt;).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;spec implementation&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Javascript, together with &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/JScript"&gt;JScript&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ActionScript"&gt;ActionScript&lt;/a&gt;, are
implementation of this spec, and of course, by different
companies. The problem is, each implements some subset of the spec,
thus there are overlaps as well as incompatibilities. Sucks!
Therefore, when reading some Javascript articles, there is always
reference to &lt;code&gt;ES6&lt;/code&gt; compatible or a feature, which means whether the
Javascript implementation is up to that spec's release, or not.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;javascript engine and compatibility&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ok. Here comes the giant twist &amp;mdash; starting when the spec
committee decides that before …&lt;/p&gt;</description><dc:creator xmlns:dc="http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/">Feng Xia</dc:creator><pubDate>Wed, 03 Jul 2019 14:15:00 -0400</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">tag:fengxia41103.github.io,2019-07-03:/myblog/ecmascript.html</guid><category>dev</category><category>thoughts</category></item><item><title>Self-selected bias</title><link>https://fengxia41103.github.io/myblog/self-selected%20bias.html</link><description>&lt;figure class="col s12"&gt;
  &lt;img src="images/beautiful%20stare.jpg"/&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I wonder, whether the bias that I feel, is actually self-selected!?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This occurred to me when I was browsing Slashdot at lunch, and started
to realize that as a pattern which applies to everybody, you will only
click into the comment for the titles you find interesting &amp;mdash;
this sounds very much legit and correct.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But, wouldn't it enforce your interest in a certain topic because,
like Noah's swimming practice, the more you practice, the better you
become. Thus, the more you read about a certain topic, which started
with a vague interest perhaps, the more you know about the content and
topic and context, the more then you find the consequent reports and
similar topics easy to understand, and more likely to provoke an
emotion, which makes you feel the topic is dearer to you than others.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Another proof of this is that when I was reading the title
&lt;a href="https://science.slashdot.org/story/19/07/02/0657238/researchers-identify-the-origins-of-metabolism"&gt;Researchers Identify the Origins of Metabolism&lt;/a&gt;, 53 comments,

&lt;p&gt;Hmmm... this &lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dTEHB6fOFWc"&gt;video&lt;/a&gt; is very...disturbing.. and the comments below
are even more so, disturbing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Before anything, I think this person is a thinker. It's actually very
good, and I think he is very smart and observant, and he certainly is
not following some made recipe &amp;rarr; he is formulating a logic of his
own, which he intentionally (and I think he is very much like me) to
be different from others'. I usually will very much enjoy someone like
this. But, but, his view point, well, is putting me off, completely.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;Geo type&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Number one, he has a completely wrong view by making a statement that
US is behaving irresponsibly because it has the gene of a &lt;em&gt;pirate&lt;/em&gt;
&amp;larr; because this country is next to oceans, and its counterpart is
those countries on land such as France and Germany. This, is
ridiculous!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;First of all, US territory is HUGE! It's comparable in size with any
of these so called land countries &amp;mdash; China, Russia... In
particular, it's so much greater, I mean, in square miles, than
France …&lt;/p&gt;</description><dc:creator xmlns:dc="http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/">Feng Xia</dc:creator><pubDate>Tue, 02 Jul 2019 11:42:00 -0400</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">tag:fengxia41103.github.io,2019-07-02:/myblog/the wrong elite.html</guid><category>thoughts</category><category>thoughts</category></item><item><title>Another Friday</title><link>https://fengxia41103.github.io/myblog/another%20friday.html</link><description>&lt;figure class="col s12"&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I don't know how to put today. Another Friday, sunny, humid, hot. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is the last day for many who were affected from last round of
layoff. Ran into a couple people I know yesterday and this morning.
Though I barely know any of them personally or through
work. Nonetheless, they are familiar faces, and seeing something,
someone, familiar to disappear from your life must be, and is, sad. I
sat down with them to exchange emails, phone numbers, talked to them
about the hirings our team is looking for, encouraging them to send me
their resume and I will forward them, and can certainly provide more
information regarding these positions and the project if they are
interested in &amp;mdash; I just wish there were something I could do, to
make their life better? or to just soften the blow? am I again
guessing their feelings based on mine, which, on the bright side, is
called sympathy, on the flip side is called arrogant and even
ignorant? I don't know. It's just part of me &amp;mdash; I …&lt;/p&gt;</description><dc:creator xmlns:dc="http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/">Feng Xia</dc:creator><pubDate>Fri, 28 Jun 2019 11:17:00 -0400</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">tag:fengxia41103.github.io,2019-06-28:/myblog/another friday.html</guid><category>thoughts</category><category>love</category></item><item><title>Venezuela</title><link>https://fengxia41103.github.io/myblog/venezuela.html</link><description>&lt;figure class="col l5 m5 s12"&gt;
  &lt;img src="images/miracles.jpg"/&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A country I only know by its name, Venezuela. Yet it's on the NPR news
these days, and the country is going through some terrible times. The
world feels, turbulent, really &amp;mdash; US policy is aggressive that
it's on &lt;em&gt;war&lt;/em&gt; with China, with Iran, with just about everybody, and
there are human disasters, as always, like in this poor Venezuela.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The news mentioned the word, social fabric. This gets me thinking,
more and more these days with a growing age, that the society feels
like a living organ, a living thing, that, like an individual's body,
changes all the time, aging, perhaps, but more accurately, adapting,
constantly, so the word, the form that we know of today, will be so
different 10 years down the road, that some of them even become the
complete opposite! If individual human is already complex, then how
can an aggregation of a lot of them, thus a society, becomes any less
complex? It should only manifest the complexity with more combination
possibilities, therefore more varieties, more alternative path of
execution …&lt;/p&gt;</description><dc:creator xmlns:dc="http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/">Feng Xia</dc:creator><pubDate>Wed, 26 Jun 2019 09:29:00 -0400</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">tag:fengxia41103.github.io,2019-06-26:/myblog/venezuela.html</guid><category>thoughts</category><category>thoughts</category></item><item><title>Dev structure</title><link>https://fengxia41103.github.io/myblog/dev%20structure.html</link><description>&lt;figure class="col l5 m5 s12"&gt;

  &lt;figcaption&gt;If the Bible story happens today&lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is a common question any team/project will have to address
&amp;mdash; how to structure the knowledge we know of a project so that we
are not missing things? Each project/application, of course, is
different. But the overall is actually quite common. Here is a
structure I'm proposing that is applicable not only during initial
learning phase, but can guide the design and development as well.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Take an example that we are building a portal, which has frontend and
backend &amp;mdash; the &lt;code&gt;backend&lt;/code&gt; is showing more levels than the
&lt;code&gt;frontend&lt;/code&gt;, the idea is the same:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="highlight"&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;code&gt;Portal
&lt;span class="w"&gt;  &lt;/span&gt;Frontend
&lt;span class="w"&gt;    &lt;/span&gt;Design
&lt;span class="w"&gt;    &lt;/span&gt;Build/packaging
&lt;span class="w"&gt;    &lt;/span&gt;Dev&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;breakdown&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;incl.&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;unit&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;tests&lt;span class="o"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="w"&gt;    &lt;/span&gt;Tests

&lt;span class="w"&gt;  &lt;/span&gt;Backend
&lt;span class="w"&gt;    &lt;/span&gt;Design
&lt;span class="w"&gt;      &lt;/span&gt;Logical&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nv"&gt;view&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt;&amp;gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nv"&gt;components&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="w"&gt;                   &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt;&amp;gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;key&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;technology&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;stack
&lt;span class="w"&gt;      &lt;/span&gt;Components
&lt;span class="w"&gt;        &lt;/span&gt;REST&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;API

&lt;span class="w"&gt;        &lt;/span&gt;another..


&lt;span class="w"&gt;    &lt;/span&gt;Build/packaging
&lt;span class="w"&gt;      &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="k"&gt;for&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;dev

  &lt;img src="images/temperature.jpg"/&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Once a while I need to make a 2x2 for official document such as
passport. It's annoying if I need to go CVS paying $15 for a digital
while myself owns a whole bunch of lenses and am proud of myself of
taking good photos.. well, I guess this is exaggerated feeling, it's
like saying that doctors shouldn't let other doctors treat them. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ok. So out of curiosity, I have always fallen back to GIMP to make a
4x6, thus 6 of 2x2, and print it for like 27 cents. So much
satisfying! But since I don't do this for a living, it's totally new
each time I need to do this. So, let's write this down once for all,
so I can look it up next time, quickly.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Steps is straightforward:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Pick a photo with not-too-noisy background, because we will select
   using the &lt;a href="https://docs.gimp.org/en/gimp-tool-iscissors.html"&gt;intelligent scissor&lt;/a&gt; in GIMP. So the more contrast or
   clean the person is in this photo, the easier.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This must be a super upsetting day for Noah, after a super good day
for him and me yesterday, that he brought home his EOG report with a 4
for ELA and a 5(!) for Science!! Very cool very cool ~~~&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Then, his beloved sunflower, the only survivor planted in the Spring,
snapped near the root, and is already withering in front of our
eyes. He tried to duck tape them back, but of course that won't
work. I asked him pull the stem in the house so we can take a good
look at it, and later give it a proper bury instead of letting it rot
outside &amp;rarr; so it won't be just another out of sight, out of mind,
event for him. He shed some tears cause he really loved his
sunflower. It was a fine plant, growing already about 5 feet tall now,
and seems going strong.

&lt;p&gt;I like this place, like the smell of roasted coffee beans, like the
fragrance that left in your mouth after a sip, that you will never
find in Starbucks regardless how expansive a flavor you order, like
the hippie-ish feeling of the room and the people, like the bright,
yellow, tin ceiling tiles, like the girls working behind the counter
who always carry an atmosphere of both warmth and an aloofness, a
sense of, cool, a sense of "this is my life style, I do what I do, and
leave me alone", like the girl dyed her hair in this, I don't even
know what color that is, greenish, thing, that can only be categorized
as a poor dye job, yet, it fits this room perfectly well.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Man, after watching the &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.co.jp/%E6%9D%B1%E4%BA%AC%E5%A5%B3%E5%AD%90%E5%9B%B3%E9%91%91%E3%82%B7%E3%83%BC%E3%82%BA%E3%83%B3%EF%BC%91/dp/B01MRVSJ77"&gt;東京女子図鑑&lt;/a&gt;, then the &lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R8BR7KllsfM"&gt;beijing
version&lt;/a&gt;, I can not stand the &lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JCkPNFwjdAk"&gt;shanghai version&lt;/a&gt; at all!!!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What is wrong with these story tellers!!? I mean, really, what is
wrong with you!? Can you, honestly, give some thoughts of what the
original Japanese one is about, and be a better story teller when
translating it to your local version!? Not only the story line is
summarized as an immature girl fresh out of college starts her humble
but ambitious life, then going through fortune and fame, and a dozen
men in between, and there is a marriage, a divorce, and back to her
home town to sigh and reflect, which, to me, is almost like
plagiarism, but the details are full of what I would call the
stereotype of women, and that's just disgusting!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On the 2nd episode of the SH version, let me start with this. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;humble college graduates, and women&lt;/h1&gt;

mentored at, looked upon, like …&lt;/p&gt;</description><dc:creator xmlns:dc="http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/">Feng Xia</dc:creator><pubDate>Thu, 16 May 2019 22:44:00 -0400</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">tag:fengxia41103.github.io,2019-05-16:/myblog/tujian.html</guid><category>thoughts</category><category>thoughts</category></item><item><title>Life like a turtle</title><link>https://fengxia41103.github.io/myblog/life%20like%20a%20turtle.html</link><description>&lt;figure class="col s12"&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Walking back from gym a moment ago, passing the 奈何桥 I was always
joking about with her back then. Nice, cool late Spring day, beautiful
weather, beautiful sunshine, beautiful sky, almost beautiful day. Out
of the glittering sun reflection off the pond, there was this lazy
dark patch floating over there &amp;mdash; a turtle, just enjoying its
time, like I felt.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I was watching it, and immediately the thought came to me, that
probably like everyone else who, if had watched this scene, would have
thought, that if only my life is like this guy, just taking time
floating in this peaceful pond, enjoying the weather, enjoying the
life, how nice would that be!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Then, I realized that, with earphone plugged in, I was also listenning
to Mozart's Minuet in D, that is now the tune that I have played many
many times for Dad in 泰康 in his room, that I found peaceful,
relaxing, and beautiful. But then, the turtle had no such tune &amp;mdash;

&lt;p&gt;We need reflection of technology, of the terms tech talks use to
promote themselves and to dwarf others. I have argued before that the
so called 弯道超车 is ridiculous and outright disgusting. Period. This
implies to take a shortcut to win the race. I understand perfectly
technology and new way of doing things can, and should be, if they are
actually good, disruptive. But like everything else in life, the
majority of all are just mediocre, and even trying-too-hard. The true
good ones are always, I believe, always, organic &amp;mdash; meaning that
the idea comes from rich experience and deep insights, not some
outsider dreams of a new way overnight. My favourate these days is the
news of &lt;code&gt;vpnhub&lt;/code&gt; owned by &lt;code&gt;pornhub&lt;/code&gt; &amp;larr; what a wonderful genius

&lt;p&gt;Noah and I had a curious conversation. While pulling off the highway
towards the Reader's Corner, I asked him to look over the powerball
sign to see how much it is now &amp;mdash; 250 millions. That's a lot of
money. So I teased him again about my condo in Tokyo (or really,
anywhere will be just fine), and said that if he owns the Japan
Airline, as he is thinking, then he must be having more money than
this powerball even.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So we started to talk about moving to Mars, that once the Earth
becomes too crowded, maybe he should get me a condo on Mars, or the
"other side of the Moon", as he put it. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But then, it suddenly occurred to me &amp;mdash; when we talk about
migration to Mars, there is always an implication that you must be
super rich in order to be the first few that can enjoy such
privilege. Isn't it …&lt;/p&gt;</description><dc:creator xmlns:dc="http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/">Feng Xia</dc:creator><pubDate>Sun, 12 May 2019 21:46:00 -0400</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">tag:fengxia41103.github.io,2019-05-12:/myblog/mars.html</guid><category>thoughts</category><category>thoughts</category></item><item><title>Globalization</title><link>https://fengxia41103.github.io/myblog/globalization.html</link><description>&lt;figure class="col l6 m6 s12"&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I have been thinking about the word "globalization" in the last couple
days. I used to use it a lot during my MBA days as if it's a magic
word that fits into any topic, any slides, and made it look instantly
a good one, thus bringing me good score. It was iterated but without
me ever giving it much thought of what it actually means.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What does it mean?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There have been numerous discussions on how China is concerned about
national security when CPU and operating system are not home
made, which I have elaborated in &lt;a href="https://fengxia41103.github.io/myblog/operating systems.html"&gt;another article&lt;/a&gt; that such
feeling is completly off the mark. But this does bring me another
thought, that whether it is even possible, or advisable, for the world
to strive for max efficiency? and if so, what does it mean?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Globalization is always dressed to be an equal of international
collaboration. Examples are always that how components of any product
you can see and live with are now made in so many different countries
here and there, and …&lt;/p&gt;</description><dc:creator xmlns:dc="http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/">Feng Xia</dc:creator><pubDate>Thu, 09 May 2019 09:11:00 -0400</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">tag:fengxia41103.github.io,2019-05-09:/myblog/globalization.html</guid><category>thoughts</category><category>thoughts</category></item><item><title>Emotion</title><link>https://fengxia41103.github.io/myblog/emotion.html</link><description>&lt;figure class="col l7 m7 s12"&gt;

&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I have been listening to this midnight talk show by this &lt;a href="https://www.weibo.com/u/1846267753"&gt;woman/girl&lt;/a&gt;
for the last few weeks on and off, and found it quite fascinating, not
that it's sentimental and discussing the eternal topic of love that is
guaranteed to acquire attention and discussion and audience. I found
it interesting because there are so many of this type of programs out
there, and they all sound the same &amp;mdash; same opening line, same
background music, same speed of speech, and sometimes I even feel they
have the same text(!)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But what's the most fascinating thing is, this woman's opening line, "
嘿，睡了吗?"... first time hearing it, I felt a tiny bit strange,
though it feels pretty typical for program like this, reminds me the
相伴到黎明, a program I liked in college days. But, it daunted on me
what's so strange about this line while doing dinner last night.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This seems to be a question of Yes or No. &lt;strong&gt;But, it can only have one
answer!&lt;/strong&gt; &amp;mdash; if you are asleep …&lt;/p&gt;</description><dc:creator xmlns:dc="http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/">Feng Xia</dc:creator><pubDate>Thu, 02 May 2019 09:13:00 -0400</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">tag:fengxia41103.github.io,2019-05-02:/myblog/emotion.html</guid><category>thoughts</category><category>thoughts</category></item><item><title>Pandoc workflow</title><link>https://fengxia41103.github.io/myblog/pandoc%20workflow.html</link><description>&lt;figure class="col s12"&gt;
  &lt;img src="images/peppa.jpg"/&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://pandoc.org/MANUAL.html"&gt;Pandoc&lt;/a&gt; is awesome. I have been using
it for the last six months now writing a reference architecture
document for work. Here is some tips of how I'm using it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;doc header&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Things that are specific to that document. This, thus, is context
sensitive &amp;mdash; &lt;code&gt;title&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code&gt;subtitle&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code&gt;author&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code&gt;bibliography&lt;/code&gt;,
&lt;code&gt;abstract&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code&gt;keywords&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Example:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="highlight"&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class="nt"&gt;title&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="l l-Scalar l-Scalar-Plain"&gt;Open Cloud  Reference Architecture&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="nt"&gt;subtitle&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="l l-Scalar l-Scalar-Plain"&gt;Version 1.0&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="nt"&gt;author&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="w"&gt;  &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p p-Indicator"&gt;-&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="l l-Scalar l-Scalar-Plain"&gt;Feng Xia&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class="nt"&gt;bibliography&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="l l-Scalar l-Scalar-Plain"&gt;feng.bib&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="nt"&gt;keywords&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p p-Indicator"&gt;[&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nv"&gt;Open Cloud&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p p-Indicator"&gt;]&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="nt"&gt;abstract&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p p-Indicator"&gt;|&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class="w"&gt;  &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="no"&gt;Anything goes here.&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One catch is semicolon in &lt;code&gt;title&lt;/code&gt;! Unbelievably, which I haven't
figured out why, that including a ":" in the title string will mess
up export to PDF. The symptom you will see is that all your
reference in &lt;code&gt;.bib&lt;/code&gt; will not be found!!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;LaTex setting&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A universal setting to latex export. This is additional to the LaTex
template file I use. Supposedly I can set all these in the template
also.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But if I'm using multiple template, this can be looked as the common
settings for all the PDF I write.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here is &lt;a href="/downloads/pandoc/latex.yaml"&gt;current version&lt;/a&gt;. It looks like this:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="highlight"&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class="nn"&gt;---&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="nt"&gt;documentclass&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="l l-Scalar l-Scalar-Plain"&gt;scrreprt&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="nt"&gt;papersize&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="l l-Scalar l-Scalar-Plain"&gt;a4 …&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</description><dc:creator xmlns:dc="http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/">Feng Xia</dc:creator><pubDate>Tue, 30 Apr 2019 09:23:00 -0400</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">tag:fengxia41103.github.io,2019-04-30:/myblog/pandoc workflow.html</guid><category>dev</category><category>dev</category></item><item><title>Plagarism</title><link>https://fengxia41103.github.io/myblog/plagarism.html</link><description>&lt;figure class="col l6 m6 s12"&gt;

&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is a stressful day. What a day! Everything started on the normal
footing, until I looked at emails in the inbox and saw a comment of my
writing being an offender of plagarism &amp;mdash; wow!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Indeed. Wow!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I don't know what else I could say about it. Up to the point that I
have built the exhaustive cross references I have ever known how and
seen in any of the document generated by this company, and I know 99%
of that document was written by me as the sole writer, and if there
were any AI to do an analysis it would have found the &lt;strong&gt;style&lt;/strong&gt; of my
writing as if I were writing this blog &amp;mdash; if you write things,
you know there is a distinct way of wordings every writer bears, like
it or not, like a finger print. And yet, plagarism. Wow.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Actually, that's an easy defense to brush it off. What I'm really
frustrated is the terrible mistake the team has made by not keeping up
their own work and let the …&lt;/p&gt;</description><dc:creator xmlns:dc="http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/">Feng Xia</dc:creator><pubDate>Mon, 29 Apr 2019 21:13:00 -0400</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">tag:fengxia41103.github.io,2019-04-29:/myblog/plagarism.html</guid><category>thoughts</category><category>thoughts</category></item><item><title>Browser proxy</title><link>https://fengxia41103.github.io/myblog/browser%20proxy.html</link><description>&lt;p&gt;This is a common trick. Say we have local machine (A), and a remote
machine (B). If we can SSH from A&amp;rarr;B, we can reroute browser
traffic from A to B, much quicker than X-windows.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;figure class="col l4 m4 s12"&gt;
  &lt;img src="images/browser%20proxy.png"
       class="center img-responsive"&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On A, &lt;code&gt;ssh -vv -ND 8080 root@&amp;lt;B's IP&amp;gt;&lt;/code&gt;, then SSH login.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;code&gt;-N&lt;/code&gt;: Do not execute a remote command.  This is useful for
   just forwarding ports.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;code&gt;-D [bind_address:]port&lt;/code&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Specifies a local “dynamic” application-level port forwarding.  This works by
allocating a socket to listen to port on the local side, optionally bound to
the specified bind_address.  Whenever a connection is made to this port, the
connection is forwarded over the secure channel, and the application protocol
is then used to determine where to connect to from the remote machine.  Cur‐
rently the SOCKS4 and SOCKS5 protocols are supported, and ssh will act as a
SOCKS server.  Only root can forward privileged ports.  Dynamic port forward‐
ings can also be specified in the configuration file.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;IPv6 addresses can be specified by enclosing the address in square brackets.
Only the superuser …&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;</description><dc:creator xmlns:dc="http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/">Feng Xia</dc:creator><pubDate>Tue, 23 Apr 2019 14:45:00 -0400</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">tag:fengxia41103.github.io,2019-04-23:/myblog/browser proxy.html</guid><category>dev</category><category>dev</category></item><item><title>History, choice</title><link>https://fengxia41103.github.io/myblog/history%20choice.html</link><description>&lt;figure class="col l6 m6 s12"&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is a tough one, actually, because the topic is really deep. In
this aftermath of the Nortre Dame fire, the idea of restoring the
damage immediately comes to everybody's mind.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Inevitably, however, there are always, two choices &amp;mdash; to rebuild
it as it was, or to build it as we want them, today? Obviously by
posing them in front of you, you see the merits in both
directions. Yet, as a historical trademark, the lean towards the
former is much stronger than the latter. But this exactly raises a
question that I want to talk about &amp;mdash; history.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I have been reading quite some history books, and in recent days start
to read books written by historian on history. It is really
fascinating, because I have never realized the word history is not as
clear as it seems, at all! We have been taking for granted that
history = old, = the past. But to think about it, if the event has
already past, are we just reconstructing it today? After all, the
writer was not necessarily a …&lt;/p&gt;</description><dc:creator xmlns:dc="http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/">Feng Xia</dc:creator><pubDate>Wed, 17 Apr 2019 11:04:00 -0400</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">tag:fengxia41103.github.io,2019-04-17:/myblog/history choice.html</guid><category>thoughts</category><category>thoughts</category></item><item><title>Music</title><link>https://fengxia41103.github.io/myblog/music.html</link><description>&lt;figure class="col s12"&gt;

&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There is magic in music. There is.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I'm listening to this song, a song I have never heard of, and the
singer I have never heard of. Yet, it makes me so sad, so sad. It's
not the words, not the performance, not the story in a MTV, it's just
the, notes, the music.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What is it in music, that I can always feel so touched!? so
connected!? This is the song she introduced me to. I have never heard
of this till that day, and what a surprise to me. I should have known.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;No words can describe a music. It is, choking, when a song touches
your soul. I think the moment of 2006 when Lei passed away is as fresh
as that day. There was a line in the song that 我们最好的朋友昨天晚上
走了 ... this, is like yanking me out of space, out of time, back to
the day he left. How strange, I was just thinking of him this morning,
wondering …&lt;/p&gt;</description><dc:creator xmlns:dc="http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/">Feng Xia</dc:creator><pubDate>Mon, 15 Apr 2019 15:41:00 -0400</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">tag:fengxia41103.github.io,2019-04-15:/myblog/music.html</guid><category>thoughts</category><category>thoughts</category></item><item><title>Frustration</title><link>https://fengxia41103.github.io/myblog/frustration.html</link><description>&lt;figure class="col l7 m7 s12"&gt;

&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Yes, I'm very much frustrated, last night in particular, that I'm
getting fed up by the bullshift question seeking for decision, while
at the meantime the other party gives little information, and has
pretty much made up mind already of what they wanted to do &amp;mdash; so
hell, why do u ask me for!? Do you want to hear my opinion, or just
want a debate!?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The bottom of all these is a fundamental gap I have been perceiving
all long in many settings, not just work, but in life in general, that
many many many many people (yes, definitely too many) who lack the
sheer capability take a thought one step further in their mind and put
in more consideration by asking themselves what it could be like if I
do this, or not to do this? You would think this is the natural way
everybody thinks, that's how mind works, isn't it, by weighing
options? &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But you will be surprised. I know I am. All the time I start to
question whether I'm the …&lt;/p&gt;</description><dc:creator xmlns:dc="http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/">Feng Xia</dc:creator><pubDate>Fri, 12 Apr 2019 11:20:00 -0400</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">tag:fengxia41103.github.io,2019-04-12:/myblog/frustration.html</guid><category>thoughts</category><category>thoughts</category></item><item><title>Stay connected</title><link>https://fengxia41103.github.io/myblog/stay%20connected.html</link><description>&lt;figure class="col s12"&gt;

&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It is indeed quite a long time, 21 years. A friend of mine reminded me
that, this year has been the 21st year since we knew each other. This
is also the age of the internet chat I would say, because we met each
other online, as an early adopter of these chat applications, ICQ,
which was the mother of all chat applications including the copycat,
the Chinese QQ, and of course, now its sequel, the enormous Wechat. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I don't know how our relationship survived the 21 years, during which
many years we had zero contact, zero news of each other. Then when we
started to talk to each other again last December, that I learned she
was then staying in a village somewhere in the west of China doing
some sort of volunteering work, we didn't feel too strange at all.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But this isn't giving me a formula how to maintain the other
relationships in life to be as long-living as this one. You can easily
say that it takes two in a personal …&lt;/p&gt;</description><dc:creator xmlns:dc="http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/">Feng Xia</dc:creator><pubDate>Sat, 06 Apr 2019 14:11:00 -0400</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">tag:fengxia41103.github.io,2019-04-06:/myblog/stay connected.html</guid><category>thoughts</category><category>thoughts</category></item><item><title>Ten years</title><link>https://fengxia41103.github.io/myblog/ten%20years.html</link><description>&lt;figure class="col s12"&gt;

&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I'm scared. I had an uneasy sleep last night, worrying about a lot of
things. In particular, I worried about time, about myself getting
old. At age 46, it seems absurd that I'm feeling old. Yet, that's how
I'm feeling these days, and it is not going away.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I have long realized that ten years is a long time, a long time that
many many things will happen. Actually it is such a long time that it
changes a person, almost completely &amp;larr; looking back myself ten
years ago, the life I had, the state I was in, the look, the body, the
spirit, the activities, the people around me, the person I cared
for... everything, has changed. How alarming! I remember telling Siqi
of this theory while sitting on a stair in Shenzhen after a day's
walking around &amp;mdash; I felt such a wise person to say that, as if I
figured out a secret of life. To her, this must sound like wisdom,
cause her whole life hasn't been counted much in ten-year marks. But …&lt;/p&gt;</description><dc:creator xmlns:dc="http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/">Feng Xia</dc:creator><pubDate>Sun, 24 Mar 2019 09:27:00 -0400</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">tag:fengxia41103.github.io,2019-03-24:/myblog/ten years.html</guid><category>thoughts</category><category>thoughts</category></item><item><title>Ordinary</title><link>https://fengxia41103.github.io/myblog/ordinary.html</link><description>&lt;figure class="col l7 m7 s12"&gt;

&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Have you had a funny feeling on someday, that something is happening,
to someone, someone that jumps to your mind at the first thought when
you had that feeling? That's how I felt today. I don't know what it
is. If looking at this line I just wrote, I would have criticized that
this is complete pointless statement because it is always, true
&amp;mdash; yes, something is always happening, to someone, and yes there
might be one who jumps to your mind, but then, isn't it just
coincidence!? I would say so.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But, but, this is, somehow, different. It is a feeling of someone,
that, someone, that you know you care about, you worry about, you
think of, and you want to know, to find out, to hear from, to be next
to. That the thought that something is happening to him/her makes you,
uneasy. Maybe it's just being selfish, but maybe, it's just that, you
care.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I do. I care, even though it's as remote as I care about a star
traveling too fast …&lt;/p&gt;</description><dc:creator xmlns:dc="http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/">Feng Xia</dc:creator><pubDate>Fri, 22 Mar 2019 10:54:00 -0400</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">tag:fengxia41103.github.io,2019-03-22:/myblog/ordinary.html</guid><category>thoughts</category><category>love</category></item><item><title>City life</title><link>https://fengxia41103.github.io/myblog/city%20life.html</link><description>&lt;figure class="col s12"&gt;

&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I find it curious. Listening to a sentimental talk show on the Netease
music app, the kind that a young woman's pretty face as the icon, and
a soothing voice that suggest the picture you see is her, and slow,
relaxing, late night style light music in the background, and always
topics of thoughts, quite like what I have from time to time, about
life, about love, about career, about purpose, about why the suffering
and why the choice.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On the one hand, I feel she is too young to be really understand the
depth of these topics. I can't help having the sense that this is 为说
新词强说愁, and many of the arguments are actually, false, in my
opinion, because there is an underline assumption that she is not even
touching (or making it obvious that she is aware of such
assumption). For example, a popular sentiment is the anxiety of young
people who is living a city life &amp;mdash; so called stress from work,
from struggling, especially if struggling …&lt;/p&gt;</description><dc:creator xmlns:dc="http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/">Feng Xia</dc:creator><pubDate>Wed, 20 Mar 2019 21:29:00 -0400</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">tag:fengxia41103.github.io,2019-03-20:/myblog/city life.html</guid><category>thoughts</category><category>thoughts</category></item><item><title>What is your song</title><link>https://fengxia41103.github.io/myblog/what%20is%20your%20song.html</link><description>&lt;iframe width="100%" height="700"

&lt;p&gt;Have you ever felt, that someday, there is a song, that makes you
think of, someone? And this song, always, always, reminds of, of that
person, regardless how remote and how far it has been. Somehow, this
person, is tied to this tune, to a scene in your head, in your memory,
that you can still recall the moment you first heard it, as if the
first time you met him/her, the first time you went out, the first
time you had fun at park, playing arcade, watching a video, sharing a
dessert, drinking coffee, window shopping, or just wondering around in
the city, by the suburb, along an unknown road that led to somewhere,
but neither of you cared, because it was the moment being next to each
other mattered, and you could go anywhere with him/her, however where
the road is going to lead.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Isn't it love? or just a 心动? or it's the beginning of a love, that
is always beautiful, touching, making your soul nervous, tremble even,

&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;How curious! Human, I do mean the general population whom I observe in
various settings, always get excited by a thing, a place, another
person, that has practically speaking &lt;strong&gt;nothing to do with him/her&lt;/strong&gt;,
but yet, they are so eager to make a connection with that thing, that
place, that person, that they even feel proud!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You bet. Any idol groups can testify this &amp;mdash; you idol has
developed a skill, whether it's dance, or look, or scandal, or talent,
or hoax, is really, his/her doing. But when you are labeling ourself
that "yes I love you! I'm your no. #1 fan!", well, what does it give
you anything, I mean, anything, in reality, but a virtual link that
you know this person (sure, and love this person), but the harsh
reality is, this person, your idol, do not know you, and whatever s/he
has developed, was probably caused by you (or people like you), but do
not belong to you, nor will give it you.

ads’ in 2018, down 28% from 2017". I'm thinking the sheer number and
complexity involves to make detection, and to take action against
these 2.3 billion bad Ads. This is an absolute tech challenge, not to
mention the principle that drives such intention, and the
willingness to put down something like this to cleanse oneself.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I know Google has always had the &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Don%27t_be_evil"&gt;Don't be evil&lt;/a&gt; motto, which I
found quite impressive when first heard of it. This is hard. I mean,
this is an ambiguous term &amp;mdash; what is evil? who be the judge? and
what should you do about it? Google's number revenue is still its Ads,
and yet this 2.3B bad ads are not just noises, but toxics that will
pollute the market, and thus killing its cash source. So you could
argue that Google has every incentive to take this action.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But this faces the exact same question raised &amp;mdash; who determines
good or bad? and if we take it into the …&lt;/p&gt;</description><dc:creator xmlns:dc="http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/">Feng Xia</dc:creator><pubDate>Thu, 14 Mar 2019 13:29:00 -0400</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">tag:fengxia41103.github.io,2019-03-14:/myblog/self-disciplined.html</guid><category>thoughts</category><category>thoughts</category></item><item><title>Self-esteem</title><link>https://fengxia41103.github.io/myblog/self-esteem.html</link><description>&lt;figure class="col l6 m6 s12"&gt;

&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I start to understand now, better perhaps, than before, that what
self-esteem feels like, and why women have this anxiety of so.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;With aging I start to notice that hair is becoming less, and this has
been bothering me for the last few weeks when I started to notice
it. Not that I'm going bald or anything, just that comparing to what I
had, it feels, less.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Then, all of sudden, I start to realize this is exactly how women feel
all along in their life, that they want to lose weight, they want to
look young! I have always laughed at such attempt, calling it a &lt;strong&gt;lost
battle&lt;/strong&gt; because there is really no point of trying so, for that first
of all it doesn't really change who they are, no man is going to love
or not love you just because you have a few extra pounds. Actually,
most of them who are bothered by their "weight" look just fine,
really, in my eyes at least, there is not obesity or anything even
close …&lt;/p&gt;</description><dc:creator xmlns:dc="http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/">Feng Xia</dc:creator><pubDate>Thu, 07 Mar 2019 09:00:00 -0500</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">tag:fengxia41103.github.io,2019-03-07:/myblog/self-esteem.html</guid><category>thoughts</category><category>thoughts</category></item><item><title>Rain rain rain</title><link>https://fengxia41103.github.io/myblog/rain%20rain%20rain.html</link><description>&lt;figure class="col s12"&gt;
  &lt;img src="images/our%20love%20story.jpg"/&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Rain, rain, rain. Not quite actually. It's cloudy, misty, and is about
to rain. Nothing really special for an early Spring day. Some flowers
have bloomed, and some are on their way.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Like walking in this mist, reminds me the days I was wondering around
in Suzhou, the college spring break when I was still young. Hard to
believe it is the 25th anniversary since graduation! My god, 25 years,
what have I done!? It is such a long time, yet, I feel I have achieve
little, changed much, and what I have is as little as what I had.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I start to understand why parents will feel their children being the
only, or the most proud of, accomplishment they have in their life
&amp;mdash; I probably will feel so, too, because the child is the only
thing you must stick around, can't easily call a quit (well, for a
responsible parent of course), so once you persist it for like 10 or
20 years, looking back, you can't help feeling proud of yourself,
feeling that …&lt;/p&gt;</description><dc:creator xmlns:dc="http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/">Feng Xia</dc:creator><pubDate>Fri, 01 Mar 2019 11:03:00 -0500</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">tag:fengxia41103.github.io,2019-03-01:/myblog/rain rain rain.html</guid><category>thoughts</category><category>love</category></item><item><title>What is engineering</title><link>https://fengxia41103.github.io/myblog/what%20is%20engineering.html</link><description>&lt;figure class="col l6 m6 s12"&gt;
  &lt;img src="images/raise%20a%20bug.png"/&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I have been thinking, and probably being pissed off at the current
status of the work, that whether the concept of engineering in my mind
is the problem, or what I perceive is correct and it's the others who
are not getting it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So, what is engineering? I recall back in high school when we were to
enter the application for college. Being a naive spoiled kid back
then, I had no idea what I wanted to do, nor what myself is or can be
good at. I remember my dad told me that after meeting with my teacher
班主任, the guy felt I could be good at engineering. "What a nonsense!"
I thought. I had no idea what engineering requires, had little
interest in engineering (though my parents both were engineers), and
certainly didn't think myself fit that profile at all &amp;mdash; Noah's
absent-mindness everyday constantly reminds me what I was like back
then. So if anything, I was as far from being a good engineer as an
engineer could possibly be.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But …&lt;/p&gt;</description><dc:creator xmlns:dc="http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/">Feng Xia</dc:creator><pubDate>Thu, 21 Feb 2019 10:22:00 -0500</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">tag:fengxia41103.github.io,2019-02-21:/myblog/what is engineering.html</guid><category>thoughts</category><category>thoughts</category></item><item><title>Strange fate</title><link>https://fengxia41103.github.io/myblog/strange%20fate.html</link><description>&lt;figure class="col s12"&gt;
    &lt;img src="images/country%20life.jpg"/&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Have you had this feeling before? that something is off, and things
are happening in a strange way?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is how I felt yesterday and the day before. Went to see a medical
surgeon to take care of that bump on the back of my head. At parking
lot, out of the twenty some years of driving a car, I ended up
stepping forward and ran over a curb, and of the entire way back home,
I felt my mind was just somewhere. I didn't know what was happening,
just that strange feeling that my mind was off, off. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Then at night at the end of scrum, Eric asked me whether I have seen
his email. So I found this email, that came from some BS email
address:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="highlight"&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;KANDULA&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;VENKATA&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;NARENDRA&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;REDDY&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;bugbounty10378&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nv"&gt;@gmail&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;com&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;and it has caused an &lt;strong&gt;uproar&lt;/strong&gt; inside the company that some 
trade secret has been leaked by rouge developer and such, myself
included (well, technically yes, but then, the internal analysis said
that I'm no longer working here... so much …&lt;/p&gt;</description><dc:creator xmlns:dc="http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/">Feng Xia</dc:creator><pubDate>Fri, 15 Feb 2019 11:08:00 -0500</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">tag:fengxia41103.github.io,2019-02-15:/myblog/strange fate.html</guid><category>thoughts</category><category>thoughts</category></item><item><title>Tears</title><link>https://fengxia41103.github.io/myblog/tears.html</link><description>&lt;figure class="col s12"&gt;
  &lt;img src="images/catching%20star.jpg"/&gt;
  &lt;figcaption&gt;Caught a full bag of stars. Last time I had this moment
  was in 2004 just before I was leaving for Beijing. Fourteen years later,
  there they are again, glittering, haven't changed.&lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There must be an interlink between humans. I can't believe that a
movie like &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fahrenheit_11/9"&gt;Fahrenheit 11/9&lt;/a&gt; would have made me to stop in the
middle because, watching people cry is so, tough.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I don't know. Does everybody feel this way, I wonder? I'm sure they
do. We know movies are touching, so are some entertainment shows, that
having somebody cry always make the audiences, weep, and freeze, and
make the moment memorable. So this must be universal. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What about in real life? I have seen people cry, someone close to me,
some just strangers passing by, but why I feel more touched when
watching them on screen instead of seeing them live? Is it the music?
the story line? the close-up view angle that you don't get to see in
reality? the moment of a sudden silence when movie maker removed all …&lt;/p&gt;</description><dc:creator xmlns:dc="http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/">Feng Xia</dc:creator><pubDate>Sun, 03 Feb 2019 10:30:00 -0500</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">tag:fengxia41103.github.io,2019-02-03:/myblog/tears.html</guid><category>thoughts</category><category>thoughts</category></item><item><title>Forget someone</title><link>https://fengxia41103.github.io/myblog/forget%20someone.html</link><description>&lt;figure class="col s12"&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Forget someone, is hard.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Your image kept popping into my head this morning, on treadmill, on a
path walked from building to building, in the sun, by the shadow of a
tree, in the cold winter air, or warmth of a ray that brings one of
billion-th of energy for the universe all the way to my body, a branch
without leaves but is secretly preparing to welcome the inevitable
Spring, a bird flying by, some geese who have started migrating north,
or my cats who snuggle by my side last night while I was having a late
night call, and getting up with me when he thought I was going to
reahch out more midnight snack for him....&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You are, everywhere, will not pass, will not forget.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Why is it so? Looking back, I hardly have forgotten anyone w/ whom I
have devoted time and love to, from the first girl I met, to you. I
wonder whether this is just me, or this is human nature that everyone
is capable of, but someone …&lt;/p&gt;</description><dc:creator xmlns:dc="http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/">Feng Xia</dc:creator><pubDate>Wed, 30 Jan 2019 12:34:00 -0500</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">tag:fengxia41103.github.io,2019-01-30:/myblog/forget someone.html</guid><category>thoughts</category><category>love</category></item><item><title>Time</title><link>https://fengxia41103.github.io/myblog/time.html</link><description>&lt;figure class="col l6 m6 s12"&gt;
  &lt;img src="images/reddit%20cat%20portrait.jpg"/&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Time is indeed relative. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I was talking to Noah about this this morning &amp;mdash; why one feels
the time in the morning always flies by?  Theoretically time is
uniform, it ticks by the second all the time, at the same pace. It
doesn't change over the course of a day, so why morning time feels
short? Well, we are not talking about bad days that you felt like
indefinite long, but just a regular Wednesday morning.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So here is my theory: &lt;strong&gt;I think time feels different because your
brain is operating at a different speed&lt;/strong&gt; &amp;rarr; in the morning, your
brain is slow to boot up, thus the constant flow of time feels a speed
train passing you by, again, this is arguably the &lt;em&gt;perception&lt;/em&gt; of time
by your brain (exactly). On the flip side, time will then feel short
when your brain is working at a higher speed. The experience will be
when you are in the zone of writing code or doing something, that you
&lt;em&gt;forgot about time&lt;/em&gt; and felt it was really short!

&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;U want know some bizzare logic? Here is one, from a terrible
ridiculous argument w/ Noah's mom.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;She said at dinner table that she has applied two charter schools for
Noah. I then asked what are these two schools, and want to know more
about them. We talked about Noah's middle school assignment, and she
was mentioning that charter school could be an option. I was rather
glad that she took an initiative, unlike before she wouldn't do
anything but to ask me to make a decision.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;However, this conversation derailed to the point that it was becoming
really bizzare. So she started telling me how bad west carry, the one
that Noah got assigned to go this year. So I said this is not what I'm
asking; I'm asking to know more about these two schools. Then she
started to say that I asked in such a challenging tone, that in the
end the conclusion was that I didn't respect her. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Why so? Because, according to her, I didn't listen and didn't try to …&lt;/p&gt;</description><dc:creator xmlns:dc="http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/">Feng Xia</dc:creator><pubDate>Fri, 25 Jan 2019 20:00:00 -0500</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">tag:fengxia41103.github.io,2019-01-25:/myblog/bizzare logic.html</guid><category>thoughts</category><category>thoughts</category></item><item><title>human and perception</title><link>https://fengxia41103.github.io/myblog/human%20and%20perception.html</link><description>&lt;figure class="col l6 m6 s12"&gt;
  &lt;img src="images/anxiety.jpg"/&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I'm finding myself battling my own perception these days, a
lot. Perception isn't a new topic to me. I have analyzed in &lt;a href="https://fengxia41103.github.io/myblog/hurt feelings.html"&gt;hurt
feeling&lt;/a&gt; whether it is a reasonable action for Noah's mom to feel
hurt because of something I did, well, at least based on her
claim. But still, perception is such a fundamental thing of human,
that in this trip w/ Noah, and in the last few days when he and I were
both recovering from jetlag, this is the only thing I could think of
to reason how I had lost patience w/ him, and started to dislike more
and more of myself &amp;rarr; perception, is the evil cause of all human
unhappiness.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Cambodia, and the image of that place, was constantly on my mind this
morning. Watched two documentaries yesterday &amp;mdash; &lt;a href="http://www.savemyseoul.com/"&gt;save my
seoul&lt;/a&gt;, and one that talks about child trafficking in Siem Reap,
the city Noah and I just visited. And this morning Noah and I were
watching this really strange, and rather too realistic japanese movie
called &lt;em&gt;Happy Hour&lt;/em&gt;, in which …&lt;/p&gt;</description><dc:creator xmlns:dc="http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/">Feng Xia</dc:creator><pubDate>Tue, 22 Jan 2019 10:30:00 -0500</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">tag:fengxia41103.github.io,2019-01-22:/myblog/human and perception.html</guid><category>thoughts</category><category>thoughts</category></item><item><title>Taikang 2019</title><link>https://fengxia41103.github.io/myblog/taikang%202019.html</link><description>&lt;figure class="col s12"&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Dear friends of the 19th floor,&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At time of departing, there is always something come to mind that I
feel to speak and to write. So here it is. Take it as a "Thank you"
note, or just a plain letter, from someone who had the privilege live
with this crew for a few weeks, being able to see and hear what your
day is like, and want you to know how wonderful you really are.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you have ever in doubt of your job and the life you are giving to
these patients in your nursing, I hope you will find my letter
comforting, and encouraging. Not that I want to pump you up by
persuading how important your job is; but by pointing out a fact that
each time when I visited, including this time, that I noticed the mark
this work has left on you &amp;mdash; a small wrinkle, a gray hair, a look
from lacking sleep, a body that speaks "I'm tired" yet you keep giving
to these people as if this …&lt;/p&gt;</description><dc:creator xmlns:dc="http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/">Feng Xia</dc:creator><pubDate>Mon, 14 Jan 2019 15:00:00 -0500</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">tag:fengxia41103.github.io,2019-01-14:/myblog/taikang 2019.html</guid><category>thoughts</category><category>thoughts</category></item><item><title>Operating systems</title><link>https://fengxia41103.github.io/myblog/operating%20systems.html</link><description>&lt;figure class="col l8 m8 s12"&gt;
  &lt;img src="images/funny/dilbert%20software.jpg"/&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Let me talk about OS. This has been an annoying topic recently due to
the ZTE fiasco, which to me is a running joke on its own &amp;mdash; &lt;a href="https://money.cnn.com/2018/06/22/news/companies/zte-us-fine-trade-case/index.html"&gt;one
billion dollar fine&lt;/a&gt;, and we got nothing but a bunch of BS articles
circulating on in wechat that arouses nationalistic sentiments with
conspiracy theory, but nothing else.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The common focus point of these arguments are two things &amp;mdash; OS,
and CPU. When they talk about CPU, as if there is only one maker
called Intel, and if only China could have developed its own CPU, the
threat is over. Well, this is a totally ignorant assumption because,
first of all, Intel is just one of many CPU manufacturers, where is
AMD, where is GPU, do they even know what type of workloads are now
running on what hardware? There are army of these chips, each designed
for its specific purpose. The CPU you can buy at Micro Center is but a
tiny tip of an iceberg, it's a general purpose at best, and even this
I would suspect …&lt;/p&gt;</description><dc:creator xmlns:dc="http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/">Feng Xia</dc:creator><pubDate>Sun, 13 Jan 2019 08:35:00 -0500</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">tag:fengxia41103.github.io,2019-01-13:/myblog/operating systems.html</guid><category>thoughts</category><category>thoughts</category></item><item><title>Details</title><link>https://fengxia41103.github.io/myblog/details.html</link><description>&lt;figure class="col s12"&gt;

&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Devils are indeed in details. Watching a Japanese movie &lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I0wv79C0zqc"&gt;Fire on the
Plain&lt;/a&gt;, it suddenly reminded me a topic I have always wanted to
write about &amp;mdash; you know, when we are listening to the wonderful
story of the Three Kingdoms, and fancy how powerful China was, and how
you could also be a hero, neither the author, nor anyone has lived off
these stories, such as nowadays talk show hosts, bother to mention to
you at all, that if there were indeed an army of that size &amp;mdash; a
few hundred thousands, or even millions, how terrible the smell their
camp must have been!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yes. We heard in 评书 of 埋锅造饭, and there are many stories about
how an army can run out of food, and how you can raid your enemy's
food line to arouse a panic. But, no one has described the other end
of the human digest system &amp;mdash; shits! Literally. If you eat, you
shit. They have to come out, somehow, some way, some day. No
exception. As a …&lt;/p&gt;</description><dc:creator xmlns:dc="http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/">Feng Xia</dc:creator><pubDate>Fri, 11 Jan 2019 15:45:00 -0500</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">tag:fengxia41103.github.io,2019-01-11:/myblog/details.html</guid><category>thoughts</category><category>thoughts</category></item><item><title>Thank me</title><link>https://fengxia41103.github.io/myblog/thank%20me.html</link><description>&lt;p&gt;This is a curious thing. Maybe I'm thinking too much again. So at the
dinner table, two women sitting next to me asked me to open a jar for
her. Sure thing, The there is a girl sitting across to us on another
table said, "turn it upside down and hit bottom a couple times." Well,
I tried first to open it without doing anything, it didn't open. So I
know exactly what it will take, just hit the lid on table edge
slightly, and after that, since the girl was saying so, I turned it
upside down, hit bottom a couple times, and after a few seconds of
struggle, the lid came off. The woman who requested this job said,
"还是小姑娘利害"... errr...&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;credit&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This gets me thinking, why? why people care about credits? why such a
comment will make me think more than once? is that because it bothers
me? but then, I couldn't care less what she said in return, or whether
credits go to the young …&lt;/p&gt;</description><dc:creator xmlns:dc="http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/">Feng Xia</dc:creator><pubDate>Wed, 09 Jan 2019 18:55:00 -0500</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">tag:fengxia41103.github.io,2019-01-09:/myblog/thank me.html</guid><category>thoughts</category><category>thoughts</category></item><item><title>Wife material</title><link>https://fengxia41103.github.io/myblog/wife%20material.html</link><description>&lt;figure class="col l8 m8 s12"&gt;

&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Traveling reveals one thing to me. I don't know whether this is unique
to me, or it is common to many people, guys especially. I start to
realize that, regardless which space I am in, let's say, in a shuttle
bus, or a subway, or an airport, or a country like Cambodia, there are
always women, and among them, somehow, there is always one that you
will find attractive, like to look at a few more times. It's a
pleasant feeling, but also feels strange in a social context, that
feels like a pervert. But honestly, it just happens. I step into this
space, observe, start to be aware of people around me, then violla,
over there, there is this one person that you will just realize, that
she is good looking (in sense of relativity of course), and you want
to see more of her.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;How interesting! I start to see this pattern over and over and over
again. Even while touring some random tourist site, there is always
someone that catches my eyes …&lt;/p&gt;</description><dc:creator xmlns:dc="http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/">Feng Xia</dc:creator><pubDate>Mon, 07 Jan 2019 09:22:00 -0500</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">tag:fengxia41103.github.io,2019-01-07:/myblog/wife material.html</guid><category>thoughts</category><category>thoughts</category></item><item><title>Watching cloud</title><link>https://fengxia41103.github.io/myblog/watching%20clouds.html</link><description>&lt;figure class="col l6 m6 s12"&gt;
  &lt;img src="images/korea%20addidas.png"/&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When was the last time I watched clouds floating by? when was the last
time you watched clouds floating by?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I can't recall it anymore. It felt like a strange memory. Do you know
when you are staring at clouds, you feel it is moving towards you,
becoming larger and larger, and some part of it is always moving,
changing, like 棉絮, how fascinating!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Last night's street food definitely had a toll on both of us. Swimming
a bit helped, but I could still feel the cranking at stomach, and Noah
is taking a nap next by the pool. These traveling young couple decided
to have lunch at the hotel's restaurant. I could smell the perfume
the girl is wearing. Beautiful weather, a bit hot, but beautiful. I
don't think we can ask more from nature for a better life. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Noah had a sharp observation the other day, that there is no cars
honking! Yes indeed. The whole city, regardless the zillion bikes,
scooters, motorcycles, kids on every kind on every kind of these …&lt;/p&gt;</description><dc:creator xmlns:dc="http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/">Feng Xia</dc:creator><pubDate>Sat, 05 Jan 2019 13:12:00 -0500</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">tag:fengxia41103.github.io,2019-01-05:/myblog/watching clouds.html</guid><category>thoughts</category><category>love</category></item><item><title>Turning a cycle</title><link>https://fengxia41103.github.io/myblog/turning%20a%20cycle.html</link><description>&lt;figure class="col s12"&gt;

&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Life is turning a cycle. Landed in Siem Reap w/ Noah last
night. Immigration was at snail speed, reminded me what I have already
forgotten &amp;mdash; perhaps it was just as slow, but w/ her, time flew
by. There were a young Japanese couple on the shuttle bus going from
terminal to the airplane. What a love in the air! How wonderful to see
couples in love, however their lives may play out to be. They are
just, wonderfully, happy. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The country has not changed, and it has changed much. Watching
scooters and motorcycles going by this morning while Noah and I were
sitting at the hotel's breakfast place enjoyin g fancy meal, I think
the people are dressing better, the vehicles look better, and young
staffs are having a fancier hairdo and accessories than I
remembered. I hope this country will do well. It is such a beautiful
place, with such a lovely people, how can they be forgotten so they
must suffer? It's unfair, and I hope there will be their turn.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Everywhere I …&lt;/p&gt;</description><dc:creator xmlns:dc="http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/">Feng Xia</dc:creator><pubDate>Wed, 02 Jan 2019 09:25:00 -0500</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">tag:fengxia41103.github.io,2019-01-02:/myblog/turning a cycle.html</guid><category>thoughts</category><category>love</category></item><item><title>2018</title><link>https://fengxia41103.github.io/myblog/2018.html</link><description>&lt;figure class="col s12"&gt;

&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Last day of 2018. Snowed yesterday. Amazingly the snow accumulated
over night, and Shanghai is now looking pretty, covered in white, and
fresh air. Listening to Xmas music in Starbucks, with Noah reading his
comic book next to me. It's quiet. The shop just opened. I thought it
was already opened at 7, but it turned out we were the first
customers. I like it, peaceful and quiet, and holiday in the air. Sent
you a message on the way over. I saw the snow, and that is forever
linked with you. I can see your face brighten up and your prettiness
is captured in someone's camera. Yes, this is what you will like, and
I am happy to imagine how happy you will be.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What more can I ask about life, when I have this type of rather luxury
life, where the person I love, Noah, is next to me, and I am able to
spend some time w/ Dad? Though I don't know …&lt;/p&gt;</description><dc:creator xmlns:dc="http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/">Feng Xia</dc:creator><pubDate>Mon, 31 Dec 2018 08:22:00 -0500</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">tag:fengxia41103.github.io,2018-12-31:/myblog/2018.html</guid><category>thoughts</category><category>thoughts</category></item><item><title>City</title><link>https://fengxia41103.github.io/myblog/city.html</link><description>&lt;figure class="col s12"&gt;
  &lt;img src="images/her.jpg"/&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;What makes a city? what makes a &lt;strong&gt;good city&lt;/strong&gt;? I wonder.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I start to have a mixed feeling of Shanghai, from love, to dislike, to
annoyed, to now feeling, maybe, I could live here, someday. It is,
tolerable, in a sense that, it is so massive and dynamic, and there is
gotta be a corner for me, and a person for me, just that I need keep
an open mind to it. What made me think this way isn't something of
Shanghai, but I was thinking to live in &lt;a href="https://fengxia41103.github.io/myblog/people watching.html"&gt;Seoul&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But then, it is just another mega metropolitan, another million people
that I do not know, and I had impression of a happy tourist, and a
hope of an opportunist just like a kid wondering into a new candy
shop, a new theme park &amp;mdash; everything is new, everything is
exciting, everything seems possible &amp;larr; even when I am typing this,
the underline assumption is that, everything &lt;strong&gt;good&lt;/strong&gt; is possible! I
wasn't thinking at all that by using the word "everything", well, by
definition, it includes both …&lt;/p&gt;</description><dc:creator xmlns:dc="http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/">Feng Xia</dc:creator><pubDate>Thu, 20 Dec 2018 07:55:00 -0500</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">tag:fengxia41103.github.io,2018-12-20:/myblog/city.html</guid><category>thoughts</category><category>love</category></item><item><title>Mobs</title><link>https://fengxia41103.github.io/myblog/mobs.html</link><description>&lt;figure class="col s12"&gt;

&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The news of Ofo is really a good one. I wonder when human (well, human
is really a big word, because this is generalizing to all the walking
lives on this planent, so I should really refine this statement to,
well, people? mass?..) will learn. Really, let's use the word,
&lt;strong&gt;they&lt;/strong&gt;, will learn!?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is a demonstration of the old, repeated, disaster, for both
sides &amp;mdash; as consumers, the mass, when they would learn not to
take what these elites say for granted!? when can they think for
themselves whether the thing in fad is really, a good thing? I have to
again repeat the discussion I had with family and friends 2 years
ago, when Ofo and its cousins were the darling of the media, and
everyone was essentially saying that if you don't understand and not
yet be part of this wave of &lt;a href="https://fengxia41103.github.io/myblog/sharing economy.html"&gt;sharing economy&lt;/a&gt;, you are out, old,
obsolete. I questioned many why they think this was a good thing, and
honestly no one was able to explain to me in their own …&lt;/p&gt;</description><dc:creator xmlns:dc="http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/">Feng Xia</dc:creator><pubDate>Wed, 19 Dec 2018 07:55:00 -0500</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">tag:fengxia41103.github.io,2018-12-19:/myblog/mobs.html</guid><category>thoughts</category><category>thoughts</category></item><item><title>Human intelligence</title><link>https://fengxia41103.github.io/myblog/human%20intellignece.html</link><description>&lt;figure class="col l8 m8 s12 right"&gt;

&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;What in incredible &lt;a href="http://dougengelbart.org/content/view/138/000/"&gt;paper&lt;/a&gt;! This says so much computer and
artificial intelligence than any of the popular talks. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Every process of thought or action is made up of sub-processes. Let us
consider such examples as making a pencil stroke, writing a letter of
the alphabet, or making a plan. Quite a few discrete muscle movements
are organized into the making of a pencil stroke; similarly, making
particular pencil strokes and making a plan for a letter are complex
processes in themselves that become sub-processes to the over-all
writing of an alphabetic character.  2a8&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Although every sub-process is a process in its own right, in that it
consists of further sub-processes, there seems to be no point here in
looking for the ultimate bottom of the process-hierarchical
structure. There seems to be no way of telling whether or not the
apparent bottoms (processes that cannot be further subdivided) exist
in the physical world or in the limitations of human understanding.
2a9&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In any case, it is not necessary to begin from the bottom in
discussing particular …&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;</description><dc:creator xmlns:dc="http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/">Feng Xia</dc:creator><pubDate>Thu, 13 Dec 2018 19:19:00 -0500</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">tag:fengxia41103.github.io,2018-12-13:/myblog/human intellignece.html</guid><category>thoughts</category><category>thoughts</category></item><item><title>People watching</title><link>https://fengxia41103.github.io/myblog/people%20watching.html</link><description>&lt;figure class="col s12"&gt;
  &lt;img src="images/seoul.jpg"/&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Traveling is indeed relaxing. I think I know why &amp;rarr; first of all,
you don't have the daily chore to deal with, no daily routine, no
daily worries, no family, no kids, no work. Second, in a new place, it
always spells opportunity, unknown, as if everything is now possible
&amp;rarr; new encounter, new face, new soul mate just around the corner.
People don't know you, you don't know them. Somehow, they all look,
nice, kind, smiling at you. Especially when you are in a new country,
new language feels so exotic, you don't know what they are saying, but
they all sound really, cute, don't they!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Then, there is, people watching. How fascinating! The thing I like to
do the most on a trip is, people watching. Just like now, sitting by a
bay this beautiful window by a sidewalk in Seoul, snowing a bit this
morning that streets are covered by a layer of snow dusts, then,
watching office people walking by to their destination, all dressed
up, all look serious, all still in their …&lt;/p&gt;</description><dc:creator xmlns:dc="http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/">Feng Xia</dc:creator><pubDate>Thu, 13 Dec 2018 08:40:00 -0500</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">tag:fengxia41103.github.io,2018-12-13:/myblog/people watching.html</guid><category>thoughts</category><category>love</category></item><item><title>A love story</title><link>https://fengxia41103.github.io/myblog/a%20love%20story.html</link><description>&lt;figure class="col l5 m5 s12"&gt;
  &lt;img src="images/romance%20in%20tibet.jpg"/&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It is quite an  unexpected book.... wow, while looking up its book
name, it turned out that it is actually called &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/Romance-Tibet-Chinese-Chen-QuZhen/dp/7223011173"&gt;A Romance in
Tibet&lt;/a&gt;, wow! I was making up this blog's name without knowing the
books is called a romance... what a coincidence!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But indeed, this is a romance, and quite a sad book. When the
airbnb host recommended it to me, I was like, ok, sure I'll read it,
but well, maybe. The first few pages were actually quite not getting
it. But that's how it turned out, that getting up 3 in the morning due
to jetlag, I got nothing else to read but this book, and what a sad
story it turned out.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You know, these days somehow I do feel there is something like a fate,
like an invisible hand that is guiding my readings. I came up with
these random books here and there, and for some reason their contents
will converge, will echo during the days I was living, and made me
wonder whether they were all put …&lt;/p&gt;</description><dc:creator xmlns:dc="http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/">Feng Xia</dc:creator><pubDate>Thu, 06 Dec 2018 18:54:00 -0500</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">tag:fengxia41103.github.io,2018-12-06:/myblog/a love story.html</guid><category>thoughts</category><category>thoughts</category></item><item><title>Fate</title><link>https://fengxia41103.github.io/myblog/fate.html</link><description>&lt;figure class="col s12"&gt;

&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Another raining winter day. Walking out from airbnb, ran into an old
man carrying a garbage bag, a rain coat with a big cut open on the
back. What caught my attention was his black sneakers &amp;mdash; washed
clean by the rain, but felt soaking wet. He was walking with is right
arm swaying in a strange way while his left hand carrying that

&lt;p&gt;Walking by him, I put umbrella over him, "您好, 我给您打点儿伞吧" "不
用不用" so he answered. But I put umbrella over him and he didn't
resist. "我听您口音也是这边儿的人那" "我大学毕业就留在这儿了...."
didn't catch the rest of his words, then he went across to the other
side of the residence area, I guess it's his job then to keep the area
clean. I watched him went across, but feeling really sad.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So he graduated from college.

&lt;p&gt;Walking on the road this morning. Chilly early winter day. Rained for
the last two days (or really just on and off of yesterday), and
temperature has dropped to the point that I feel the winter smell.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What makes you sad? and makes you wonder? what makes you to have
thoughts? to feel like writing something? to miss someone? to talk to,
if, anyone? to look at the passing bys, taking interest of what they,
where they are going, or what their life is like?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I don't know. This is indeed a strange city. Maybe taking a walk in
the morning does give you more to think about, to feel about, and to
have something to talk about. Sitting here at Starbucks early morning,
while everybody rushes in and out to get their dose, and xmas song in
the background, should I feel tied to home, where they are looking
forward to the upcoming holiday? But I can't feel that at all. This
empty table, like this empty space, is only giving a replay of …&lt;/p&gt;</description><dc:creator xmlns:dc="http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/">Feng Xia</dc:creator><pubDate>Wed, 05 Dec 2018 08:30:00 -0500</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">tag:fengxia41103.github.io,2018-12-05:/myblog/memory.html</guid><category>thoughts</category><category>love</category></item><item><title>Missing you in this city</title><link>https://fengxia41103.github.io/myblog/missing%20you%20in%20this%20city.html</link><description>&lt;figure class="col l8 m8 s12"&gt;

&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Why? for some reason, I can always feel your existence, somewhere,
around the corner, in this city. Walking on the street in this massive
metropolitan, what's the odds that I could ever meet you again? Yet, I
can't shake the feeling that you are somewhere, somewhere really
close, somewhere I'm scared to look at, to look for.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Are you here? You must be. The rain, the endless winter drizzle, damp,
humid, chilly, not yet cold, and wind picks up, sometimes it makes you
shiver, sometimes it makes it feel like a early spring breeze. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I watched Lost In Translation again last night. Jet lagged, awake 11
at night, so I listened to it, and did some work. I felt really sad
when the guy said, "but I dont want to leave".. "then don't, we will
start a Jazz band".... it's sad, isn't it? How can I put it? I don't
want to leave. Yet, I can't be an anchor for you anymore to make your
life standing still. I'm not good enough for the glamour …&lt;/p&gt;</description><dc:creator xmlns:dc="http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/">Feng Xia</dc:creator><pubDate>Tue, 04 Dec 2018 18:54:00 -0500</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">tag:fengxia41103.github.io,2018-12-04:/myblog/missing you in this city.html</guid><category>thoughts</category><category>love</category></item><item><title>Reveal slides</title><link>https://fengxia41103.github.io/myblog/reveal%20slides.html</link><description>&lt;div class="iframe-container"&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://github.com/hakimel/reveal.js/"&gt;reveal.js&lt;/a&gt; is pretty awesome. I have been using it for the last 9
months now and love it. It was a bit of hassle to set it up
initially. Once you have an example, yo can replicate and be
productive by copying and pasting existing one, and getting a
consistent look and workflow. And the results? amazing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;as photo album: &lt;a href="https://fengxia41103.github.io/moment/1236/"&gt;momoent&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;as for work: &lt;a href="https://fengxia41103.github.io/moment/netbox/"&gt;netbox&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;To create a new presentation&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The easiest way to create a new slides for your topic is to copy an
existing folder, eg. &lt;code&gt;netbox&lt;/code&gt;, and make modifications to your
contents.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Each folder should have the following contents:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="highlight"&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;code&gt;.
├──&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;images
├──&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;index.html
├──&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;my.css
└──&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;slides.md
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Only &lt;code&gt;index.html&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;.md&lt;/code&gt; are essential. &lt;code&gt;index.html&lt;/code&gt; is the overall
HTML shell that will be loaded by browser, and &lt;code&gt;.md&lt;/code&gt; are slide
contents that will be converted from Markdown into HTML and included
in &lt;code&gt;index.html&lt;/code&gt;. You can split your contents into multiple &lt;code&gt;.md&lt;/code&gt;
files, which we will cover in more details next.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;code&gt;my.css&lt;/code&gt; is used to make customized CSS change per …&lt;/p&gt;</description><dc:creator xmlns:dc="http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/">Feng Xia</dc:creator><pubDate>Tue, 27 Nov 2018 09:26:00 -0500</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">tag:fengxia41103.github.io,2018-11-27:/myblog/reveal slides.html</guid><category>dev</category><category>thoughts</category></item><item><title>IBB brain shutdown procedure</title><link>https://fengxia41103.github.io/myblog/ibb%20brain%20shutdown%20procedure.html</link><description>&lt;p&gt;This document describes procedure to shutdown an IBB brain instance.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So Noah's school called yesterday. During lunch the kids at his table
played truth or dare. Noah dared, a girl, to &lt;code&gt;rape&lt;/code&gt;..... geee.. I was
totally speechless and didn't even understand where he could have
picked up that concept. Teacher said she felt this is a topic she
should leave to parents to talk him about... so he and I had a talk on
the way to Kumon.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The good things is that he admitted he said so, not like before that
he would try to get out of it by denying or finding other excuses
like "but the other kid started it". So where did he get that idea? He
said I told him that!!.. what!? How? where? .. "you remember the movie
we watched yesterday?" "which movie!?" "The Japanese samurai movie."
"Samurai movie?.... oh, you mean, the one in which that guy killed

&lt;p&gt;Oh mine mine.... so he is referring to this movie &amp;mdash; &lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MdIm_i5vAzU"&gt;Satan's
Sword: The Dragon God (1960)- Raizō Ichikawa&lt;/a&gt;, in which …&lt;/p&gt;</description><dc:creator xmlns:dc="http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/">Feng Xia</dc:creator><pubDate>Fri, 16 Nov 2018 10:37:00 -0500</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">tag:fengxia41103.github.io,2018-11-16:/myblog/bad words.html</guid><category>thoughts</category><category>thoughts</category></item><item><title>Domain knowledge</title><link>https://fengxia41103.github.io/myblog/domain%20knowledge.html</link><description>&lt;figure class="col l6 m6 s12"&gt;
  &lt;img src="images/world%20domination.jpg"/&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;What is a domain knowledge? Domain knowledge implies a knowing of a
specific area of knowledge, like plumber knows plumbing. It's quite
easy to picture that everyone, or should say every profession, is a
its own domain, thus has its own knowledge, which in true, in the same
sense that goes by a Chinese saying, 隔行如隔山. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;However, if we take it broadly, I would argue everything, every
person, has a domain knowledge of a sort that is unique only to that
person. Watching those "10 coolest hand-made toys" youtube videos make
you wonder how creative this person is, how much time s/he has at
hand, and deep down you also know that your brain is not up that, even
given you as much time &amp;mdash; you two are simply, different. Thus,
wouldn't it be fair to say that his/her domain knowledge is different
from yours then!? I think so. No two people are alike, which not only
means that no two people look identically, but also emphasizes their
knowledge repository …&lt;/p&gt;</description><dc:creator xmlns:dc="http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/">Feng Xia</dc:creator><pubDate>Sat, 10 Nov 2018 04:50:00 -0500</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">tag:fengxia41103.github.io,2018-11-10:/myblog/domain knowledge.html</guid><category>thoughts</category><category>thoughts</category></item><item><title>Addiction</title><link>https://fengxia41103.github.io/myblog/addiction.html</link><description>&lt;figure class="col l5 m6 s12"&gt;
  &lt;img src="images/understand%20fashion.jpg"/&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;What is an addiction then!? and why is this word negative!? I
think when we talk about this word, the implied message logic is that
&lt;em&gt;it is bad because it puts a person into an &lt;strong&gt;extreme&lt;/strong&gt; condition,
thus is not sustainable, thus is not healthy&lt;/em&gt; &amp;larr; so there are
quite a few assumptions:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Extreme state is, bad (but is it bad because of #2 below, that it
   is not sustainable!? or, regardless it is sustainable or not, it is
   just bad being in any kind of extreme? and is there such a thing as
   "extreme &amp;amp; good"?).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Unsustainable is no good. Well, this is actually interesting then,
   because then I would ask, what is the sustainable state!? Is
   drinking water instead of being an alcoholic more sustainable!? Is
   it defined as being able to live longer, thus more &lt;em&gt;sustainable&lt;/em&gt;?
   or less likely to be bored of!? This last one must not be true
   then, because alcoholics don't get bore of liquors, thus definition
   of this word, alcoholic!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So, it is not whether you will be tire of …&lt;/p&gt;</description><dc:creator xmlns:dc="http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/">Feng Xia</dc:creator><pubDate>Thu, 08 Nov 2018 20:37:00 -0500</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">tag:fengxia41103.github.io,2018-11-08:/myblog/addiction.html</guid><category>thoughts</category><category>thoughts</category></item><item><title>A better world</title><link>https://fengxia41103.github.io/myblog/a%20better%20world.html</link><description>&lt;figure class="col s12"&gt;

&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It has been a fascinating thought to me &amp;mdash; is human the only
specie who thinks about leaving a better world for their children?
This perception, or statement, has been widely used in many talks,
conversations, lectures, debates, and propaganda, that by doing so and
so, we are to leave our children a better world. Or, often presented
in the opposite way, that by not doing so and so, we are leaving them
with a less world than ours, and shouldn't this give us, the current
generation, the moms and dads, a strong incentive to change!?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is how NPR's discussion of climate change has presented
itself. On one hand, I have been talking to Noah about becoming a
vegetarian. By eating less meat (here I'm also blindly taking someone
else's statement as truth &amp;larr; individually by eating less meat, we
could make our contribution to help the climate change catestrophe),
we are doing our share to help a change. But on the other, I was
thinking to myself, &lt;strong&gt;why leaving them with a better world is …&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</description><dc:creator xmlns:dc="http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/">Feng Xia</dc:creator><pubDate>Thu, 01 Nov 2018 10:57:00 -0400</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">tag:fengxia41103.github.io,2018-11-01:/myblog/a better world.html</guid><category>thoughts</category><category>thoughts</category></item><item><title>Early morning</title><link>https://fengxia41103.github.io/myblog/early%20morning.html</link><description>&lt;figure class="col s12"&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I'm getting used to getting up early to feed them. But I still can't
get used to not thinking of you, when I'm awake, when I'm lying there
in an early winter morning like this. Where are you?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I don't know where you are anymore, nor hear from you of anything in
your life. Sometimes I feel quite upset about this, that I'm now out
of your life, maybe even for the rest of it, that I am nothing but a
stranger to you, like million others in that city, in this world. Yet,
you are not someone whom I only bump into on a street. The days, the
moments kept coming back to me, day and night.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I haven't had a nice afternoon nap like yesterday for a long time.
Noah and his mom were at church. Waking up, a room filled with cozy
sunshine, and zhu wawa cuddling next to me, twisting left and right,
as if don't know how to show off his cuteness and his yearning for
love anymore, stretching stretching …&lt;/p&gt;</description><dc:creator xmlns:dc="http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/">Feng Xia</dc:creator><pubDate>Mon, 29 Oct 2018 04:32:00 -0400</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">tag:fengxia41103.github.io,2018-10-29:/myblog/early morning.html</guid><category>thoughts</category><category>love</category></item><item><title>SPA: a cofiguration Dashboard</title><link>https://fengxia41103.github.io/myblog/project%20spa%20dashboard%20demo.html</link><description>&lt;figure class="s12 center"&gt;

&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="https://fengxia41103.github.io/spa-dashboard/"&gt;Demo&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="https://github.com/fengxia41103/spa-dashboard"&gt;Code&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Project SPA Dashboard is a weekend fun. The idea came from Lenovo Open
Cloud project, in which we have developed auto deployment of a complex
stack on three physical servers. Services are Red Hat software
deployed on a RHHI instance. Previously we have maintained a table
(shown below) of URLs to these services since VM's IP and hostname are
pre-determined. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;figure class="s12 center"&gt;
    &lt;img src="images/ibb%20rack%201%20cheatsheet.png" /&gt;
    &lt;figcaption&gt;IBB example cheatsheet&lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;However, since we have achieved daily deployment using playbook and
&lt;code&gt;extra_vars&lt;/code&gt; as input, it is possible to generate a &lt;em&gt;dashboard&lt;/em&gt;
representing a deployment instance with these actual config values,
thus eliminating manual maintenance of a static wiki page.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For example, here is part of the config file of&lt;code&gt;Satellite&lt;/code&gt; VM:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="highlight"&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class="nt"&gt;vm_name&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="l l-Scalar l-Scalar-Plain"&gt;brain1-satellite &amp;lt;-- host name&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It is, I think, the darkest moment in history, that I have been
experienced in this great country. Listening to senator hearing for
the first time last Thursday, and I was both impressed by the
capability to grasp the core of the issue that these senators
demonstrated, and the disturbing display by this guy who is bitter,
angry, aggressive, eager to please his boss, and not hesitating to
express a statement in the form of a conspiracy, even linking it to
"the Clintons", who, regardless what type of opponent they have been
in the presidential race, not to mention that Mr. Clinton has been a
real president elected and was doing a good job by the measure of
economy. What type of person would this guy be that he is now being
bestowed the &lt;strong&gt;super power&lt;/strong&gt; of being a life-long employed judge
sitting on the bench of a sacred institution, which I have always
viewed with awe and respect, because I thought it holds all the wisdom
in this world despite how hard, how difficult …&lt;/p&gt;</description><dc:creator xmlns:dc="http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/">Feng Xia</dc:creator><pubDate>Sat, 06 Oct 2018 09:17:00 -0400</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">tag:fengxia41103.github.io,2018-10-06:/myblog/law.html</guid><category>thoughts</category><category>thoughts</category></item><item><title>Dictator, human language, concept</title><link>https://fengxia41103.github.io/myblog/dictator.html</link><description>&lt;figure class="col l6 m6 s12"&gt;

&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Here is a really interesting conversation with Noah. We have been
watching a documentary (&lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JhXKlYnSWjA"&gt;Soviet Storm: World War II — In The
East.&lt;/a&gt;). At his age he is absorbed to the war scenes. Then, driving
from his school we were talking about how Russia fought the war, he
started saying that Stalin is the head of all Russian troops, and he
quoted a &lt;em&gt;famous order&lt;/em&gt; by him that no one can retreat (I think he was
talking about the Leninggrad).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So I said, you know, Stalin was actually a terrible person. "Why?"
"Cause he is a dictator." "What is a dictator?" I actually don't
know. I tried to come up with a definition, "Dictator is someone who
does not like disagreement. He only wants what he wants." "Oh"&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Then, we were talking about German, "Hitler is a dictator, too." I
said. "No!" "What do you mean by no!?" I was rather &lt;strong&gt;alarmed&lt;/strong&gt;!
"Adolf is not a dictator!" He said it in such an affirmative tone that
I was truly start to wonder what type of message …&lt;/p&gt;</description><dc:creator xmlns:dc="http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/">Feng Xia</dc:creator><pubDate>Fri, 05 Oct 2018 10:39:00 -0400</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">tag:fengxia41103.github.io,2018-10-05:/myblog/dictator.html</guid><category>thoughts</category><category>thoughts</category></item><item><title>Imagination is life</title><link>https://fengxia41103.github.io/myblog/imagination%20is%20life.html</link><description>&lt;figure class="col l8 m8 s12"&gt;

&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It has been said that what makes human &lt;em&gt;superior to&lt;/em&gt; (or different
from) other species on this planet is that human is the only one that
can imagine; others operate off facts and reality. They do not possess
the skill (or the brain capacity) to imagine a virtual world,
something that is not there, that is &lt;em&gt;maybe&lt;/em&gt;, that is possible.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is quite interesting, because it definitely feels so &amp;mdash; we
are often moved and motivated by a futuristic view, which may or may
not pan out to be the case. Yet we get excited about it, work hard
based on such projection, and gets disappointed if it doesn't realize
the way we &lt;em&gt;want&lt;/em&gt;. So is love, is life.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I was thinking today while limping along &amp;rarr; what makes of life?
what makes one full of life?  why getting old makes one, less lively,
appearing to have less life?  Is it really the beauty, the young skin,
the age? These are rather, factual. There is no denial that elders
don't look &lt;em&gt;as good&lt;/em&gt;, but that is also …&lt;/p&gt;</description><dc:creator xmlns:dc="http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/">Feng Xia</dc:creator><pubDate>Tue, 02 Oct 2018 18:28:00 -0400</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">tag:fengxia41103.github.io,2018-10-02:/myblog/imagination is life.html</guid><category>thoughts</category><category>thoughts</category></item><item><title>How hard is it to listen?</title><link>https://fengxia41103.github.io/myblog/hard%20to%20listen.html</link><description>&lt;figure class="col l6 m6 s12"&gt;

&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I guess it must be hard. Noah completely tipped me off again
today. His glasses were bent (slightly), and I asked him what
happened. He said there was nothing. Then he said yes he was hit by
somebody. Then the story turned out to be that he chose to be under
someone's chair during &lt;em&gt;independent reading&lt;/em&gt; time, and the kid kicked
into his face, somehow. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I was totally mad! on multiple degrees!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;First, lie. I hate this. If you  did it, admit it. Don't try to wiggle
out of it,  especially when you are  only, what, 10!? There  is no way
you are going to fool me yet. And, didn't we just talk about this last
week, that  any lie will  only lead  to more lies  so it rolls  like a
snowball until a spectacular fall. The longer you can cover it up, the
messier it will be  when it crashes. I know kid  doesn't this yet. But
this is a lesson in life, and he needs to learn it, needs to memorizes
this, needs …&lt;/p&gt;</description><dc:creator xmlns:dc="http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/">Feng Xia</dc:creator><pubDate>Mon, 01 Oct 2018 18:10:00 -0400</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">tag:fengxia41103.github.io,2018-10-01:/myblog/hard to listen.html</guid><category>thoughts</category><category>thoughts</category></item><item><title>Total Happiness</title><link>https://fengxia41103.github.io/myblog/total%20happiness.html</link><description>&lt;figure class="col s12"&gt;

&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I was thinking. If we add up the total happiness of this world, versus
all the grief, sadness, unhappiness, how would they come out to be?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I'm depressed. Noah is not doing his homework at school, and he is
moving too much in class, as usual. It pissed me off, and made me
really feeling powerless. He is refusing to grow up, but I'm getting
old, and nothing is being done. While I was feeling the blues, I start
to wonder everyone I saw roaming around the campus whether s/he has a
blue day also. I'm sure everybody has. I have long been convinced that
there is nobody's life you would be willing to swap once you learn how
messy and imperfect theirs is. Just like mine, just like yours.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So if we ever add them all up, are there more happiness than
unhappiness? On the one hand, we will all agree that happy time is
much less than unhappy time in one's life. So it seems that by sheer
number unhappiness will win …&lt;/p&gt;</description><dc:creator xmlns:dc="http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/">Feng Xia</dc:creator><pubDate>Wed, 26 Sep 2018 10:45:00 -0400</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">tag:fengxia41103.github.io,2018-09-26:/myblog/total happiness.html</guid><category>thoughts</category><category>thoughts</category></item><item><title>Life without meaning</title><link>https://fengxia41103.github.io/myblog/life%20without%20meaning.html</link><description>&lt;figure class="col l6 m6 s12"&gt;

&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I don't know. All of a sudden while walking back from gym to office, I
felt this moment of, emptiness. Really. It's a sensation I never had
before. It's not a strong feeling, but distinctly there, that life is
blank, meaningless.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I lost the touch of what it is for, what there is to looked forward
to, what is in there for me. The sky is blue, temperature comfortable,
nothing dramatic in life, everyday is a routine. Why I had this
feeling then?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I missed you a lot today. I wanted to write you something. But we are
soo far apart now, I don't even know what to call you anymore. I feel
awkward to begin a letter, though I so want to chat with you, to learn
what you are up to, how life has treated you, and whether you are
happy. I'm worried. There have been many disturbing nights I dreamed
of you. Waking up in the middle of night, I wanted to talk to you,
hear your voice, to know you are …&lt;/p&gt;</description><dc:creator xmlns:dc="http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/">Feng Xia</dc:creator><pubDate>Wed, 19 Sep 2018 10:45:00 -0400</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">tag:fengxia41103.github.io,2018-09-19:/myblog/life without meaning.html</guid><category>thoughts</category><category>love</category></item><item><title>Burned out</title><link>https://fengxia41103.github.io/myblog/burned%20out.html</link><description>&lt;figure class="col l4 m4 s12"&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I feel caught in a turmoil the last couple weeks that I had to deliver
this BOM while I know nothing about, and had to deliver a schedule
which many works have not even been defined, to determine a list of
designs which no one else is looking at or willing to do, and to
decide what to do with my life which has rekted in pieces, and I have
no clue of what to do w/ it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I miss Dad, miss her, miss the days I was happy, miss when Noah was
little, miss biking around the Charles and watch the sunset, miss the
moment we were sitting on top of 南山 that evening, watching the city
lights and breathing the summer breeze, miss the time in Sanyo center
overseeing the unnamed bay in Kobe, what a wonder ocean is! miss the
time Elaine introduced me this beautiful song then which till today I
know not the name nor the singer, but its tune by heart, miss the mini
karaoke in Shenzhen's arcade …&lt;/p&gt;</description><dc:creator xmlns:dc="http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/">Feng Xia</dc:creator><pubDate>Tue, 18 Sep 2018 10:36:00 -0400</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">tag:fengxia41103.github.io,2018-09-18:/myblog/burned out.html</guid><category>thoughts</category><category>thoughts</category></item><item><title>2nd Child Policy</title><link>https://fengxia41103.github.io/myblog/2nd%20child%20policy.html</link><description>&lt;figure class="col s12"&gt;

&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iL5PnFojoj8"&gt;This&lt;/a&gt; has to be the most disturbing talk I have ever heard so far, and
this makes me very angry.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The talk is about China's new policy to encourage having more than one
child, and these people talked about possible ways to turn the tide of
China's declining population.  Sigh. But this is truly sad sad sad in
multiple ways  and it is  totally disgusting, misleading,  wrong, just
morally wrong,  technically wrong,  politically wrong,  and absolutely
against humanity!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;180 turn&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;No where they every even dared to touch the No.1 topic I think they
should have discussed &amp;larr; this is truly an elephant in the room,
yet everybody turns his head and as if it doesn't exist!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;How can a country reverse its one-child policy, the one that has been
criticized by human right group, by UN, by everybody except China
itself, just like that!&lt;/strong&gt; How can this be acceptable!!! This speaks to
a case in point of China's opaque decision making process that a
policy that was sooo dear and soooo important that if …&lt;/p&gt;</description><dc:creator xmlns:dc="http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/">Feng Xia</dc:creator><pubDate>Thu, 13 Sep 2018 19:19:00 -0400</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">tag:fengxia41103.github.io,2018-09-13:/myblog/2nd child policy.html</guid><category>thoughts</category><category>thoughts</category></item><item><title>Hurricane</title><link>https://fengxia41103.github.io/myblog/hurricane.html</link><description>&lt;figure class="col l6 m6 s12"&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So there is a hurricane coming to NC. The curious thing, however, is
that there is an air of excitement in the air &amp;larr; everybody is
rushing to grocery to stock up food, people calling each other just to
exchange that &lt;code&gt;Costco has run out of water since yesterday&lt;/code&gt;.. actually
now thinking back, I think this same pattern has played out also when
Boston was hit by snow storms, that people were both nervous and
excited.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To think of it, I think this speaks about human psychie. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;First of all, this risk is certainly not really being taken as a risk,
at all. Let me ask you this, if this risk is plainly a risk that you
won't survive if caught in it, will you even feel any chance of "yeah
let's go to buy some bottle water!?" The underline message of this
madness is that all these people are 100% sure that they will survive,
they will be fine, and hardly they even expect their daily convenience
will be interrupted at all &amp;larr; here is my …&lt;/p&gt;</description><dc:creator xmlns:dc="http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/">Feng Xia</dc:creator><pubDate>Mon, 10 Sep 2018 16:37:00 -0400</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">tag:fengxia41103.github.io,2018-09-10:/myblog/hurricane.html</guid><category>thoughts</category><category>thoughts</category></item><item><title>Accelerated anonymity</title><link>https://fengxia41103.github.io/myblog/accelerated%20anonymity.html</link><description>&lt;p&gt;It feels that everything is converging. Sometimes I feel this is the
sign of aging, too, that by being in 40s and started to understand
just about every topic and have an opinion of them, every book I read
and every talk I listen to start to convey the same message and
contribute to my way of logic in a supportative way. This is both
assuring, and alarming &amp;mdash; I enjoy the sense that my view finds
more agreement and seemingly more supports, but am deeply worried that
I'm being cherry picking of evidence actively so to find comfort and
enforce an already formed view. The the latter I am truly concerned
because this is exactly the behavior and symptom I am advocating
against. Yet, like everything in life, there seems to be built-in
contradiction in everything &amp;mdash; that your strength must also be
your weakness, the most you think you believe and you want to promote
turns to be the exact opposite of your preach! I don't know. I feel

It has
been talked about as if it would be the root cause of all disturbing
social phenomenon as well as the one single cure of all social disease
&amp;larr; if only there were trust between people, between vendor and
customer, between government and its subordinates, between investor
and business owners... especially w/ backdrop of ZTE (which is being
depicted as a case of &lt;code&gt;not keeping its promise&lt;/code&gt;) and the most recent
fatal crime by Didi driver. &lt;strong&gt;We want trust; we need trust; let's
restore trust.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But, and this is really a big BUT. But, I would argue exactly the
opposite! No, this society is not lacking trust. On the contrary,
China lacks criticism, suspicion, argument, challenge,
show-me-the-proof mentality. The very last thing they should promote
is exactly not trust, but everything that speaks and yells and shouts
with a stern, dirty, annoying look "I don't trust!".&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That's right. You heard me. Isn't the blind trust that people dive
into whatever the government's policy says …&lt;/p&gt;</description><dc:creator xmlns:dc="http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/">Feng Xia</dc:creator><pubDate>Tue, 28 Aug 2018 17:37:00 -0400</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">tag:fengxia41103.github.io,2018-08-28:/myblog/too much trust.html</guid><category>thoughts</category><category>thoughts</category></item><item><title>On Noah's 10th birthday</title><link>https://fengxia41103.github.io/myblog/on%20noah%2010th%20birthday.html</link><description>&lt;figure class="col s12"&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Hard to believe, the guy is 10 years old now. I can still feel the
day, the day that he was coming to this world, and the day it was a
hot summer day, and I was biking between hospital and home. He came at
1pm, the same time when my brother passed away. I joked that he was
him reborn into this family. This gave my moom, and everyone in the
family, a comfort, that he is back to us again, in Noah's body, and
will be loved and cherished and spoiled, as if it is a second chance
for everybody, like a lost, found.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I wanted to believe that myself, too. I missed Lei. It is becoming
less frequent now that I will think of him. But he is still there. I
wish there were more I could have done at the time, to ease his
pain. I wish I had been more mature, more independent, and more
thoughtful, and more wise perhaps, to know what to do, and to do what

&lt;p&gt;This is a really a &lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vsMydMDi3rI"&gt;fascinating person&lt;/a&gt;. He is eloquent, which I
have the impression that his mind runs million miles per second. You
can feel it's churning at a speed so to compose the next line and the
next thought, which now while writing, feels so different from &lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Mg5_gxNXTo"&gt;Linus&lt;/a&gt;,
whose Q&amp;amp;A sessions filled w/ pauses that he would try to express his
view while choosing words, but at the end of day it was just a topic
he had no feeling of, and no interest in, which quite like what I feel
these days &amp;rarr; you feel compelled to express if you have a view and
have a feeling of something, someone; while for others, well, I really
don't care, and have no interested in saying anything, whether it is
pleasing to audience or not.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What touched me, and got me think today, is Frank said about
technology. He asked technology to think harder how people can use it
in a &lt;code&gt;self-serving&lt;/code&gt; way, and to build a box around it so to circumvent

&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The recent downfall of Facebook stock and its data privacy fiasco have
been spectacular, and saddening. People are talking about data privacy
as if it is an evil just releases from Gene's bottle, and of course,
when a giant like Facebook shows a crack, millions are worked up to
bring it dow, for its great tragedy that years later all MBA books and
zillion talks on evolution of technology will have a lot of fun to awe
its audience, and for profiting from such a downfall if only it is so
predictable and exciting, like any revolution that mobs are bringing
down the ruling authority and everyone sees an opportunity to
reshuffle the social deck he or she has been given, and maybe this
time a better card will be in hand.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;All in all, this is a true irony, that the social networking giant is
facing a social force that it both created, and in an arena he is the
king.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But really, what I want to talk about is something even more
fundamental …&lt;/p&gt;</description><dc:creator xmlns:dc="http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/">Feng Xia</dc:creator><pubDate>Fri, 03 Aug 2018 21:00:00 -0400</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">tag:fengxia41103.github.io,2018-08-03:/myblog/social media.html</guid><category>thoughts</category><category>thoughts</category></item><item><title>UML</title><link>https://fengxia41103.github.io/myblog/uml.html</link><description>&lt;p&gt;Finally &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/Driven-Object-Modeling-UMLTheory-Practice/dp/1590597745"&gt;a book on UML&lt;/a&gt; that makes sense to me (and is short enough
so I was willing to read it, in one morning). &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;Milestone 1: requirement review&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Everything starts with an analysis of the problem at hand. One thing
learned and I'd like to clarify is &lt;code&gt;requirement&lt;/code&gt; &amp;mdash;
it is a set of &lt;strong&gt;constraints&lt;/strong&gt; (thus the word &lt;code&gt;must&lt;/code&gt;,
&lt;code&gt;should&lt;/code&gt;). Requirements often cause confusion as they are taken as the
system's objectives &amp;rarr; in essence they are, but they are measured
as a set of &lt;strong&gt;conditions&lt;/strong&gt; that the system will have to &lt;strong&gt;behave
within boundary&lt;/strong&gt;. Thus, viewing them as the &lt;strong&gt;law for your
design&lt;/strong&gt;, it's a valid test to your test, but your design
can come in many forms, and that's where engineering has some fun.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So it becomes clear &amp;amp; natural that design and implementation are like
people living in society &amp;rarr; his behavior is completly boxed by law
he has to obey, that's the minimal.  Anything that no law permits nor
prohibits (functions that links to no requirements), well, is just to
keep the developers happy.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I had a dream, as vivid as it can be, that I was walking next to
you. You were wearing the black dress, the one you look so refined and
elegant in. I reached out to your hand, but you retrieved it inside
your sleeve, and only after a couple tries that I was able to hold it
in mine. I couldn't tell whether you were happy or not. You were
probably reluctant.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But, at the moment, I felt so happy. It was like something long lost
found, well, it is, a person long lost, found. Then I woke up. 2:30 in
the morning. I wanted to text you to tell you that I have a dream of
you, again, and it hasn't been there fore a while, and I was really
scared that you stopped coming to my dream. Now you are there, again.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But, I didn't. It's really a struggle for me whether I should continue
to be present in your life, or should disappear altogether so that you
could have yours …&lt;/p&gt;</description><dc:creator xmlns:dc="http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/">Feng Xia</dc:creator><pubDate>Fri, 20 Jul 2018 10:33:00 -0400</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">tag:fengxia41103.github.io,2018-07-20:/myblog/a dream.html</guid><category>thoughts</category><category>love</category></item><item><title>Not feeling well, today</title><link>https://fengxia41103.github.io/myblog/not%20feeling%20well%20today.html</link><description>&lt;figure class="col s12"&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I miss 米粒儿和米答应. Sometimes I feel really sorry that I feel like
I have walked out of their life. Maybe she feels that way, too. But
then I know I didn't. I didn't mean to, and I did what I said I would,
I didn't lie or being insincere about the future and how we could
be. I did what I meant to do, and I needed to do it not only because I
cared, but I meant to get myself ready so I could do what I committed
to do.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But sometimes I feel it was taken in the wrong way, or maybe it was
just timing and pressure and temptation and everything else. There
were signs that she has wavered, though I had been aware but didn't
want to admit. Then, for 米粒儿 &amp;amp; 米答应, they probably didn't
understand any of these. Poor little things.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;img src="images/boomerang.png"/&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Wow, this is quite unbelievable! I read a line:"A mind is a terrible
thing to waste." (looking it up, there is an &lt;a href="https://www.npr.org/sections/codeswitch/2013/06/14/191796469/a-mind-is-a-terrible-thing-to"&gt;NPR&lt;/a&gt;!) yes I have
always remembered this line, because it is so true &amp;mdash; despite
that I have been losing faith of human being in general, I do consider
a mind, well, regardless it is doing good or evil, is a terrible thing
to waste. After all, I think the mind is the one only thing that human
may come out of his own misery. Reading books always gives me this,
false hope maybe, that once a while, just about everything goes into
darkness, there is some mind, somewhere, somehow, wired so
differently, that sparks a light, that gives, hope.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The recent movie of &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dying_to_Survive"&gt;"Dying to Survive"&lt;/a&gt; is another case in point,
that goods came out of something so original, so humble, so remote
from being grand, memorable, plausible, beneficial. This feels almost
like the argument that free market ppl like to say the best drive to
create something good is the individual's …&lt;/p&gt;</description><dc:creator xmlns:dc="http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/">Feng Xia</dc:creator><pubDate>Thu, 12 Jul 2018 17:13:00 -0400</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">tag:fengxia41103.github.io,2018-07-12:/myblog/waste of mind.html</guid><category>thoughts</category><category>thoughts</category></item><item><title>Development</title><link>https://fengxia41103.github.io/myblog/development.html</link><description>&lt;p&gt;This is a quite fascinating argument, and quite unexpected when I'm
reading this book, &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/Mosquitoes-Malaria-Man-History-Hostilities/dp/0525160256"&gt;Mosquitoes, Malaria and Man&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As  for typing  public health  efforts to  development, WHO  takes its
stand  on  popular  but  treacherous ground.  One  reason  eradication
failed, the argument  goes, is that governments were  not convinced it
was   worthwhile  and   were  unwilling   to  push   it  or   pay  for
it.  Malariologists, negelected  to bring  out cost-benefit  models to
prove that it may pay more than it costs to keep people healthy.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now it is  notoriously difficult to put a value  on human life, though
many  economists are  perennially  willing to  try.  But the  exercise
becomes superficially plausible if you  assume that development is the
social objective, axiomatically to be  considered good, by which other
values are tested. Then the worth of  a man may be reckoned as what he
contributed  during  a   normal  life  span  to   the  gross  national
product. If he dies prematurely the  years of useful labor cut off are
lost and consistute a social cost. If  he is by a measurable …&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;</description><dc:creator xmlns:dc="http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/">Feng Xia</dc:creator><pubDate>Thu, 05 Jul 2018 21:52:00 -0400</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">tag:fengxia41103.github.io,2018-07-05:/myblog/development.html</guid><category>thoughts</category><category>thoughts</category></item><item><title>China witness</title><link>https://fengxia41103.github.io/myblog/china%20witness.html</link><description>&lt;p&gt;I have seen this &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/China-Witness-Voices-Silent-Generation/dp/0307388530"&gt;book&lt;/a&gt; on Reader's Corner's shelf for sometime,
and never felt I should pick it up and read. The book didn't feel like
a kind of book I would like to read, "Personal interviews!?" I thought
ot myself, "that is a common cheap method to get some moving and
touching feeling to reader while the author/cook puts in nothing much
but to collect and compile them." That's my thought, like I always
look down on those army of real estate agents hovering around a condo
complex in China these days &amp;larr; what they do own/contribute!?
anything!? They didn't own the unit, didn't even do much of a homework
to collect information of it. As a matter of fact, many of them
deliberately present you the &lt;strong&gt;wrong&lt;/strong&gt; information so they can play a
scheme on you, like hooking you with a couple interesting one, one too
cheap for your budget and one too much over yours, so the strategy
predicts that you will then settle on the next one, the mid-range one …&lt;/p&gt;</description><dc:creator xmlns:dc="http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/">Feng Xia</dc:creator><pubDate>Mon, 02 Jul 2018 13:54:00 -0400</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">tag:fengxia41103.github.io,2018-07-02:/myblog/china witness.html</guid><category>thoughts</category><category>thoughts</category></item><item><title>Generalization</title><link>https://fengxia41103.github.io/myblog/generalization.html</link><description>&lt;figure class="col s12 center"&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I have been thinking, is generalization good, or bad, or inevitable? I
kinda of wonder that looking at something, especially something new,
in a generalized term, is actually inevitable. Watching Noah learning
things since young, he has to generalize things in order to recognize
anything &amp;mdash; this is a dog, that is a cat. Over the weekend I got
a few mosquito bites which annoyed me to hell. Then I was thinking
about the book I picked up last week, something about the history of
Malaria, which to many runs that mosquito is spreading virus, thus if
we could eliminate mosquito entirely (as a specie), then we are good.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Well, then I was thinking, among that gazillion mosquitoes, are we now
just  viewing ALL  of them  as a  single identity,  a unified  blob of
living thing with a set of common  traits, and how many of us have any
idea how many  mosquitoes out there!? I bet there  are many. Then, how
many among  them are  actually the  cause Malaria?   I don't  know.  I

Infrastructure needs to be managed, but then, what does
it mean? Borrowing from wiki, a view can be:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Asset Management&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Network connectivity Management&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Environment Management&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Energy Management&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Change Management and&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Capacity Management&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD) Integration[17]&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This type of view is based on an attribute of object that we are
managing &amp;mdash; serial number is logged in asset management,
utilization is likely in energy management, and how full the rack is
falls in capacity management, and so on.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;View of attributes&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;However, I think such a view is inadequate because it artificially
break an attribute into multiple systems, thus creating a boundary
and possibility that the same attribute may not present, or not
defined in an agree-ed way, thus its data and meaning becomes a
conflict rather than an added-value. The situation becomes even worse
when certain aspect of this attribute is a moving target,
eg. interface changes a name, or VLAN gets re-named. Are these
networking management? or asset management?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To give an example: what does it mean when a server …&lt;/p&gt;</description><dc:creator xmlns:dc="http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/">Feng Xia</dc:creator><pubDate>Tue, 12 Jun 2018 09:20:00 -0400</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">tag:fengxia41103.github.io,2018-06-12:/myblog/capability model.html</guid><category>thoughts</category><category>dev</category></item><item><title>Lights</title><link>https://fengxia41103.github.io/myblog/lights.html</link><description>&lt;p&gt;Walking out from a shadow after a morning gym session, my eyes were
blinded, for a while, as if I was walking across a border between two
worlds, a new life? a re-birth? It felt good, when the summer heat hit
on your skin that has just emerged from a A/C indoor, as if the air
made me to breath again, here is air, here is sun, here is full of
green, full of life, a dragonfly, robin birds, grass that magically
move on its own. I thought there were bugs inside, but it was just
growing, literally in front of your eyes. How wonderful! and how 神奇!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I got this Chinese-English dictionary yesterday, and looked up your
name. There wasn't anything I did not already know, but still, you are
magical, just like what your name says, magical.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Sitting in Lucky Tree with Noah yesterday evening was a wonderful

You will need (ip, username, pwd) to get to it,
using Telnet(!). Your friend is &lt;a href="https://pexpect.readthedocs.io/en/stable/"&gt;pexpect&lt;/a&gt;, but even that gives you
jinx sometimes when each switch can return you some random garbages
once a while that makes &lt;code&gt;session.expect("your regex pattern")&lt;/code&gt; to time
out and you don't know why.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;enos vs. cnos&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Not much to say. These are two switch OS seen on Feng switches. They
are all closely looked like Cisco's &lt;a href="https://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/td/docs/ios-xml/ios/security/s1/sec-s1-xe-3se-5700-cr-book/sec-s1-xe-3se-5700-cr-book_chapter_010.html"&gt;IOS&lt;/a&gt;, but different. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="http://systemx.lenovofiles.com/help/topic/com.lenovo.rackswitch.g8272.doc/CNOS_AG_10-3.pdf"&gt;CNOS manual&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="http://systemx.lenovofiles.com/help/topic/com.lenovo.rackswitch.g8272.doc/G8272_CR_8-4.pdf"&gt;ENOS commands&lt;/a&gt; (Googling &lt;code&gt;enos manual&lt;/code&gt; shows Feng switch
   types, eg. G8272. So I guess the term is applicable on a model basis.)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Anyway, the biggest difference to be aware is that CNOS device uses &lt;code&gt;display&lt;/code&gt;
while ENOS device uses &lt;code&gt;show&lt;/code&gt;. To get a list of commands available:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;CNOS: &lt;code&gt;display ?&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="highlight"&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class="err"&gt;``&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="no"&gt;`shell&lt;/span&gt;

But we need more. Managing a lab or a rack is more than level 1. On
top of all these, we talk about automation, which implies capabilities
at least to level 4. Therefore, we used Netbox code as a starting
point, and built a POC.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;Background&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It has been a painful experience to witness how we are diagnosing
infrastructure, especially network connections, in a what I would call
&lt;code&gt;chasing the rabbit&lt;/code&gt; fashion in which &lt;code&gt;ping&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code&gt;route&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code&gt;vlan&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code&gt;port&lt;/code&gt;
on a switch, to which port the two ends of a cable plugged into, all
coming to a single chain of a &lt;code&gt;valid&lt;/code&gt; connection. Part of it is to
verify hardware connections (cablings), part of software
configurations (many layers deep). A knowledgeable person can traverse
the link from one end to the other, but even he is faced with a harsh
reality of which area is to focus on.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you think of it in the highest level &amp;mdash; a topology design, its
mirror image is …&lt;/p&gt;</description><dc:creator xmlns:dc="http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/">Feng Xia</dc:creator><pubDate>Wed, 06 Jun 2018 14:00:00 -0400</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">tag:fengxia41103.github.io,2018-06-06:/myblog/netbox.html</guid><category>dev</category><category>dev</category><category>lenovo</category></item><item><title>Moment of quietness</title><link>https://fengxia41103.github.io/myblog/moment%20of%20quietness.html</link><description>&lt;figure class="col s12 center"&gt;
  &lt;img src="images/buliaoqing.jpeg" style="width:50vw;"/&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It's quiet here. Office is deserted due to the upcoming long
weekend. It feels rather strange. Listening to the &lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MZqdlZ3juJI"&gt;song&lt;/a&gt; makes me to
think of you, and the days agains. Mr.Makato is still here. He is
always here early in the morning, and leave late at night. Is he is
alone? Doesn't he ever go home? Does he have a home?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I want to see you. This moment of quietness. A scene came to my mind,
that years later when I was still thinking of you, and my kids look at
me and you, and could not figure out what is soo good about you, like
when we look at others' love, you wonder what's so special of that
person to make him/her so hooked to it. For outsiders, it always looks
&lt;em&gt;unlikely&lt;/em&gt;, but for people who are the subjective, s/he can't help it.
So that's how I am feeling. I can't help it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Was ready to go home, to pick up Noah early so we can spend some time
together. I …&lt;/p&gt;</description><dc:creator xmlns:dc="http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/">Feng Xia</dc:creator><pubDate>Fri, 25 May 2018 16:00:00 -0400</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">tag:fengxia41103.github.io,2018-05-25:/myblog/moment of quietness.html</guid><category>thoughts</category><category>love</category></item><item><title>Must do, maybe</title><link>https://fengxia41103.github.io/myblog/must%20do.html</link><description>&lt;figure class="col l6 m6 s12"&gt;

&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I just had a thought &amp;mdash; many mid-age women claim that they feel
the best of themselves in this age band because they are independent,
self-sufficient, less anxious, not that they have fewer troubles in
life, but they view them as a matter-of-fact, just deal with it when
it comes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On one hand, the cliche is always that mid-age is a tough time because
we have fewer choices now than when we were young, but much more
obligation/responsibilities to fulfill, family, kids, parents, and so
on. Therefore there are many of the "I have to" scenarios, part of it
that it becomes a convenient execuse to do the things you want and to
dodge the things you don't like; on the other hand they do feel that
you have to do them because you are aware that alternatives (not
like before that you simply don't know what the alternative path can
lead to, thus were feeling hopeful because you didn't know better), if
any, is not that pretty and easy either. So might as well …&lt;/p&gt;</description><dc:creator xmlns:dc="http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/">Feng Xia</dc:creator><pubDate>Thu, 24 May 2018 09:15:00 -0400</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">tag:fengxia41103.github.io,2018-05-24:/myblog/must do.html</guid><category>thoughts</category><category>thoughts</category></item><item><title>How many can one love</title><link>https://fengxia41103.github.io/myblog/how%20many%20can%20one%20love.html</link><description>&lt;figure class="col l6 m6 s12"&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Train is an interesting, amazing thing. Never thought I will be
sitting on a train (CalTrain) which brought me a feeling of riding
train in China.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I haven't expected to see your messages, because I think it is the
right thing to do that I should disappear from your life
entirely. Watching a movie the other night, a line struck me &amp;mdash; a
woman said she hates a man, that she is now 39, and have not
married. I don't want you to be like that. I want you to move on your
life, because you have so much ahead of you. Don't waste time with
me. Don't. Everyone has a life to live, live yours, experience
yours. I feel like a parent who is watching over his child, knowing
all too well what is ahead of him, yet have to refrain from directing
his life &amp;mdash; if it were a fall, I could only be there when he
falls, and pull him out if I am able to. So that's how I feel,
watching the Californian …&lt;/p&gt;</description><dc:creator xmlns:dc="http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/">Feng Xia</dc:creator><pubDate>Mon, 14 May 2018 11:30:00 -0400</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">tag:fengxia41103.github.io,2018-05-14:/myblog/how many can one love.html</guid><category>thoughts</category><category>love</category></item><item><title>Technology and society</title><link>https://fengxia41103.github.io/myblog/technology%20and%20society.html</link><description>&lt;figure class="col s12"&gt;
  &lt;img src="images/fuji.jpg"/&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I have been thinking quite a bit about technology, and its
relationship to society. I used to be a firm believer, and a
practitioner, of technology. After all, it is what I do, and I
actually enjoying writing code and drawing diagrams to analyze a
problem at hand and to illustrate my thinkings.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;government knows more than we have imagined&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;However, while reading the book &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/Short-History-Chinese-Communism-Franklin/dp/0138094187/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&amp;amp;qid=1525356168&amp;amp;sr=8-1&amp;amp;keywords=short+history+of+the+chinese+communism"&gt;"Short history the Chinese
Communism"&lt;/a&gt;, I got a really deep impression that government, after
all, is not as ignorant, as I, or many others, have imaged. This book,
written in 1970s, has a quite good understanding of CCP's historical
events, its path till the writing, its organization, its agenda, and
its main players and who they are and what they do and have done. What
makes it even more impressive is that data are collected from official
channels, eg. gov publishing, party journals, which, in my previouly

&lt;p&gt;Yao Han introduced me to this &lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnoIxbIFU2A&amp;amp;t=10s"&gt;movie&lt;/a&gt;, at the time when we first
met and were in love. I was 27, she was 19. I don't know how many
times I have watched, listened to, and dreamed of, this movie. Each
time it touches me deeper and deeper, makes me wonder why two people
would love then go apart, marry yet think back, miss the other person
but continue to live a life without him/her. why?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It's a wonderful movie, a wonderful story. The guitar at Chen Li's
funeral always gets me, every, single, time. It's beautiful, it's sad,
it is a memory one can only dare to look at when the memory is about
to disappear forever, still pains, still hurts, still live, still
real.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I don't know. Sadness, a boundless ocean of sadness, surrounds me
when the music plays. I was talking to Noah's mom last night that I
don't get overwhelmed in emotion, thus I hardly found myself cry.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But this one, gets me, every, single, time.

&lt;p&gt;I was thinking. People get anxious on topic like bitcoin, why? Some
talk says because the feeling of "loss" is greater than the feeling of
"gain" even though the amount is the same. This has been proven in
stock books. But then, things like bitcoin, or success, is &lt;strong&gt;NOT&lt;/strong&gt; a
loss &amp;larr; you can only lose something if you had it already. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As you can see, many many many times, marketing or hooligans will
present this thing in a light of "them being finite" &amp;mdash; there are
only these many ocean view spots you can ever build a house for; there
is only these many bitcoins determined by its algorithm (and do we
have a math book on this algorithm!? and how much have we proven, on
paper, that its set is finite!? I mean, how do I know this statement
is true!?), and even life itself &amp;mdash; you can live once, so
maximize it (by doing ______ ). How familiar! but also how strange!
Why is this effective!? Why do you get anxious when the resource is
presented …&lt;/p&gt;</description><dc:creator xmlns:dc="http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/">Feng Xia</dc:creator><pubDate>Fri, 27 Apr 2018 10:56:00 -0400</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">tag:fengxia41103.github.io,2018-04-27:/myblog/finite anxiety.html</guid><category>thoughts</category><category>thoughts</category></item><item><title>Mid night</title><link>https://fengxia41103.github.io/myblog/mid%20night.html</link><description>&lt;figure class="col l6 m12 s12"&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Since coming back from Spring Break trip, my body and mind have been
really tired. Work is progressing fine. A lot of new things to learn,
but overall are quite manageable. But work is just, work. I was
sitting in this good looking, big kitchen 2 o'clock in the morning
after fixing a few things, but I really missed you.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Writing to you have become a habit, if not the only person I feel an
urge to talk to, to share what comes to my mind, if not what sits on
my soul. But I felt so lonely sometimes, since I don't know where you
are about, and where you will ever be anymore. I asked myself a lot
about whether there will be another time that our path will cross. But
I can't feel it anymore. It feels as strange as if we had never met. I
think it's better that way, I mean, to be able continue the path you
were on, and take me as an episode of fun that enriches your …&lt;/p&gt;</description><dc:creator xmlns:dc="http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/">Feng Xia</dc:creator><pubDate>Tue, 24 Apr 2018 00:00:00 -0400</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">tag:fengxia41103.github.io,2018-04-24:/myblog/mid night.html</guid><category>thoughts</category></item><item><title>Use RHEL server qcow2 as sandbox</title><link>https://fengxia41103.github.io/myblog/use%20rhel%20server%20qcow2%20as%20sandbox.html</link><description>&lt;p&gt;The closest thing RHEL has to a cloud image is a qcow (download from
&lt;a href="https://access.redhat.com/downloads/content/69/ver=/rhel---7/7.5/x86_64/product-software"&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;). This image has disabled root password, and disabled SSH
access &amp;larr; so what the heck!?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;Method 1: modify image directly&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Really ugly solution. Anyway. On a Ubuntu 16.04, install &lt;code&gt;guestfish&lt;/code&gt;
and &lt;code&gt;libguesttools&lt;/code&gt;, then:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;create root password&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Create a password to use. Note it is "digit 1", not a "l"
   (as in love):&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="highlight"&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;code&gt;```shell
$ openssl passwd -1 natalie
```
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Modify the image directly:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="highlight"&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;code&gt;```shell
$ sudo guestfish --rw -a rhel-server-7.5-x86_64-kvm.qcow2 
&amp;gt;&amp;lt;fs&amp;gt; run
&amp;gt;&amp;lt;fs&amp;gt; list-filesystems
&amp;gt;&amp;lt;fs&amp;gt; mount /dev/sda1 /
&amp;gt;&amp;lt;fs&amp;gt; vi /etc/shadow
```
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now replace the "!!" on line &lt;code&gt;root:...&lt;/code&gt; with your password you just
created in step 1, save,&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;allow ssh root &amp;amp; password&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Modify &lt;code&gt;/etc/ssh/sshd_config&lt;/code&gt; and uncomment two places:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="highlight"&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;code&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;lt;fs&amp;gt; vi /etc/ssh/sshd_config

&lt;span class="gh"&gt;#&lt;/span&gt; Authentication:

&lt;span class="gh"&gt;#&lt;/span&gt;LoginGraceTime 2m
PermitRootLogin yes &amp;lt;--- uncomment
&lt;span class="gh"&gt;#&lt;/span&gt;StrictModes yes
&lt;span class="gh"&gt;#&lt;/span&gt;MaxAuthTries 6
&lt;span class="gh"&gt;#&lt;/span&gt;MaxSessions 10

&lt;span class="gh"&gt;#&lt;/span&gt; To disable tunneled clear text passwords, change to no here!
PasswordAuthentication yes &amp;lt;-- uncomment
&lt;span class="gh"&gt;#&lt;/span&gt;PermitEmptyPasswords no
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;disable cloud-init&lt;/h2&gt;

There are minor difference
between 6.2 and 6.3. Grasp the concept here, and hopefully you will
have a good understanding of the Satellite models and procedures.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;Architecture&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;One&lt;/strong&gt; satellite server (master server), and &lt;strong&gt;1+&lt;/strong&gt; capsule servers.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The Satellite Server is required to connect to Red Hat
   Customer Portal &amp;larr; main source of RH packags, errata,
   Puppet modules.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The Satellite Server organizes the life cycle management by
   using &lt;code&gt;organizations&lt;/code&gt; as principal division units &amp;larr; one
   subscription manifest per org.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;code&gt;org&lt;/code&gt; &amp;rarr; &lt;code&gt;location&lt;/code&gt; creates a matrix &amp;rarr; 
   3 org and 4 location will create &lt;code&gt;3x4=12&lt;/code&gt; management contexts.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;code&gt;location&lt;/code&gt; is then tied to a capsule server (isolated).&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Info flow: external source &amp;rarr; main server &amp;rarr; capsule
    server &amp;rarr; managed host.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;h1&gt;Content view&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;code&gt;Content Views&lt;/code&gt; are subsets of content from the &lt;code&gt;Library&lt;/code&gt; (master copy of all contents).&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Multiple content views can be applied to one capsule server.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;code&gt;Content Views&lt;/code&gt; can be combined to create &lt;code&gt;Composite Content Views&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Composite view is just a grouping. Individual content view, once

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Positivity Project News:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Starting Monday, we will begin learning about integrity. This is
doing the right thing when nobody is watching. People with integrity
practice what they preach and maintain a consistent pattern of
behavior aligned with their values. They have the courage not to
follow the crowd if it means going against their beliefs. Integrity
is closely linked with the terms of honesty and authenticity. People
with integrity tell the truth and have alignment in their thoughts,
feelings, and behaviors.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Well said, isn't it?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Just came back from a long trip, I felt this piece described exactly
how I feel what China's current society lacks, integrity.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We had a red eye flight at 1:45am at Pudong airport. I was thinking
   to take the T line 9 &amp;rarr; line 2, which on map gets to Pudong at
   last stop. I also know there is a switch on line 2, four stops
   earlier than the airport stop, that everyone needs to get off the
   line 2 …&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;</description><dc:creator xmlns:dc="http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/">Feng Xia</dc:creator><pubDate>Mon, 09 Apr 2018 00:04:00 -0400</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">tag:fengxia41103.github.io,2018-04-09:/myblog/integrity.html</guid><category>thoughts</category><category>thoughts</category></item><item><title>Too little sympathy, too much generalization</title><link>https://fengxia41103.github.io/myblog/sympathy.html</link><description>&lt;figure class="col l6 m6 s12"&gt;

&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Noah is a taking social intelligence course. A conversation gets me
thinking, what is to measure a social intelligence? My observation of
kids (and adults, too) is that we need &lt;strong&gt;sympathy&lt;/strong&gt; &amp;mdash; the
feeling that your action will affect others in this or that way, and
the uncomfort the others display truly get to you so you feel bad
about it, too. It's hard, actually. How many times you curse the
ass-hole on the road who just speed by you without a slightest concern
what he does affects you one or another.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But, on the other hand, where to draw the line!? You can be doing
things while thinking about how others are going to feel &amp;larr; this
is just not practical, even the intention is certainly sound. I have
discussed this in great length in my &lt;a href="https://fengxia41103.github.io/myblog/hurt feelings.html"&gt;hurt feeling episode&lt;/a&gt;. Then
further down the line, there is broadly used generalization of,
everything! One post in our highschool wechat page is that Arizona

&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I have been building Django based web application for a while now. One
design/request I get often is a REST API. Once the model data is
exposed in REST, one can truly build a complete separate frontend
using things like Angular, react, and whatever you fancy. I have tried
a couple times myself following this architecture. On one hand it
gives a lot of flexibility and it looks nice, too &amp;larr; front end
technology is a lot of "{}", but it does look quite nice, and
responsive, too. But on the other, REST is a thing few understands
well except it is an API through which you can CRUD. Honestly, I don't
even understand yet how authentication is done, what is a good balance
between massaging data (in Tastypie's term, (de)-hydration) and
exposing data model raw.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Anyway, here I want to document a practice I use, a really rudimentary
one, of making django model available as REST resource through
Tastypie.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The past weekend was the big moving day. Things actually went pretty
well, except the morning pick up of U-Haul. What a terrible customer
service they had! Well, it started with my fault really by forgetting
to bring my driver license. Nonetheless, the only service was not
helpful &amp;larr; and it's just another example of &lt;a href="https://fengxia41103.github.io/myblog/euphemism.html"&gt;euphemism&lt;/a&gt; that
it gave an error message to retry during business hours of the
self-service pickup location (which was closed for Sunday, btw, wtf!),
and what it really meant, thanks for the last representative who
revealed it to me, was that my account was blocked for any further
self-service and my only option was to find a U-Haul location that was
open and have a real person to help me. Really, once again, euphemism
never works for anybody because &lt;strong&gt;it doesn't specify action to take to
move things forward!&lt;/strong&gt; Make it clear, as precise and actionable as
possible, so to remove and minimize lost in translation. An ambiguity
like that isn't a sign of politeness.

when I was just flipping through Youtube trying to find something to

before. I can't remember when now. I don't even recall its tune. But
when the music was played, it echoed inside me &amp;mdash; there were days
when I was walking on the bridge in 太原, thinking of the future and
Noah's mom, this tune was with me. At some point I actually thought it
was something quite beautiful and genuine and I wanted to write it
down before I forget. But now to think of it, it must have been there
all along since I watched the movie some time ago, just didn't surface
till this morning, or that day.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But the song made me think of you. I could feel it, could feel you

But what came to my mind this morning was
something quite peculiar, if not irrelevant to the scene &amp;mdash; what
is science, or being scientific? Noah is taking some &lt;em&gt;science&lt;/em&gt; class
on rock and mineral, and I have just written about
&lt;a href="https://fengxia41103.github.io/myblog/euphemism.html"&gt;euphemism&lt;/a&gt;. This word, science, has been lingering on my mind and
I wonder whether I'm telling Noah the right thing about it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So what is science? I always had this hunch that &lt;strong&gt;it certainly is not
truth&lt;/strong&gt; (but what is a truth, or anyone can possibly possess such
thing as truth? I doubt it, if not completly refuting it). So the next
closest thing is, fact!? Here is what &lt;a href="https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/science"&gt;webster&lt;/a&gt; says:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;the state of knowing : knowledge as distinguished from ignorance or misunderstanding&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So it has something to do with &lt;em&gt;knowledge&lt;/em&gt;. What is a knowledge?
&lt;a href="https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/fact"&gt;webster&lt;/a&gt; definition:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;(1) : the fact or condition of knowing something with familiarity gained through experience or association (2) : acquaintance with or understanding of a science, art, or technique

&lt;p&gt;Haven't been a while since I wrote you anything. I'm listening to this
movie while working, and felt I have something to say to you.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I want to say I'm sorry, sorry for being such a ass recently, for not
speaking to you much these days anymore, for checked out from our
family and am moving away. I'm sorry. I feel very very sad. I wanted
to be nice, but there is something stuck in my throat, that made me
not able to respond when you ask me question, when I should have said
things to you and Noah in a nice way, to be patient with him, and you,
and this family, and our situation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I'm sorry. I don't have those anymore. I lost patience, lost
willingness to save our marriage, lost courage to go through the thin
and thickness of life with you as I have promised. Up to recent week I

&lt;p&gt;Sigh. Life is indeed full of puzzling person and phenomenon that
annoys me and I found myself always wonder why they do that and what I
have done to make them act that way (or regardless what I have done
and do, they are just like that). Why?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The new house is coming together nicely. All the good decisions were
made and the outcome is really satisfying. Bill is a good guy. But
then, communication with him is just not there &amp;mdash; calling him
didn't usually feel welcomed, and calling me always starts 7is in the
morning (regardless the day of the week) and it's always when I needed
to pay him. How, one way, ish. After getting off that annoying phone
conversation with him, I was thinking that this is both entertaining
and annoying &amp;mdash; I thought I'm an angry old man. Well, here he is,
an even angri&lt;strong&gt;er&lt;/strong&gt; than I am &amp;mdash; funny, and rude. Oh well well,

the last few days, and have attempted to write a letter a few times,
but always not feeling the &lt;em&gt;feel&lt;/em&gt;, and when the feel was there I was
usually busy running around for things that is far less important but
more imminent. I think the actuality is that I don't know what to say
about it &amp;mdash; on the day I submitted the paperworks, stepping
outside the course house building, nice warm sunny peaceful almost
cheering urban scene with pedestrians walking by and a few hovering
around as if they had all the time in this world, I sat down on the
metal garden bench, felt, I don't know, relieved? not really. ease
that something on to-do list is finally done? yes, some. sad? yes,
some, too.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But yes, I felt sad. I felt I was letting people down, without knowing
what's laying ahead, and knowing I have broken a vow that I casted
sincerely, whole-heartedly, believed, wanted, proud of, but …&lt;/p&gt;</description><dc:creator xmlns:dc="http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/">Feng Xia</dc:creator><pubDate>Sun, 04 Feb 2018 09:30:00 -0500</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">tag:fengxia41103.github.io,2018-02-04:/myblog/the big D.html</guid><category>thoughts</category><category>thoughts</category><category>love</category></item><item><title>Class</title><link>https://fengxia41103.github.io/myblog/class.html</link><description>&lt;figure class="col s12"&gt;

&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I have to say, I haven't read an entertaining book as &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/Paul-Fussell-American-1983-10-16-Hardcover/dp/B0197PAO4U/ref=la_B000AQ6OIQ_1_17?s=books&amp;amp;ie=UTF8&amp;amp;qid=1517092280&amp;amp;sr=1-17&amp;amp;refinements=p_82%3AB000AQ6OIQ"&gt;Class&lt;/a&gt; for a
long time. This book is just stimulating, fun, and sharp. It actually
hurts. It describes sooo accurately of what I feel about many
aspects/signals in life that I come off with a much clearer idea of
what all these things are about and why they exist and behave in such
a way.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Super interesting. One thing for sure, Noah will be a middle-class
man, because I simply do not possess the attributes of the uppers,
thus having no ability to teach him that. Yet I truly wish he would
become one someday, not implying the fortune or the fame, but their
carefree of others' opinion, their accurate use of words in its
essence and intent, their blunt expression without ambiguity, and
their dismiss of artifacts created without practical purpose.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is brilliant! Really. I have been agonized by proliferating use
of adjectives both in my own language and others for a while (even
this exact sentence is full of adjectives …&lt;/p&gt;</description><dc:creator xmlns:dc="http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/">Feng Xia</dc:creator><pubDate>Sat, 27 Jan 2018 17:30:00 -0500</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">tag:fengxia41103.github.io,2018-01-27:/myblog/class.html</guid><category>thoughts</category><category>thoughts</category></item><item><title>Society</title><link>https://fengxia41103.github.io/myblog/society.html</link><description>&lt;figure class="col l6 m6 s12"&gt;

&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I  have   been  doing  a   lot  of  thinking  recently,   about  human
society. There are multiple themes in my life and in my thinkings that
I find them interesting, disturbing, annoying, and saddening. The more
books  I'm reading  about  historical  events and  views,  the more  I
question how a  society, or any society, can survive  and develop, and
whether there  is a  pattern (or  lesson to  learn from)  that propels
their initiation, growth, and declination?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I don't know. Human society is messy. That's the only word I can think
of. Listening to NPR makes this  feeling stronger all the time &amp;mdash;
I  actually  feel sorry  for  government  officials, politicians,  and
advocates who are  either in a position to &lt;em&gt;serve&lt;/em&gt;  the people, and to
help  &lt;em&gt;all&lt;/em&gt;. It's  an illusion  that, in  my opinion,  both wrong  and
impossible. I'm not sure how much they really believe in what they are
saying and preaching, and they are set out to do. Chances are, I would
dare to bet, they are feeling  the conflicts within themselves all the
time, that they …&lt;/p&gt;</description><dc:creator xmlns:dc="http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/">Feng Xia</dc:creator><pubDate>Tue, 23 Jan 2018 11:50:00 -0500</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">tag:fengxia41103.github.io,2018-01-23:/myblog/society.html</guid><category>thoughts</category><category>thoughts</category></item><item><title>Remembering China</title><link>https://fengxia41103.github.io/myblog/remembering%20china.html</link><description>&lt;figure class="col l6 m6 s12"&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is a quite fascinating &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/Remembering-China-1935-1945-MVP-Exner/dp/0898231701"&gt;book&lt;/a&gt;. Actually I started to find
myself always fascinated by early first-person account of China. I
have this curiosity of what this country was like, and everytime I
read a book like I always found myself keep thinking how similar
peopel then to people now, and how unchanged this place has been. This
actually bothers me because I think I am being biased against them,
that I have already drawn a conclusion and am therefore seeing
evidence (and seeking evidence in haystack) everywhere.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The conversation between Bea and her Russian pupil is just funny:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Speaking of saving for a rainy day, one of my Russians met that
expression in his reading the other day, and wanted to know what it
meant. I said he might be sick and need money for doctor or
hospital.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"But doctors and hospitals are free."&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"You might want to save to send your child to college."&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"But all education is free."&lt;/p&gt;

  many do you have left?

&lt;p&gt;This thought has been haunting me for a while now since I was
listenning to 罗辑思维 while in Shanghai in 2016. I really enjoyed the
talks to the point that siqi joked that 罗辑 was becoming my
idol. Well, that certainly was not happening and would never happen
&amp;mdash; I enjoyed it because of the new information of history which I
was both familiar with and strange of, partially derived from my
deficient formal and self- education on these topics, partially
because I never thought of them this way. Nonetheless, I found topics
intriguing and fun and had some really good point &amp;mdash; the analogy
of training passing by a platform as he described how progress of AI
will pass human advantages.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But anyway, I disliked tremendously when …&lt;/p&gt;</description><dc:creator xmlns:dc="http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/">Feng Xia</dc:creator><pubDate>Thu, 18 Jan 2018 21:30:00 -0500</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">tag:fengxia41103.github.io,2018-01-18:/myblog/reader digest life.html</guid><category>thoughts</category><category>thoughts</category></item><item><title>Best yoda lines</title><link>https://fengxia41103.github.io/myblog/best%20yoda%20line.html</link><description>&lt;p&gt;Noah wrote a sheet he titled &lt;code&gt;best yoda line from the clone
war&lt;/code&gt;. It's both philisophical, sophisticated, and cute. He has also
said quite a few things recently that shocked me.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;Episode 1: taking a trip&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Me: do you want to go on a trip with me?
Noah: No (firmly)
Me: (surprised) why not!? You don't want to take a trip with me?
Noah: No I don't (firmly)
Me: (huh) why don't you then?
Noah: cause 我不想怒你
Me: ....&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;Episode 2: fuss&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On the way driving back from a bookstore on a cold winter weekend (and
he was coughing and wheezing a bit over the weekend so something was
looming). So I proposed to stop by Lake Johnson for walk (and to kill
time), and his origami yoda said "No" (and we in the end lost the
origami yoda, which made him really upset ~~). &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Me: let's go to Lake Johnson
Noah: No, my origami yoda says No
Me: but but, I want to go Lake Johnson
Noah: (pause) fine, we can go …&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;</description><dc:creator xmlns:dc="http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/">Feng Xia</dc:creator><pubDate>Wed, 17 Jan 2018 11:30:00 -0500</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">tag:fengxia41103.github.io,2018-01-17:/myblog/best yoda line.html</guid><category>thoughts</category><category>thoughts</category></item><item><title>A minor upset</title><link>https://fengxia41103.github.io/myblog/grownup%20kid.html</link><description>&lt;figure class="col l6 m6 s12"&gt;
  &lt;img src="images/funny/interview.png"/&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I think, well, actually not that I think, I feel, I feel it with me,
that I have grown very much impatient with Noah's mom now. This is
really sad. I think there is something up to her life recently, too
&amp;mdash; she was not being patient with Noah, actually I would say
&lt;em&gt;less patient&lt;/em&gt; with him than I do these days even. I don't know. It
could be just a period, but then, it's not like her.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Then, I got a phone call from our contractor asking about the vanity
doors. Honestly I haven't seen them much since they were removed, and
have little idea where they are. Yet, just from the conversation I
picked up from her this weekend, I had a faint idea of what happened
to it, and of course, a phone call verified the hunch.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This makes me wonder, why so? and does it matter at all? and why do I
get upset? First of all, the matter is such a minor case that it
doesn't lend itself to a reason …&lt;/p&gt;</description><dc:creator xmlns:dc="http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/">Feng Xia</dc:creator><pubDate>Tue, 09 Jan 2018 09:55:00 -0500</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">tag:fengxia41103.github.io,2018-01-09:/myblog/grownup kid.html</guid><category>thoughts</category><category>thoughts</category></item><item><title>Age and maturity</title><link>https://fengxia41103.github.io/myblog/age%20and%20maturity.html</link><description>&lt;figure class="col l6 m6 s12"&gt;

&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I admire youth. It is a wonderful treasure to have since there is
nothing you did to have it, and nothing you can do to retain it. You
have it when you have it, then it's gone. But youth is also an awful
curse since you are cast into a spell of &lt;strong&gt;hope&lt;/strong&gt;, which is often
viewed as a bless, the last straw Gods put into the Pandora's box so
to save human from drowning from the evil of chance (but can also be
viewed as an evil. go figure.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It's admirable to quote classics and such so support a view you have
as if these classics add much credibility and value to your
opinion. Yet, I would have to argue that the same statement made by
these &lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eA7rKZbF_RI&amp;amp;index=1&amp;amp;list=PLATwx1z00HseXmeCbjbJRkaVO3088hC_A"&gt;老男人 on this show&lt;/a&gt; bears sophistication that the junior
speaker in his 30s is unlikely to follow and understand &amp;mdash; it's
cruel (and amusing) to watch the tease, but fundamentally I feel sad
that myself has reached the age to appreciate these remarks, and found
life …&lt;/p&gt;</description><dc:creator xmlns:dc="http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/">Feng Xia</dc:creator><pubDate>Sun, 07 Jan 2018 12:33:00 -0500</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">tag:fengxia41103.github.io,2018-01-07:/myblog/age and maturity.html</guid><category>thoughts</category><category>thoughts</category></item><item><title>Half the world</title><link>https://fengxia41103.github.io/myblog/half%20the%20world.html</link><description>&lt;figure class="col l6 m6 s12"&gt;
  &lt;img src="images/e13-857.jpg"/&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Indeed a fascinating book, &lt;a href="https://www.gutenberg.org/files/29546/29546-h/29546-h.htm"&gt;Where half the world is waking up&lt;/a&gt; by
[Clarence Poe], a person born in North Carolina writing about China,
Japan, Korea and India in the year of 1911. What a view he had!?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Certainly I got to learn about what these countries were like &amp;mdash;
more backwards than I have thought, have been taught to believe, and
have ever imagined. It was not the West bullying because they love to
bully; it was the East being relatively too weak, so in a &lt;em&gt;simplified&lt;/em&gt;
game of world dynamics with only two contestants, the West &amp;amp; the East,
the winner went to the West (as we conventionally call though I'm also
reading &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/Why-West-Rules-Now-Patterns/dp/0312611692"&gt;another book&lt;/a&gt;, in which the author spent pages to
articulate and hoped to define the term "East vs. West" &amp;rarr;
therefore, the convention wisdom of the two terms are not nearly as
clear as one assumes. On the contrary, they are such a broad brush in
a social, historical, even geographical context that the line between
them are completly blurred and up for interpretation …&lt;/p&gt;</description><dc:creator xmlns:dc="http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/">Feng Xia</dc:creator><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 2018 18:30:00 -0500</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">tag:fengxia41103.github.io,2018-01-01:/myblog/half the world.html</guid><category>thoughts</category><category>thoughts</category></item><item><title>Mind</title><link>https://fengxia41103.github.io/myblog/mind.html</link><description>&lt;figure class="col s12"&gt;

&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Got a book and it is truly disturbing, &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/Rape-Mind-Psychology-Menticide-Brainwashing/dp/1614277877"&gt;Rape of the Mind&lt;/a&gt;. So the
mind manipulation has been developed to the point that is highly
refined, highly &lt;code&gt;scientific&lt;/code&gt; (you know I always have reserve about
this particular word this days), highly systematic, and highly
predictable. And this is the really disturbing. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Like how I have analyzed my line of work, psychology has developed
framework and divided torture into phases that can be systematically
entered through means of physical torture, drug, mental confusion and
such. Therefore, all the brutality of torturing on the body isn't just
a pain to bear or to yield, but just one step towards a goal that the
initiator has a clear definition &amp;mdash; in other words, he knows what
he is doing, the question is, if you are the one being tortured, do
you know what he is doing to you!?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Scary, isn't it!? Part of the book will be talking about mind
manipulation on the mass, which I have always wondered about. The
recent movie 芳华 made the talk of …&lt;/p&gt;</description><dc:creator xmlns:dc="http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/">Feng Xia</dc:creator><pubDate>Sun, 24 Dec 2017 16:30:00 -0500</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">tag:fengxia41103.github.io,2017-12-24:/myblog/mind.html</guid><category>thoughts</category><category>thoughts</category></item><item><title>Logic</title><link>https://fengxia41103.github.io/myblog/logic.html</link><description>&lt;figure class="col l5 m5 s12"&gt;

&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It amazes me, really, that how many people are conflicting themselves
in term of logic in their arguments. Or I should say, everyone,
including myself, are constantly in a state of contradicting of
ourselves when it comes to explain an opinion or in a discussion to
win a debate. How so?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So the big news of China's financial world is that Baidu is opening up
some kind of online version of a traditional bank, and everybody
thinks it is going to rock the money industry because now it has
officially married the crown jewel of this era &amp;mdash; computer
technology. Of course, the marriage carries an army of buzz word
ornaments &amp;mdash; AI, big data... the scenario is that by collecting
consumer data and data crunching, agent shall be able to &lt;strong&gt;improve
efficiency&lt;/strong&gt; dramatically in deciding whether one should get a loan
approval or not, which, if realized as what they say, is certainly a
huge advantage over the status quo &amp;mdash; Chinese state-owned banks
are notorious in treating their customers badly by being low efficient
and arrogant …&lt;/p&gt;</description><dc:creator xmlns:dc="http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/">Feng Xia</dc:creator><pubDate>Tue, 19 Dec 2017 08:50:00 -0500</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">tag:fengxia41103.github.io,2017-12-19:/myblog/logic.html</guid><category>thoughts</category><category>thoughts</category></item><item><title>Hurt feelings</title><link>https://fengxia41103.github.io/myblog/hurt%20feelings.html</link><description>&lt;figure class="col s12"&gt;
  &lt;img src="images/stock-photo-14009067.jpg"/&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is a tough one, really, cause I have been puzzled by this topic
for the last five years, and am continuing being puzzled by it without
a resolution. I don't know how to resolve this. But it is definitely
an &lt;strong&gt;issue&lt;/strong&gt; of me that I need to understand, to fix (if it can be),
and to do better without this.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here is the situation: someone close to you said she was hurt, by you,
maybe a remark, a move, something. And here is the dilemma. On the one
hand, I think no one can control how another person feels, therefore
it is simply not sensible to project the result of the perception
&amp;mdash; you may make the perfect conversation with a golden heart,
there is simply nothing stop it being perceived as a vicious attack
with a dark intention. So, does this make it completly unrelated
between your behavior and others' reactions? In other words, if each
is responsible for his/her own feelings, do I just get a jail-free
card to be a jerk …&lt;/p&gt;</description><dc:creator xmlns:dc="http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/">Feng Xia</dc:creator><pubDate>Mon, 11 Dec 2017 21:30:00 -0500</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">tag:fengxia41103.github.io,2017-12-11:/myblog/hurt feelings.html</guid><category>thoughts</category><category>thoughts</category></item><item><title>Love, life</title><link>https://fengxia41103.github.io/myblog/love%20life.html</link><description>&lt;figure&gt;

&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I'm in the middle of this mid-life crisis, I guess, which prompted me
to think a lot about why I am feeling this, whether this is happening
for a reason, that it is just unique to me, or to everyone in a way,
just different content? If it's the latter, then it's just like a
phase in growing up, that sooner or later one will experience it
&amp;rarr; it's the process driven by nature, not by my mind, which I
always fear is going crazy, sometimes. I mean, being unique is what
everybody wants, but being unique is also what gives you anxiety
&amp;mdash; you want to be part of a social team (so you don't feel left
out), but you also want to be standing out, uniquely you, being taken
that way, that you are someone &lt;strong&gt;special&lt;/strong&gt;. How conflicting! This is
like everything else in life, that two sides of a coin are fighting
but must co-exist, all the time, and inside one body, one brain, one
person!

on tap with China's economic progress and debates, is nowadays plagued

electric cars. What bugs me is the fact that no one, I mean no one, on
the show and involved in this discussion said anything about
&lt;strong&gt;efficiency&lt;/strong&gt; of energy conversion. They all stated the easy
&lt;em&gt;opinions&lt;/em&gt;, environment protection, green life, obsoleting old
technology (and really!? who said, or proved, that gasoline car is an

free finance API is &lt;a href="https://forums.yahoo.net/t5/Yahoo-Finance-help/Is-Yahoo-Finance-API-broken/td-p/250503"&gt;gone!&lt;/a&gt;, no more. This is quite a bummer. How
to get daily quotes so to reestablish the data stream? Well, as a the
beauty of free market, someone is always up to the service if there is
a demand. So I ended up using &lt;a href="https://www.alphavantage.co/documentation/"&gt;Alpha Advantage API&lt;/a&gt; for a change.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Tagging on top the &lt;a href="https://fengxia41103.github.io/myblog/data visualization.html"&gt;World Snapshot&lt;/a&gt; project, this one is
essentially a graph browser that takes the API data stream based on
user selected company symbol, and draw all the data index on a single page.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;

&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The &lt;code&gt;architecture&lt;/code&gt;/&lt;code&gt;design&lt;/code&gt; is shown below, and &lt;a href="https://github.com/fengxia41103/sp500"&gt;github code&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This notion of &lt;em&gt;技术已经很成熟&lt;/em&gt; (it is a &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mature_technology"&gt;mature technology&lt;/a&gt;?  a
well known technology? huh? I don't even know how to translate this
line.)  bothers me a LOT! What do you mean by that? There are loads
questions to be clarified, don't you think!?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;that the technology has already been developed? &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;that can be easily copied and re-implemented, with the same wonderful results?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;or has been in existence for a while and everybody in the room
understands what it means, and what it takes!? &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Are we talking about the principle of this technology here? or a
  version of implementation? &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;or some other customized idea based on it? &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;and how do you know it works for you in your application context?
  Have you done a POC? and to what degree your POC was built and
  tested and proven to give you confidence? How far apart is your POC
  from what you envision of the &lt;strong&gt;real&lt;/strong&gt; thing? How did you derive
  that conclusioin?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Really, whenever ppl use such a &lt;strong&gt;vain, vague, meaningless …&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</description><dc:creator xmlns:dc="http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/">Feng Xia</dc:creator><pubDate>Wed, 08 Nov 2017 14:30:00 -0500</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">tag:fengxia41103.github.io,2017-11-08:/myblog/mature tech.html</guid><category>thoughts</category><category>thoughts</category></item><item><title>History</title><link>https://fengxia41103.github.io/myblog/history.html</link><description>&lt;figure class="col l6 m8 s12"&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Reading &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/Rape-Nile-Robbers-Tourists-Archaeologists/dp/0813340616"&gt;The rape of the Nile&lt;/a&gt;, quite a fascinating book.
It's rather surprising how recent these events were &amp;mdash;
we are talking about the mid-19th century, what, about 150 years ago?
In prospective, the history of Egypt and its glorious monuments have
been around for much longer than that.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;reality of the past&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What really bothers me, however, is how the people at those days were
treating these ancient artifacts back then &amp;mdash; just like the
horror propaganda I have been told about China's treasure being looted
and trashed by barbarians of both foreign and domestic origin (and
admittedly much more by the domestic ones), the same theme of sadness
was playing in Egypt, over and over and over again. Pyramids were used
for quarrying building materials, and artifacts were given as a token
to influential whoever the ruler was trying to please. At the end of
the day, no one was looking at them as arts of unreplaceable
value. They were free gifts left over by ancient anonymous &amp;mdash;
cheap as dirt, and only meaningful to one …&lt;/p&gt;</description><dc:creator xmlns:dc="http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/">Feng Xia</dc:creator><pubDate>Fri, 03 Nov 2017 11:12:00 -0400</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">tag:fengxia41103.github.io,2017-11-03:/myblog/history.html</guid><category>thoughts</category><category>thoughts</category></item><item><title>Slow down</title><link>https://fengxia41103.github.io/myblog/slow%20down.html</link><description>&lt;figure class="col l3 m4 s12"&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Have you had this experience, that something you are familiar with,
suddenly slowed down, which made you feel that everything was in a
slow motion? &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I know, it sounds pretty strange, and it is indeed strange. On the way
to work this morning I was listening to
my &lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1s4YQqnbnM8"&gt;all time favourate movie&lt;/a&gt;, and for some reason I was playing it
in a 1.5x slower speed than normal, and how strange it all sounded!
The speech, the music, the vibes, all slowed down just a bit! I could
still tell the voices, plots, not like that the voice was changed to
some low tone when you play the records really really slowly. No. They
were pretty much intact, but you could sense the pace of it felt,
different.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It was quite an interesting experience. Then, cars going by. I suppose
they were driving in their normal speed, even they felt, slowed down
&amp;mdash; the drivers were not &lt;em&gt;as aggressive as usual&lt;/em&gt;, and the whole
rythm of life was on a slow track of some sort.

LXD container to bootstrap a Juju controller. 
But how to access the Juju GUI? Launching it is easy
enough with &lt;code&gt;$ juju gui&lt;/code&gt; from juju host; 
accessing it from anywhere outside
the host is a challenge. One way is through &lt;code&gt;$ ssh -X&lt;/code&gt; to 
the LXD and launch firefox. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Another option is to use &lt;a href="https://www.nginx.com/resources/admin-guide/reverse-proxy/"&gt;&lt;code&gt;nginx&lt;/code&gt; to proxy&lt;/a&gt; the GUI service. The
quirk here is to enable &lt;code&gt;ssl&lt;/code&gt; proxy (notice the &lt;code&gt;https&lt;/code&gt;?)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;figure class="col s12 center"&gt;
  &lt;img src="images/juju%20gui%20nginx.png"/&gt;
  &lt;figcaption&gt;Juju GUI with Nginx proxy&lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Get SSL cert in &lt;code&gt;/etc/nginx&lt;/code&gt;. This will create two files in this
   directory: &lt;code&gt;cert.key&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;cert.crt&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="highlight"&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;code&gt;```shell
$ sudo openssl req -x509 -nodes -days 365 -newkey rsa:2048 -keyout /etc/nginx/cert.key -out /etc/nginx/cert.crt
```
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In LXD host, use &lt;code&gt;$ juju gui&lt;/code&gt; to find out its server address and
   port, for example:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="highlight"&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class="err"&gt;```&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;shell&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;dev&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;fengxia&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nv"&gt;@ubuntu&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="err"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;~&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="err"&gt;$&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;juju&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;gui&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="n"&gt;GUI&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="mf"&gt;2.10.2&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="k"&gt;for&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;model&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="ss"&gt;&amp;quot;admin/default&amp;quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="k"&gt;is&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;enabled&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="k"&gt;at&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="err"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Have you ever been caught in a mode that you just feel the whole life
is collapsing, not necessarily things are really bad, just that you
feel the mind is on a edge pissed off by something at that moment that
you just want to get out, to scream, to even kill somebody!? You will
be like &lt;strong&gt;wtf&lt;/strong&gt; let's just bring it on, sink me to the bottom of
whatever life has it for me, trash me to the ground, and better just
kill me so I won't bounce back up again to suffer more by dragging it
on and on and on.....&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That's exactly how I feel right now, today! WTF! really? How could
this be soooo damn hard? I just want to move on my life, and here it
is, somehow, somewhere, some dark energy in this universe just want to
anchor me right back to where I am. And seriously, if only there is an
archor in my life, in my mind, wouldn't I have taken this step in the
first place …&lt;/p&gt;</description><dc:creator xmlns:dc="http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/">Feng Xia</dc:creator><pubDate>Thu, 12 Oct 2017 11:10:00 -0400</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">tag:fengxia41103.github.io,2017-10-12:/myblog/bad day.html</guid><category>thoughts</category><category>thoughts</category></item><item><title>KVM</title><link>https://fengxia41103.github.io/myblog/kvm.html</link><description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kernel-based_Virtual_Machine"&gt;KVM&lt;/a&gt; is something new to me, and it sounds awesome. The experience
I want to have is a local dev that I can copy &amp;amp; paste from some base
image in case I forgot to take a snapshot at milestone. This way I
feel comfortable to stand up a sandbox, try out crazy things, then
discard it entirely at done, and repeat. So this means something
minimal, fast.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;First thing first, get &lt;code&gt;kvm&lt;/code&gt; and a few tools:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="highlight"&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;code&gt;$&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;apt&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;kvm&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;libvirt-bin&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;bridge-utils&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;cloud-utils&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;cloud-init&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;libguestfs-tools
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;h1&gt;Cloud image&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Don't bother with full blown &lt;code&gt;.iso&lt;/code&gt;, use cloud images,
eg. &lt;a href="https://cloud-images.ubuntu.com/releases/16.04/release/"&gt;xenial 16.04&lt;/a&gt;, my de faco at writing. It's &amp;lt; 300M
and boots fast. Key to know at this point is the file format &amp;larr;
use &lt;code&gt;qemu-img info [.img]&lt;/code&gt; for &lt;code&gt;file format:&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="highlight"&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;code&gt;$&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;wget&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;[&lt;/span&gt;.img&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;url&lt;span class="o"&gt;]&lt;/span&gt;

To&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;get&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;file&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;format:
$&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;qemu-img&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;info&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;[&lt;/span&gt;.img&lt;span class="o"&gt;]&lt;/span&gt;
---------------------

file&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;format:&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;qcow2

cluster_size:&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="m"&gt;65536&lt;/span&gt;
Format&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;specific&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;information:

&lt;p&gt;I'm obsessed by &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/La_La_Land_(film)"&gt;La la land&lt;/a&gt;. How many times have I watched and
listened to this film? I'm playing it everyday now at work as it is
also the only movie I loaded on this computer. While I was doing it, I
was thinking what I would like to hear when I need a little sound, and
it was the only one I wanted then.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Got curious of its reviews, I know, I haven't read any of others'
reviews of it till now. But honestly, like the guy in the film, why do
I care what other people say about it, if myself enjoys it already?
Who the hell care what they say? So what surprised me, as well as
impressed me, was that it was done with 30 million dollars, and the
director's first film, &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Whiplash_(2014_film)"&gt;Whipsplash&lt;/a&gt;, was done in 3. What am I
trying to say? is that whenever I was hearing the piano theme of La la
land, I felt deeply moved as if the sweet and bitter memory came into
life, dancing …&lt;/p&gt;</description><dc:creator xmlns:dc="http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/">Feng Xia</dc:creator><pubDate>Sat, 07 Oct 2017 11:00:00 -0400</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">tag:fengxia41103.github.io,2017-10-07:/myblog/art is better.html</guid><category>thoughts</category><category>thoughts</category></item><item><title>Linux laptop</title><link>https://fengxia41103.github.io/myblog/linux%20laptop.html</link><description>&lt;p&gt;Instructions to get Ubuntu Xenial &amp;amp; Bionic (or any Linux) as your laptop OS.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;Install Linux&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You can do a dual boot or just wipe the whole disk. Window's boot
manager will interfere, somehow, which I don't remember the details
anymore. Google it. Eventually it will work. The rest assumes you have
Linux installed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Also, follow &lt;a href="https://fengxia41103.github.io/myblog/emacs.html"&gt;these steps&lt;/a&gt; to get your Linux in a good shape.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;VPN&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Most importantly, you need VPN.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Go to &lt;code&gt;otp.company.com&lt;/code&gt; to register your phone number.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Install &lt;code&gt;Company OTP&lt;/code&gt; from your app store.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Keep &lt;code&gt;Company OTP&lt;/code&gt; app running so you can see the active OTP.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;code&gt;apt install openconnect screen tmux&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In a screen, &lt;code&gt;sudo openconnect -u [username] webvpn.us.company.com&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;first password: your regular domain login pwd&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;second one: OTP&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If works, you should see something like this:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Browsing wechat friend posts, and one image, as common as it actually
is, the &lt;strong&gt;never say no&lt;/strong&gt; type of moral pump, suddenly got me thinking.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I used to think the &lt;em&gt;can do&lt;/em&gt; attitude is so positive, energetic,
optimistic, worth holding on, worth broadcasting, worth preaching,
worth teaching, worth affecting everyone around me. After all, wasn't
that my motto and I tried to teach Noah that, too, that the &lt;em&gt;never
give up&lt;/em&gt; spirit? But when it is used &lt;em&gt;broadly&lt;/em&gt;
within a context just about anything you can think of, in job, in life,
it feels so, vain, so going into a battle while disregarding the odds
in reality. What about cut loss and run?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Why never say no!? How do you know the condition permits you to say
yes? shouldn't we just quit, sometimes, when our judgement tells us
it's not a good idea to go forward? Like yesterday when Noah and I
played openra and the rush AI just threw at me an army of artileries 
while my defense was not up to hold on …&lt;/p&gt;</description><dc:creator xmlns:dc="http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/">Feng Xia</dc:creator><pubDate>Thu, 28 Sep 2017 12:58:00 -0400</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">tag:fengxia41103.github.io,2017-09-28:/myblog/say no.html</guid><category>thoughts</category><category>thoughts</category></item><item><title>China's Nationalism</title><link>https://fengxia41103.github.io/myblog/china%20nationalism.html</link><description>&lt;figure class="col l6 m6 s12"&gt;
  &lt;img src="images/funny/glory.jpg"/&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;What is a &lt;a href="https://www.wikiwand.com/en/Nationalism"&gt;nationalism&lt;/a&gt;? Is it a bad thing, or a good thing? The
word always reminds me the dawn of WWII that Japan empire was, in my
history education, powered by its fanatic nationalism spirits to
conquer the world and to bring prosperity to its &lt;em&gt;new lands&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What made me think of this word, however, is something that
parallels this feeling, and I don't know yet how to put it
&amp;mdash; China's 大国崛起, its ambition to reestablish its past glory
(presumably existed in history, which I actually have a quite
different opinion), which in many cases involves two themes &amp;mdash; to
get a campus of followers (surrounding neighbours), and to live a life
of the good, old times.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But, this is really troublesome, to me. First of all, the glory of
leadership is a terrible thought. This is consistent of the
hierarchical structure you see everywhere China that somehow someone
must be the &lt;em&gt;boss&lt;/em&gt; while everyone else around him/her will be
obedient. Not only this is a social dynamics leading to rigid …&lt;/p&gt;</description><dc:creator xmlns:dc="http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/">Feng Xia</dc:creator><pubDate>Fri, 15 Sep 2017 07:11:00 -0400</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">tag:fengxia41103.github.io,2017-09-15:/myblog/china nationalism.html</guid><category>thoughts</category><category>thoughts</category></item><item><title>Juju local LXD</title><link>https://fengxia41103.github.io/myblog/juju%20local%20LXD.html</link><description>&lt;p&gt;Using Juju's &lt;a href="https://jujucharms.com/docs/2.0/clouds-LXD"&gt;LXD provider&lt;/a&gt; is the least-hassle way to start an
experience of Juju and its charms. However, if you have done charm
development for a while, you know making a one line of code change,
deploying charm, then wait to see the &lt;em&gt;new&lt;/em&gt; code got executed &amp;larr;
it's good 5-10 minutes per cycle. These add up quickly when you are in
the middle of churning out code to get your ideas written. Not to
mention creating a new &lt;code&gt;machine&lt;/code&gt; is 2x slower, and bootstraping a new
controller is even worse. I had experience in Shanghai sitting 30+
minutes for a new controller due to the location's unreliable
connections, and sometimes it just failed w/ a timeout. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What to do? The goal is to create a way to reduce this trial-error
cycle as much as possible so to speed up code development.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;Challenge&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you watch &lt;code&gt;juju debug-log&lt;/code&gt; while it deploys a charm, you start to
realize that there are roughly seven steps:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;creating a container (will discuss &lt;code&gt;--to&lt;/code&gt; switch later)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;update/upgrade the new container …&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;</description><dc:creator xmlns:dc="http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/">Feng Xia</dc:creator><pubDate>Wed, 06 Sep 2017 13:21:00 -0400</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">tag:fengxia41103.github.io,2017-09-06:/myblog/juju local LXD.html</guid><category>openstack</category><category>lenovo</category></item><item><title>sharing economy</title><link>https://fengxia41103.github.io/myblog/sharing%20economy.html</link><description>&lt;figure class="col l4 m4 s12"&gt;

&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.wikiwand.com/en/Sharing_economy"&gt;Sharing economy&lt;/a&gt; is hot. Looking around, one can't help feeling
just about everything can be shared. But then, you can't help asking
yourself, "where does it end?"&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Really, so cars can be shared, houses can be shared, &lt;a href="http://www.scmp.com/news/china/society/article/2106688/shared-folding-stool-service-launched-beijing-over-half-go"&gt;stools&lt;/a&gt; can
be shared, &lt;a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2017/07/18/bike-sharing-boom-in-china-pedals-to-new-heights.html"&gt;bikes&lt;/a&gt; can be shared... so what can not be? Practically
nothing. I think the generalization roots in the word &lt;strong&gt;share&lt;/strong&gt; as
itself really doesn't rule out all the confusions out there &amp;mdash;
are bike sharing really "sharing"? or are they just a leasing in
disguise? what makes you think one way or the other? what is sharing?
I told Noah to share his toys, but to think of it, he didn't
necessarily own the toys (for example, when he was in preschool), so
the &lt;strong&gt;sharing&lt;/strong&gt; was really an intention, a spiritual openness with
benefiting others in mind. Since he is a kid, sharing toys is
encouraged; but what if he is an adult and I'm encouraging him to
share something that doesn't even belong to him at the first place?
What's the message then? What …&lt;/p&gt;</description><dc:creator xmlns:dc="http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/">Feng Xia</dc:creator><pubDate>Thu, 31 Aug 2017 20:21:00 -0400</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">tag:fengxia41103.github.io,2017-08-31:/myblog/sharing economy.html</guid><category>thoughts</category><category>thoughts</category></item><item><title>People psyche</title><link>https://fengxia41103.github.io/myblog/people%20psyche.html</link><description>&lt;figure class="col l4 m4 s12"&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Have you observed something that ppl do, and you just wonder &lt;em&gt;what the
hell&lt;/em&gt;*? Yes, I find human behavior very puzzling. Maybe it's just me
that is not connected with surroundings and felt isolated. But
seriously, there are just these things that ppl do that I can't help
thinking the word &lt;code&gt;irrational&lt;/code&gt; is too polite to describe.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;These days, nothing annoys me more than the morning rush and
aggressive drivers.  So I was driving to work seven o'clock in the
morning in my little Prius C which can only go that fast on the road
anyway, and boy, cars were just tailgating, then got impatience, swing
to the next lane, bypassing me as if running from a disease, there
might even be some dirty look involved and a few curses like &lt;code&gt;asian
guy just doesn't know how to drive&lt;/code&gt; that type of thing. But
seriously!? &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;First of all, there are like a million cars right in front of me, and
they are all driving more or less in the same speed, so
bypassing me at …&lt;/p&gt;</description><dc:creator xmlns:dc="http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/">Feng Xia</dc:creator><pubDate>Wed, 23 Aug 2017 12:21:00 -0400</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">tag:fengxia41103.github.io,2017-08-23:/myblog/people psyche.html</guid><category>thoughts</category><category>thoughts</category></item><item><title>Modern slavery</title><link>https://fengxia41103.github.io/myblog/modern%20slavery.html</link><description>&lt;figure class="col l6 m6 s12"&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I'm convinced now that the number one problem I am annoyed by the
modern Chinese culture is that it create self-contradictory
person. They speak in logics however they see fit without being aware
of that two points coming out of their mouth are actually
contradictory. Take it further, they took a one-sided view of history
in such a self-confidence that they completly fail to realize that what
they are bragging and broadcasting are exactly the same thing in
history they vow to be a terrible deed by any measure.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;Trade&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A case in point is the popular place such as the &lt;a href="http://www.baike.com/wiki/%E5%A5%B6%E5%A5%B6%E5%BA%99"&gt;奶奶庙&lt;/a&gt;. I think
the debate of it in the context of pop art or even pioneer art is
completly a walk-around. Can people idol these objects? of
course. Can they bring peace and love? Doesn't matter, and to some,
yes, so be it. Are they arts? Yes. Are they art I like? No. Should I
respect its right to be there? Yes, as long as I don't go there, and
it doesn't …&lt;/p&gt;</description><dc:creator xmlns:dc="http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/">Feng Xia</dc:creator><pubDate>Sat, 12 Aug 2017 16:27:00 -0400</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">tag:fengxia41103.github.io,2017-08-12:/myblog/modern slavery.html</guid><category>thoughts</category><category>thoughts</category></item><item><title>Art, a thought</title><link>https://fengxia41103.github.io/myblog/art%20a%20thought.html</link><description>&lt;figure class="col l6 m6 s12"&gt;

&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Finished reading Kenneth Clark's &lt;a href="https://www.wikiwand.com/en/Civilisation_(TV_series)"&gt;Civilisation&lt;/a&gt;. I can't say I
actually understand the book, because nearly every item he was talking
about and describing with passion and logic, I had little idea. I
barely recognized some names, and very little of the
artifacts. Sculptures, some; paintings, nearly none; background
history and social context, zero. Even the wordings he used were
elusive to me, because it felt &lt;em&gt;discrete&lt;/em&gt; in a sense of continuity of
meaning &amp;mdash; I could recognize most of the words, then never saw
the pattern that this word is connected with that word in a sentence,
and had no idea what this combination means!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;Art?&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Alas! This is terrible. Here I am, reading a classic on
&lt;strong&gt;civilisation&lt;/strong&gt;, yet I do not understand a thing! On the back of my
mind I was thinking, isn't this the same feeling of ignorance and
disconnect when foreigner looks at Chinese arts? and what about the
most recent news of &lt;a href="http://www.baike.com/wiki/%E5%A5%B6%E5%A5%B6%E5%BA%99"&gt;奶奶庙&lt;/a&gt;, that people are debating whether

&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Listening to &lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6DsteIjyZZs"&gt;this talk&lt;/a&gt; this morning, the thought hit me. How do
you look at this &lt;a href="https://www.wikiwand.com/en/King_of_Glory"&gt;game&lt;/a&gt;?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Games, in my humble opinion, are just, bad. I know it's unfair to say
so since I have grown out of that addiction phase, and every boy/man
will go through that sometime in their life, inevitably. I don't know
the psyche or chemistry or bio-trigger behind this phenomenon. There
must be reason, especially a chemical reason. Brain likes it not
because it feels good, because there is a chemical stuff that equals
&lt;strong&gt;feeling good&lt;/strong&gt; &amp;mdash; just the same stuff in different outfit,
&lt;em&gt;gamble = sex&lt;/em&gt; that kind of high.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But what bothers me is this. When the entire Chinese population is so
trenched in their &lt;strong&gt;moral high ground&lt;/strong&gt; through education (which
myself is a victim, too) that the recent history of humiliation
started with &lt;a href="https://www.wikiwand.com/en/Opium_Wars"&gt;the Opium War&lt;/a&gt; caused by nothing but foreign bully
and their blood-thirsty greed, don't they see the parallel of what
they are doing right now, with this game!?&lt;/p&gt;

there are only three things that technology should bring, would bring,
and should their objectives:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;information repository&lt;/strong&gt;: everything is saved, time stamped,
   digitized, and probably even structured.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;efficiency&lt;/strong&gt;: this comes from the fact that data inputs are
   sanitized with definitions, rules, and assumptions &amp;mdash; the
   manual way of doing things bury all the domain knowledge within the
   head of individual employee. Instead, implementation of a system
   extract those into a more explicit form (code written, even though
   still arcane, is better than hidden in someone's brain/instinct),
   and this create efficiency, because communication cost is lowered
   &amp;mdash; within a system, each party uses the same set of
   vocabulary, and gradually adopting others' definitions. Conflicts
   are solve upfront in system design phase and being continuously
   negotiated so the system can function &lt;strong&gt;coherently&lt;/strong&gt;. Therefore,
   the system forms a framework to anchor discussion and debates.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;accountability&lt;/strong&gt;: this is really a workflow decision. I know
   clients who are horrified to have the transparency of data, because
   then decision maker …&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;</description><dc:creator xmlns:dc="http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/">Feng Xia</dc:creator><pubDate>Mon, 07 Aug 2017 15:21:00 -0400</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">tag:fengxia41103.github.io,2017-08-07:/myblog/what does it bring.html</guid><category>thoughts</category><category>thoughts</category></item><item><title>Lost jobs, not really</title><link>https://fengxia41103.github.io/myblog/lost%20jobs.html</link><description>&lt;figure class="col l6 m6 s12"&gt;
  &lt;img src="images/robot%20replace%20human.jpg"/&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;These days, everywhere you turn, there is talk about AI, and one
primary theme is the human fear of being replaced by robots, thus
resulting in huge waves of layoffs and job loss, which then leads to
social turmoils, revolutions, and government collapses. Horrible.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But if you think of it, it isn't new. Not only it isn't new, I think
it is one of those topics that is &lt;strong&gt;perpetual true&lt;/strong&gt; and &lt;strong&gt;perpetually
horrible&lt;/strong&gt;, whenever you bring it up. Like a nightmare, the only way
to deal with it, is to wake up (in other words, not to think of
it). As long as you put yourself into that scene, man, it's certainly
gonna be bad.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Exaggerated? Just take a step back and name all the parallels you can
think of &amp;mdash; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;when there is a more efficient way in production &amp;rarr; job loss&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;when there is a new way in production &amp;rarr; job loss&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;when an innovation emerges that takes the fantasy of everybody
   &amp;rarr; job loss&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Watching the &lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wR6SFLhD32Q&amp;amp;list=PLJA4Jys7jT0LR-Ze9Joi2OHsC6_BbY-Hp"&gt;Civilisaiton&lt;/a&gt; Youtube, what a fantastic topic and
description of western civilisation! This is quite interesting
especially with the backdrop of Jared
Diamond's &lt;a href="https://www.wikiwand.com/en/Guns,_Germs,_and_Steel"&gt;Guns, Germs, and Steel&lt;/a&gt;, which I found it godly
convincing as I was first introduced to think about the history of
human civilisation through his &lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i885hopsw6E"&gt;documentary&lt;/a&gt;.
However, the two views of what gave birth and energy to the rise and
fall of a civilisation are quite, different, though both are
intriguing and far beyond my scope of knowledge and even
imagination. Nonetheless, there is one thing suddenly came to me, and
I think it's a topic worth writing about.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What is it?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In all the videos, literature, thinking, and theory of the
indisputable advance of the western civilisation, there are plenty
episodes and text devoted to the dark side of the western history
&amp;mdash; slavery, the conquest of South America, war with the native
Indians... there were pure cruelty, absolutely inhumane deeds, against
animal, against nature, against another human being. It makes your
heart shaken; if there were God, he must have …&lt;/p&gt;</description><dc:creator xmlns:dc="http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/">Feng Xia</dc:creator><pubDate>Tue, 01 Aug 2017 20:46:00 -0400</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">tag:fengxia41103.github.io,2017-08-01:/myblog/self-reflection.html</guid><category>thoughts</category><category>thoughts</category></item><item><title>Marketing</title><link>https://fengxia41103.github.io/myblog/marketing.html</link><description>&lt;p&gt;Man wasn't that annoying! Listened to this &lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vIQ9IEW07g0&amp;amp;t=2290s"&gt;book&lt;/a&gt; on the way to
outlet yesterday, and the language it used annoyed the shxxt out of
me. Let me explain why.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;Total attention&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The content is actually fine. There is a total sum of &lt;code&gt;attention&lt;/code&gt;
consumers can provide:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;code&gt;total consumer attention&lt;/code&gt; = &lt;code&gt;num_of_consumer&lt;/code&gt; x &lt;code&gt;16 hr/day&lt;/code&gt; x &lt;code&gt;365
days/yr&lt;/code&gt; x &lt;code&gt;adjustment %&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So in essence this term is equivalent to a percentage of &lt;code&gt;total time&lt;/code&gt;
a consumer spends on a particular message, which corresponds to what I
have always been saying that the only dimension immune to any
manipulation and variables (by far) is &lt;span
class="myhighlight"&gt;time&lt;/span&gt; &amp;mdash; it is a continuously flow
forward. No one can stop it; no one can shorten it or expand it; and
nothing can ignore it. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So far, so good. Then the talk starts a deep dive into what he thinks
the successful stories of marketing by quoting history of certain
marketing and strategies, and that's when it started to annoy me,
badly.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;Grand labeling&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;First, the term &lt;code&gt;祖师爷&lt;/code&gt;. What does it …&lt;/p&gt;</description><dc:creator xmlns:dc="http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/">Feng Xia</dc:creator><pubDate>Sun, 30 Jul 2017 08:12:00 -0400</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">tag:fengxia41103.github.io,2017-07-30:/myblog/marketing.html</guid><category>thoughts</category><category>thoughts</category></item><item><title>Luck</title><link>https://fengxia41103.github.io/myblog/luck.html</link><description>&lt;figure class="col l4 m6 s12"&gt;
  &lt;img src="images/luck.jpg"/&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I was listening to this &lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2g_JFGnJMW4&amp;amp;t=1519s"&gt;talk&lt;/a&gt; on Youtube about luck, and that got
me thinking.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It's a cliche when people talk about luck, and someone gets lucky, or
unlucky. It feels it is something we have no control over, and it is
just randomly happened, for good and for bad. It is an easy
&lt;strong&gt;execuse&lt;/strong&gt; to make an unhappy reality tolerable, and a fortune
justifiable. But in the end, no one can explain what brought that luck
&amp;mdash; granted, there have always been many theories on its coming,
but the fundamental attribute of luck is that it is not predictable!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That's right. I suddenly realized what a luck is &amp;mdash; &lt;span
class="myhighlight"&gt;Luck only exists in a rear view
mirror&lt;/span&gt;. There is no such thing as &lt;strong&gt;forward looking&lt;/strong&gt; luck, or
&lt;strong&gt;future&lt;/strong&gt; luck, or &lt;strong&gt;you will get lucky&lt;/strong&gt;, because the truth is, you
don't know until it has happened and you already experienced the
result, whatever it may be, pleasant or horrible.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So why can't luck be something we can control, produce, maybe with a
lot of effort, but at …&lt;/p&gt;</description><dc:creator xmlns:dc="http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/">Feng Xia</dc:creator><pubDate>Sat, 29 Jul 2017 07:34:00 -0400</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">tag:fengxia41103.github.io,2017-07-29:/myblog/luck.html</guid><category>thoughts</category><category>thoughts</category></item><item><title>Math, the decline of the US</title><link>https://fengxia41103.github.io/myblog/is%20math%20important.html</link><description>&lt;p&gt;Came across an &lt;a href="https://www.zhihu.com/question/20953633"&gt;article&lt;/a&gt; tonight. The argument is actually not new
&amp;mdash; that US is now in decline and the only &lt;strong&gt;hard fact&lt;/strong&gt; that no
one is disagreeing, &lt;span class="myhighlight"&gt;its
leadership in technology&lt;/span&gt;, especially in computer related stuff,
is shaken. The evidence, or its supporting argument, comes in two
folds:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;that the education in American public school, in particular, its math
   education, is inferior to those in China.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;that US is losing magnetism to smart people:&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;the US policy is becoming less and less friendly,&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;its research funding is strained,&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;and their home country is becoming the opposite of a and b.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So this leads me to think just how logical this is? My question is, &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;is US's leading edge based on a superior math capability, or
imported talent (in many's mind, they also happen to be math wizard)?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I'm sure math is absolutely the foundation of what we human know about
this world. So is talents. Who doesn't like talent!? Any company does; any
country does. Even any person wishes having some talents. Good
education, of …&lt;/p&gt;</description><dc:creator xmlns:dc="http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/">Feng Xia</dc:creator><pubDate>Fri, 21 Jul 2017 20:30:00 -0400</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">tag:fengxia41103.github.io,2017-07-21:/myblog/is math important.html</guid><category>thoughts</category><category>thoughts</category></item><item><title>Data, Integrity</title><link>https://fengxia41103.github.io/myblog/data%20and%20credit%20score.html</link><description>&lt;p&gt;The first time reading &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/Trust-Social-Virtues-Creation-Prosperity/dp/0684825252"&gt;"Trust"&lt;/a&gt; by &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Francis_Fukuyama"&gt;Francis Fukuyama&lt;/a&gt;, I was
deeply impressed by his distinction that Chinese trust is implied,
such as inner circle of immediate family, friends, extended through
marriage... while the Western version is explicit, for example, the
credit score system.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;Now we have data&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;figure class="col l8 m12 s12 center"&gt;
  &lt;img src="images/data%20and%20love.png"/&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;With China's economy boom and in particular the ever thirsty
interest by the mass of any kind of financial leverage, the only
barrier everyone agrees upon that is holding the lenders back to lend
more and borrowers back to borrow more, is the lack of a personal credit
score. &lt;span class="myhighlight"&gt;How wonderful the world is going to
be if only everyone has a credit score!&lt;/span&gt; even better, if that
score is tracked and publicized and supervised and distilled by the
almighty government, isn't it just a paradise on earth?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Is it!?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The concept is very enticing. This score, like what we have in the US,
will hinder you from doing bad things, breaking laws, defaulting
loans, dodging tax, and even being on welfare for too long &amp;mdash; it
is a …&lt;/p&gt;</description><dc:creator xmlns:dc="http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/">Feng Xia</dc:creator><pubDate>Wed, 12 Jul 2017 20:30:00 -0400</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">tag:fengxia41103.github.io,2017-07-12:/myblog/data and credit score.html</guid><category>thoughts</category><category>thoughts</category></item><item><title>Can you innovate?</title><link>https://fengxia41103.github.io/myblog/can%20you%20innovate.html</link><description>&lt;p&gt;This has been a topic on my mind for quite some time now ever since I
worked in Shanghai in 2016 and witnessed things that quite annoyed me,
especially from a software engineer prospective. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So the backdrop is that Chinese people have been encouraged by
the country's phenomenal success in economy and are now moving from &lt;em&gt;made in
china&lt;/em&gt; to &lt;em&gt;created in china&lt;/em&gt; &amp;mdash; a sound idea, just like
&lt;em&gt;socialism&lt;/em&gt; or any other idea someone around the corner has. The
idea is not the problem, the implementer is.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ideas are cheap. There is a problem xyz, easy. The challenge is how we
are gonna find a solution for this problem, let alone a &lt;em&gt;satisfactory&lt;/em&gt;
one? Well, no one can really define that. Even when you talk about a
&lt;em&gt;working&lt;/em&gt; solution, the immediate argument will be what you mean by
&lt;em&gt;working&lt;/em&gt;? How do you prove it works? This sounds more and more like
an attorney's job now, doesn't it? Well, let's leave this
philosophical dilemma and rant about why I was annoyed by this
innovation wave.&lt;/p&gt;

Ansible has the mouth (and market) share these
days. For our modeling purpose, we are to utilize its procedural
strength to carry out actions, which provides an abstraction instead
of coding in charm's Python files.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Design objectives:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Design as reusable &lt;a href="https://jujucharms.com/docs/2.1/developer-layers"&gt;layer(s)&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Be compatible with Ubuntu and CentOS&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Simple pattern to execute a playbook&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Assumption:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Playbooks will be local (in charm) so to maintain the
   atomic nature of a HW charm &amp;mdash; the model contains both the
   declaration of attributes and actions to handle runtime state transitions.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;Method 1: layer-ansible&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Method 1 is to use an existing project, &lt;a href="https://github.com/chuckbutler/charms.ansible"&gt;layer-ansible&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Examine its code reveals a typical pattern one would use to introduce
a new function:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Install Ansible. The approach it took is to use a
   &lt;code&gt;ppa:ansible/ansible&lt;/code&gt; source and installed by calling
   &lt;code&gt;charmhelpers.fetch.apt_install&lt;/code&gt;. The key issue here is using &lt;code&gt;ppa&lt;/code&gt;
   which is an &lt;strong&gt;hardcoded&lt;/strong&gt; Ubuntu approach.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="highlight"&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;code&gt;```python
def install_ansible_support(from_ppa=True, ppa_location=&amp;#39;ppa:ansible/ansible&amp;#39;):

&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I have pretty low tolerance of BS. The hot topic of AI bothers me
a great deal, because it is being discussed by too many ppl who have no
context. It is becoming just another buzz word rolling off your tongue
to make you sound sophisticated and smart. But no, AI is neither
magic nor intimidating. I think it is a great example for human being
to looking at things with a straight face, cut to the core, no more
BS, no more hand waving and using some abstract, ideological fuzziness
to fool ppl.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At least 20 years ago I have read a line about artificial
intelligence, which cleared formed my view on this &amp;mdash; There are
two ways to define &lt;strong&gt;intelligence&lt;/strong&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Machine emulate human's train of thoughts, and derives
   the same conclusion.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Machine ignores your human brain, finds its own way, and
   arrive the same conclusion.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The key is, &lt;span class="myhighlight"&gt;the final result is the

&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;很多人都i知道，浪漫的爱情里，两个人都怕时间太短，都说要长相守，两不忘。
最浪漫的话，是陪你慢慢变老。 Then this morning I had another
thought. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;All families have some burdens that trouble them, regardless how
wealthy they are, how wonderful they look to outsiders, how much love
they have for each other. There just
isn't one single, perfectly happy, worry-free, trouble-free,
conflict-free family. But then, with dad's current condition, he
doesn't understand these troubles anymore. What used to be a
forbidden topic can now be safely said in front of him &amp;mdash;
grantedly he has his own world these days and that world isn't worry
free either. However, he is not bothered by the worries that is
troubling me.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So I was thinking, the most romantic thing is not to accompany you
till age, but &lt;span class="myhighlight"&gt;to be with you till you don't
remember the past anymore.&lt;/span&gt; 是的，就是这样的 …&lt;/p&gt;</description><dc:creator xmlns:dc="http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/">Feng Xia</dc:creator><pubDate>Sat, 03 Jun 2017 08:20:00 -0400</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">tag:fengxia41103.github.io,2017-06-03:/myblog/love till past.html</guid><category>thoughts</category><category>love</category></item><item><title>Teahouse</title><link>https://fengxia41103.github.io/myblog/teahouse.html</link><description>&lt;figure class="col l6 m6 s12"&gt;

&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is an interesting thought. I am listening to this talk show about
三里屯, and guests are discussing the come and go of bars in this
place. For those who don't know this place, it's a section in BJ that
has a lot of bars which aggregated young ppl and foreigners.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What's interesting of the topic is when a guest mentioned about bars
in Europe, for example, that had its good days and bad days. Yet it's
still there after 30, 40 years. The owner is now a middle age man
instead of a young fella, and the place is still running, even with a
taste of similar food, similar decoration, a few more photos that ppl
can recognize the link between then and now, a trace of heritage.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Doesn't this description remind you the well-known play, &lt;a href="https://zh.wikipedia.org/wiki/茶馆_(话剧)"&gt;Teahouse 茶
馆&lt;/a&gt;? The backdrop of the play was a turmoil era in the Chinese
history when the world was experiencing the WWI and WWII. Many were
lost, disrupted, changed. In the play, the teahouse was …&lt;/p&gt;</description><dc:creator xmlns:dc="http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/">Feng Xia</dc:creator><pubDate>Fri, 02 Jun 2017 10:00:00 -0400</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">tag:fengxia41103.github.io,2017-06-02:/myblog/teahouse.html</guid><category>thoughts</category><category>thoughts</category></item><item><title>A color</title><link>https://fengxia41103.github.io/myblog/color.html</link><description>&lt;figure class="col l6 m6 s12"&gt;
  &lt;img src="images/funny/color.png"/&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is interesting. I am at the nursing home eating, and suddenly
realized the color of the book cover that I'm reading is nearly
identical to the color of the food containers. You know what? I have never
noticed this color before, nor would ever thought I will give it a
second thought. But then looking up, there it is, again, lying around
me, without me ever seeing it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What is this color? &lt;span style="color:#F6CEF5"&gt;#F6CEF5&lt;/span&gt; is the
closest my eyes can tell. But men are known to be insensitive to
colors. So I'm not sure how accurate this number reflects what I saw.
I have thought this color really &lt;strong&gt;cheezy&lt;/strong&gt;, but it speaks to me in a
way like never before, and I couldn't help wondering that your life is
marked by various ppl with their leftovers, some left a smile, some
left a sadness, some a regret, some a long lost friendship, some a
music, and another a color.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I know there is color theory that some are matching with others which
please the eyes …&lt;/p&gt;</description><dc:creator xmlns:dc="http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/">Feng Xia</dc:creator><pubDate>Thu, 01 Jun 2017 13:00:00 -0400</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">tag:fengxia41103.github.io,2017-06-01:/myblog/color.html</guid><category>thoughts</category><category>thoughts</category></item><item><title>Zebra line</title><link>https://fengxia41103.github.io/myblog/zebra%20line.html</link><description>&lt;figure class="col l6 m6 s12"&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Walking on the street in SH, I just realized what is wrong with this
place. So I was walking across this giant intersection, and I do mean
&lt;strong&gt;giant&lt;/strong&gt; because everytime I had to put in the high gear and used my
dash speed at the first moment the walking sign turned green in order
to &lt;strong&gt;barely&lt;/strong&gt; make to the other side, provides there were many
cars making their right turn and cut me off in the middle of the
intersection. Let's put this way, to walk across these modern looking
six-lane intersection is a matter of courage, full mindness of being
ready to die, or fight, and a secret pray that the drivers will let
you pass, or the guy next to you will block the hit for you.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This doesn't sound good. So SH puts out an army of &lt;strong&gt;social workers&lt;/strong&gt; on
the street to manage these intersections. They can be spotted with
uniform and often a flag in hand. I was just starting the dash when
the uniform turned to me and clearly …&lt;/p&gt;</description><dc:creator xmlns:dc="http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/">Feng Xia</dc:creator><pubDate>Wed, 31 May 2017 19:45:00 -0400</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">tag:fengxia41103.github.io,2017-05-31:/myblog/zebra line.html</guid><category>thoughts</category><category>thoughts</category></item><item><title>Sound of silence</title><link>https://fengxia41103.github.io/myblog/sound%20of%20silence.html</link><description>&lt;figure class="col l4 m4 s12"&gt;

&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;What is everybody looking for? Identity? I see people in the middle of
the social rung are all searching for something. Waking up this
morning and walking on the street, the place was certainly busier
after the holiday, more ppl, more cars, more purpose. Do ppl at the
bottom of the rung bother with a purpose in life? and if you look at
the social spectrum, can I say there are only two ppl who are probably
not bothered by this question &amp;mdash; the two at each extreme of the
spectrum, then everyone else fall into the &lt;strong&gt;middle&lt;/strong&gt;, so called
middle class? But I don't believe the richest of the rich is anxiety
free either. He has his own problems, just that I don't know. It's too
far away form the life I know of that the problem is keenly true to
him, but irrelevant to me. Well, almost so, until by the pattern of
history, his trouble and his struggle will flow into my life at some
point and make my life uncomfortable, too. But …&lt;/p&gt;</description><dc:creator xmlns:dc="http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/">Feng Xia</dc:creator><pubDate>Wed, 31 May 2017 07:45:00 -0400</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">tag:fengxia41103.github.io,2017-05-31:/myblog/sound of silence.html</guid><category>thoughts</category><category>love</category></item><item><title>Girl's love</title><link>https://fengxia41103.github.io/myblog/girl%20love.html</link><description>&lt;figure class="col l4 m4 s12"&gt;

&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Watching all the little kids running around at this public square in
a summer evening, I was thinking to myself, "boy, that's a lot of kids. And
each one of them came from a man and a woman, and they had to have sex
at some point to make this happen, and that moment was supposed to be
a time they were so attracted to each other and trusted each other
that especially the woman was willing to bear the seed so to make this
baby." But then looking at the couples around the kids, I couldn't
help wondering how could the guy be attractive to the girl, and vice
versa. I mean, many of them don't look that match. But somehow, the
woman liked the guy, and the guy liked the woman. Well, I suppose
there was love, or there is love, at least at the moment of the
sex.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So if I look at the guys (and most of the women), they are not that
attractive at all. Especially for the guys, many …&lt;/p&gt;</description><dc:creator xmlns:dc="http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/">Feng Xia</dc:creator><pubDate>Mon, 29 May 2017 21:00:00 -0400</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">tag:fengxia41103.github.io,2017-05-29:/myblog/girl love.html</guid><category>thoughts</category><category>thoughts</category></item><item><title>Charm layer-basic</title><link>https://fengxia41103.github.io/myblog/charm%20layer-basic.html</link><description>&lt;p&gt;Have you ever wondered what &lt;a href="https://github.com/juju-solutions/layer-basic.git"&gt;layer-basic&lt;/a&gt; is for? and why every
charm needs to include it? In this article we will take a look
at its code base to decipher this mystery.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;Hooks&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We already know hooks are hardcoded. Juju expects certain hooks and
hook sequence is always executed in an order that is dictated by Juju
code.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;figure class="s12 center"&gt;
  &lt;img src="images/charm%20hooks.png" /&gt;
  &lt;figcaption&gt;Sequence of charm hooks&lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;What do we see in hooks? If you run &lt;code&gt;charm build&lt;/code&gt; and examine the &lt;code&gt;dist&lt;/code&gt; folder,
hooks live in &lt;code&gt;dist/yourcharm/hooks&lt;/code&gt; folder:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="highlight"&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;code&gt;.
├──&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;config-changed
├──&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;hook.template
├──&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;install
├──&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;leader-elected
├──&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;leader-settings-changed
├──&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;relations
│&lt;span class="w"&gt;   &lt;/span&gt;└──&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;rack-pdu
│&lt;span class="w"&gt;       &lt;/span&gt;├──&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;__init__.py
│&lt;span class="w"&gt;       &lt;/span&gt;├──&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;interface.yaml
│&lt;span class="w"&gt;       &lt;/span&gt;├──&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;provides.py
│&lt;span class="w"&gt;       &lt;/span&gt;└──&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;requires.py
├──&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;start
├──&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;stop
├──&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;update-status
└──&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;upgrade-charm
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We know we haven't defined any custom hook code for this charm,
so how were they generated? Even more interesting is
that all hooks are strangely &lt;strong&gt;identical&lt;/strong&gt;.
Take &lt;code&gt;install&lt;/code&gt; hook script for example:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="highlight"&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class="ch"&gt;#!/usr/bin/env python3&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class="c1"&gt;# Load modules from $JUJU_CHARM_DIR/lib&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="kn"&gt;import&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nn"&gt;sys&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class="kn"&gt;from&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nn"&gt;charms.layer&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="kn"&gt;import&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;basic&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class="c1"&gt;# This will load and run the appropriate @hook and other decorated&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="c1"&gt;# handlers from $JUJU_CHARM_DIR/reactive, $JUJU_CHARM_DIR/hooks/reactive,&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="c1"&gt;# and $JUJU_CHARM_DIR/hooks …&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</description><dc:creator xmlns:dc="http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/">Feng Xia</dc:creator><pubDate>Mon, 29 May 2017 09:22:00 -0400</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">tag:fengxia41103.github.io,2017-05-29:/myblog/charm layer-basic.html</guid><category>openstack</category><category>lenovo</category></item><item><title>Irresponsible response</title><link>https://fengxia41103.github.io/myblog/irresponsible%20response.html</link><description>&lt;figure class="col l6 m6 s12"&gt;
  &lt;img src="images/funny/prime.png"/&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Doesn't the title sound like a tongue twister? That's where the irony
is. How can you make a response &lt;strong&gt;irresponsible&lt;/strong&gt;? and what does it
give? Any harm done? Does it matter? What does it mean when it
happens? Why do ppl give such response? and why would ppl accept them?
or do they?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;The play&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The whole thing started one morning when I was sitting in this noodle
shop eating breakfast. A woman walked in and ordered a fried dish. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Cashier girl: This dish needs wait.&lt;br&gt;
Woman: Oh, how long would that be?&lt;br&gt;
Cashier girl: They just started cooking them.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The conversation ended there. Strange! well, at least to my ears, this
is really really strange, and frustrating, and maddening, and is the
root cause of everything that you don't like about this society, this
country, this life. Really.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The woman was certainly not satisfied with the response. However, she
didn't pursue. Obviously she asked the question because she wanted to
decide whether she wanted to wait for this dish (if wait time is
acceptable …&lt;/p&gt;</description><dc:creator xmlns:dc="http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/">Feng Xia</dc:creator><pubDate>Sun, 28 May 2017 08:00:00 -0400</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">tag:fengxia41103.github.io,2017-05-28:/myblog/irresponsible response.html</guid><category>thoughts</category><category>thoughts</category></item><item><title>Juju charm Python2</title><link>https://fengxia41103.github.io/myblog/python2%20charm.html</link><description>&lt;p&gt;Charm is based on Python 3 while RHEL/CentOS7 ships&lt;/p&gt;</description><dc:creator xmlns:dc="http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/">Feng Xia</dc:creator><pubDate>Sat, 27 May 2017 10:00:00 -0400</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">tag:fengxia41103.github.io,2017-05-27:/myblog/python2 charm.html</guid><category>openstack</category><category>lenovo</category></item><item><title>Consume the future</title><link>https://fengxia41103.github.io/myblog/future%20value.html</link><description>&lt;figure class="col l6 m6 s12"&gt;
  &lt;img src="images/funny/kickoff.jpg"/&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I was thinking about &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Future_value"&gt;future value&lt;/a&gt; this morning. Why? because I
was thinking about this Chinese phrase, 寅吃卯粮, which means that one
consumes savings meant for future use. The term bears a negative
emotion that is used to criticize someone or some action that is
irresponsible (in view of the present) and generally a bad idea. After
all, shouldn't one only use what his means can cover? It is a
conservative approach, and also sustainable.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What's the equivalent in
english? I thought of future value. Isn't it the same thing that we
are mapping future values to current so we can benefit from, or
consume, it right now. For all we know, forget about the future. It's
uncertain and nobody knows how well those so called &lt;strong&gt;future values&lt;/strong&gt;
will be realized and how well they matching our estimation right now.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The reason I was toying these terms was that I was thinking the &lt;span
class="myhighlight"&gt;root cause of wealth&lt;/span&gt;. I always thought that
the only way to become rich is to take leverage. What …&lt;/p&gt;</description><dc:creator xmlns:dc="http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/">Feng Xia</dc:creator><pubDate>Wed, 24 May 2017 08:36:00 -0400</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">tag:fengxia41103.github.io,2017-05-24:/myblog/future value.html</guid><category>thoughts</category><category>thoughts</category></item><item><title>Sync vs. Async</title><link>https://fengxia41103.github.io/myblog/sync%20async.html</link><description>&lt;figure class="col l4 m4 s12"&gt;
  &lt;img src="images/funny/pointers.png"/&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;h1&gt;Irrelevant&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Sync vs. Async. I have been thinking this to myself and have involved
quite a few discussions with smart (and mostly young) developers which
from time to time makes me wonder whether there is a definite answer
for this at all.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One thing I can fairly state is that there isn't a &lt;strong&gt;right&lt;/strong&gt; or even
an answer. It depends. Yes, it depends on what you mean by sync or
async, and why you care about one way or the other. The discussion
isn't technical, it isn't philosophical, it is to understand use case,
user's expectation, workflow, execution sequence, business assumption,
and maybe last, system performance. If the discussion isn't confined
in these areas, it will go nowhere and quickly downgrade to a heated
argument without a satisfaction from either parties involved but
feelings hurt, self-opinion firmer believed in, and a mine field that
no one is willing to step into again.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Really, a particular framework or programming language does not make
the design async or sync. &lt;a href="http://www.tornadoweb.org/en/stable/"&gt;Tornado&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://github.com/twisted/twisted"&gt;Twisted&lt;/a&gt;, or libs like

&lt;p&gt;I was sitting in this underground little food court, breathing the
muggy air, eating a spicy food, watching people coming in and out,
full of life, full of noise, full of hope. Yet, I kept wondering that
everybody here has one type of headache or another in their lives,
just the same. But how ignorant we are of each other. We judge
people's mind from such a shallow observation, yet have no mean nor
much interest in knowing what they really are. The only thing we know
is that they must have something that bother them, make them sad, make
them happy, make them mad, make them forget the life troubles for a
moment, and make them fall into a sinking feeling late at night that
they felt giving it up.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That's how I felt. The two weeks have been a tough time. I knew it's
coming. Mentally it's such a sure thing that I felt watching a train
approaching a station, however slow it may be, it is coming, and there
is no other …&lt;/p&gt;</description><dc:creator xmlns:dc="http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/">Feng Xia</dc:creator><pubDate>Sat, 13 May 2017 09:10:00 -0400</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">tag:fengxia41103.github.io,2017-05-13:/myblog/what a day.html</guid><category>thoughts</category><category>love</category></item><item><title>Nursing home evaluation</title><link>https://fengxia41103.github.io/myblog/nursing%20home%20evaluation.html</link><description>&lt;figure class="col l6 m6 s12"&gt;

   to be the best option in Suzhou.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;上海泰康申园: recommended by a BJ friend. The facility also has locations in
   BJ and Guangzhou. Well known for its patients such as 前外交部长吴

   location to location free of charge.&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Maybe it's the travel, maybe it's the stress of my dad's worsening
health condition, maybe I'm tired from all these and trying the
impossible without knowing the loss is done already. But I know why
I'm sad. The life went the way I hoped but myself couldn't bear the
thought nor the future. What is wrong with me!? Why cannt I stand by a
thought and take its consequence instead of saddening when it is lost
but cannt hold on when it's there?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There hasn't been a movie touched me like this for a long time. But
this one hit me to the core. I don't know. Why cannt people hold on to
love and go through the so called realities and come out cherishing
each other more? Shouldn't the common struggle and experience and the
talk and the happy and unhappy moments become a milestone that marks
the path both have walked, together? How many times can you really
walk with someone so close, so intimate, so letting all guards down,
weaving the image …&lt;/p&gt;</description><dc:creator xmlns:dc="http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/">Feng Xia</dc:creator><pubDate>Sun, 30 Apr 2017 23:57:00 -0400</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">tag:fengxia41103.github.io,2017-04-30:/myblog/la la land.html</guid><category>thoughts</category><category>love</category></item><item><title>Bye Bye GFW</title><link>https://fengxia41103.github.io/myblog/bye%20bye%20gfw.html</link><description>&lt;figure class="col l3 m3 s12"&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The GFW is nothing but an anti-humanity instance that blocks knowledge
transfer and information sharing in the 21st century when brain is the
competition advantage and this gov decides to sacrifice all the future
with a vain hope that creativity can continue to flourish while its
citizens are excluded from the rest of the world. The most frustrating
point is that technology forums are handicapped in the crossfire to a
ridiculous degree, for example, my experience with Stackoverflow has
been downgraded to having at least 50% &lt;strong&gt;dead links&lt;/strong&gt; due to the
blocking. Come on! and you are talking about technology innovation!?
Get a grip.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;How do I know this ia bad!? Well, when my brain has to slow down to
cope with incoming information, it is a sign that this place is
culturally backwards and hopeless, because my brain, though not that
much impressive and has average power most of the time, is being
wasted due to artificial barrier which has no reason to exist

charm. Chained states is essentially mirroring a pattern of any sequential
execution in a workflow. Potentially each execution block can also
have conditions to set the next state, even though this type of knowledge
should be exposed outside function element, if possible, and to be
handled by something better than pure code (eg. BPMN).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The model for this experiment is straightforward. We create a layer
with three states: &lt;code&gt;state.1&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code&gt;state.2&lt;/code&gt;, and &lt;code&gt;state.3&lt;/code&gt;. Upon start
charm kicks off execution of &lt;code&gt;state.1&lt;/code&gt;, which then transit itself to
the &lt;code&gt;state.2&lt;/code&gt;, then to &lt;code&gt;state.3&lt;/code&gt;, and then loop back to &lt;code&gt;state.1&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;figcaption&gt;Charm design pattern: chain states&lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The key questions to answer in this experiment are:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;What is the entry point to start the first state?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;If setting two states true, are they executed serially or
   in parallel?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Can a blocking command halt state transition even if there are
   states being true and can be acted upon? &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After becoming an Emacs user for the last few months, I acquired a
burning desire to migrate as much as my daily text editing activities
into Emacs environment, in particular, emails.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Having tried &lt;a href="https://fengxia41103.github.io/myblog/downloads/davmail.properties"&gt;offlineimap&lt;/a&gt; for a bit, I ended up battling its
configuration to make it work (sort of) with Hotmail's IMAP. Gmail
worked flawlessly, but boy, Microsoft, get a grip. No wonder hotmail
is dying. But in the end I'm just one guy who holds on something
linking my youth days, for sentimental purpose. So without being able
to win the battle with offlineimap, I started searching for
alternatives, then I found &lt;a href="http://isync.sourceforge.net/mbsync.html"&gt;mbsync&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Its &lt;a href="http://isync.sourceforge.net/mbsync.html"&gt;man page&lt;/a&gt; is worth a read. It looks intimidating at first
glance, but it isn't really. In a nutshell, it defines three things:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;A remote store&lt;/strong&gt;: this also links to an &lt;strong&gt;Account&lt;/strong&gt;, which of
   course holds your email credentials.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;A local store&lt;/strong&gt;: this defines local file structure where you want
   to emails to be downloaded to.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;A channel&lt;/strong&gt;: a link that connects the a remote store with a local
   store …&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;</description><dc:creator xmlns:dc="http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/">Feng Xia</dc:creator><pubDate>Mon, 24 Apr 2017 10:15:00 -0400</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">tag:fengxia41103.github.io,2017-04-24:/myblog/mbsync mu4e email.html</guid><category>dev</category><category>dev</category></item><item><title>MAAS vs. Ironic</title><link>https://fengxia41103.github.io/myblog/maas%20and%20ironic.html</link><description>&lt;p&gt;This article is to analyze Openstack Ironic and Canonical MAAS, both
are tools to turn baremetal into a pool of managed resources that are
ready for consumption by upstream srervice.  On the highest level, a
baremetal is either managed or not-managed. Being &lt;strong&gt;managed&lt;/strong&gt; requires
that the manager is aware of the existence of the baremetal, and has
acquired necessary information of the server so that these two things
are now possible:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Power cycle the server&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Install a software such as operating system&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The general process of managing a baremetal is straightforward.
Baremetal life cycle can be viewed in the following states. Names and
details of each state and state transitions differ, but the concept
remains valid. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;span class="myhighlight"&gt;unknown&lt;/span&gt;: Baremetal is not managed.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;span class="myhighlight"&gt;enlisted&lt;/span&gt;: Manager is now aware of
   the existence of the baremetal. It does not yet have sufficient
   information to cycle its power or loading anything to execute on it.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;span class="myhighlight"&gt;ready for provisioning&lt;/span&gt;: Sometimes
   also called &lt;em&gt;hardware inventory&lt;/em&gt; phase, in which the manager has
   acquired capability to control the server's power. Knowing other
   server characteristics …&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;</description><dc:creator xmlns:dc="http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/">Feng Xia</dc:creator><pubDate>Thu, 30 Mar 2017 10:20:00 -0400</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">tag:fengxia41103.github.io,2017-03-30:/myblog/maas and ironic.html</guid><category>openstack</category><category>lenovo</category></item><item><title>Baremetal provisioning</title><link>https://fengxia41103.github.io/myblog/baremetal%20provisioning.html</link><description>&lt;p&gt;Everyone of us has installed an operating system to a computer at some
point in life. It is easy to perceive inserting a disk or USB key to
make this happen because the OS files are &lt;em&gt;there&lt;/em&gt;. A fancier version
is to boot from network using PXE boot option, which seems like a
magic (when the environment has been setup) &amp;mdash; it somehow finds
the OS image and start installing, all over a &lt;em&gt;network&lt;/em&gt;!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now if we move to the world of servers, it works the same
way. Baremetal is another name referring to a server that has no
operating system (or hypervisor) installed yet. But the challenge is
to physically access to it to insert that OS disk &amp;mdash; in a data
center setting, I think the walking part is neither fun nor
desired. Remote provisioning is, therefore, the way to go.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;First, let's define &lt;strong&gt;provisioning&lt;/strong&gt;. Here we mean to have installed
an operating system or hypervisor on a baremetal so it is available
for further software installation.  In the simplest term, one needs to

The
plan was to first figure out Ironic APIs that will achieve what Juju
provider needs &amp;mdash; start an instance on demand, then build those
REST requests into Juju provider code. After playing with Ironic API
and Openstack's Devstack for two weeks, I start to realize that Ironic
by itself doesn't do much. Instead, it heavily relies on other
Openstack services to provision a baremetal &amp;mdash; Keystone to
generate a token which will be used in all HTTP calls, Neutron to
provide network/&lt;em&gt;port&lt;/em&gt;, Ironic itself to manage a &lt;em&gt;node&lt;/em&gt;, Glance to
get kernel image, ramdisk image, and actual OS image, and Nova to
&lt;em&gt;orchestrate&lt;/em&gt; these information for Ironic API to consume.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ironic &lt;a href="https://docs.openstack.org/developer/ironic/deploy/user-guide.html"&gt;user guide&lt;/a&gt; has some good information on basic technology
and Ironic design. A &lt;a href="https://www.openstack.org/videos/vancouver-2015/isn-and-039t-it-ironic-the-bare-metal-cloud"&gt;talk&lt;/a&gt; &amp;amp; &lt;a href="https://github.com/devananda/talks/blob/master/isnt-it-ironic.html"&gt;slides&lt;/a&gt; by &lt;a href="https://github.com/devananda"&gt;devananda&lt;/a&gt; on 2015
Vancouver Summit is also a good point to start.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the following sections I'd like to use the questions I have
encountered in research to create a newbie-oriented tutorial on
Ironic.

It promises a selection of blueprints
that hold magic to make an application deployment easy. But devils are
in the details, as always the case. In this article we will walk in
the charm world to learn its design.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;Bundle, charm, service, application&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Juju &lt;a href="https://jujucharms.com/docs/stable/juju-concepts"&gt;terms&lt;/a&gt; can be confusing. Approximately they can be viewed in
a tree model, where a bundle can have multiple charms, a charm can
contain multiple &lt;a href="https://jujucharms.com/docs/2.0/authors-subordinate-services"&gt;services&lt;/a&gt;, a service is composed of one or more
applications and a group of &lt;a href="https://jujucharms.com/docs/1.24/charms-relations"&gt;relations&lt;/a&gt;, and a relation, if
defined, must be one of the two types:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;provide&lt;/strong&gt; (eg. I am MySQL and I provide a SQL database relation).&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;require&lt;/strong&gt; (eg. I'm Mediawiki and I require a SQL database).&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

  &lt;figcaption&gt;Juju control modeling&lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In term of deployment, a service can be deployed to more than one
machine so as to achieve HA; a machine can also have more than one
services. Here we use the term machine broadly because it can also be
a single LXD container, so in this case there can …&lt;/p&gt;</description><dc:creator xmlns:dc="http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/">Feng Xia</dc:creator><pubDate>Tue, 28 Feb 2017 17:00:00 -0500</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">tag:fengxia41103.github.io,2017-02-28:/myblog/juju charm layers.html</guid><category>openstack</category><category>lenovo</category></item><item><title>Juju deploy and Provider</title><link>https://fengxia41103.github.io/myblog/juju%20deploy%20provider.html</link><description>&lt;p&gt;In &lt;a href="https://fengxia41103.github.io/myblog/juju deploy.html"&gt;this&lt;/a&gt; article, we have demonstrated how Juju deploys a charm,
including what makes a node eligible as a target and what files will
be put on by the deployer.If you recall, there were four steps in a
deploy process:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Add a new machine to the cloud environment. In the &lt;a href="https://fengxia41103.github.io/myblog/juju deploy.html"&gt;demo&lt;/a&gt;, we
   added this machine manually using &lt;code&gt;juju add-machine&lt;/code&gt; command.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Machine-0 recognizes the new node.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;CLI issues a deploy command.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Charm gets deployed.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This usecase, however, is somewhat backwards -- we have provisioned a
machine prior to the deploy command. Wouldn't it be better if the
command will signal the cloud provider to create a new machine on the
fly? MAAS provider can almost do just that.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;MAAS way of a deploy&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We have briefly touched upon &lt;a href="https://fengxia41103.github.io/myblog/juju deploy.html"&gt;the MAAS way&lt;/a&gt;.  By default, Juju
deploy will request for a new machine unless using the &lt;code&gt;--to [machine
number]&lt;/code&gt; flag. While using MAAS it is seen that MAAS will turn a
&lt;code&gt;READY&lt;/code&gt; machine into &lt;code&gt;ALLOCATED&lt;/code&gt; then &lt;code&gt;DEPLOYING&lt;/code&gt;. Once a Juju agent
is installed (provisioned), the agent executes application …&lt;/p&gt;</description><dc:creator xmlns:dc="http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/">Feng Xia</dc:creator><pubDate>Wed, 08 Feb 2017 14:00:00 -0500</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">tag:fengxia41103.github.io,2017-02-08:/myblog/juju deploy provider.html</guid><category>openstack</category><category>lenovo</category></item><item><title>Emacs</title><link>https://fengxia41103.github.io/myblog/emacs.html</link><description>&lt;p&gt;What a wonderful editor!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I wouldn't even call it an editor because it can do so much beyond
text editing. Still on the learning curve to get a grasp of what it
can do in my daily development workflow.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;install emacs26&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The easiest way to get this: &lt;code&gt;sudo add-apt-repository
ppa:kelleyk/emacs&lt;/code&gt;, then &lt;code&gt;apt remove emacs emacs25 &amp;amp;&amp;amp; apt update &amp;amp;&amp;amp;
apt install emacs26&lt;/code&gt;, then verify &lt;code&gt;emacs --version&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;bootstrap &amp;amp; config&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Welcome the wonderful &lt;code&gt;org-mode&lt;/code&gt; and the &lt;a href="https://fengxia41103.github.io/myblog/downloads/emacs/emacs_setup.html"&gt;config file in org-mode&lt;/a&gt;. Bootstrap is easy:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;backup your current emacs: &lt;code&gt;mv ~/.emacs.d ~/.emacs.d.bak&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;create &lt;code&gt;.emacs&lt;/code&gt;, or copy &lt;a href="https://fengxia41103.github.io/myblog/downloads/emacs/dot_emacs.el"&gt;.emacs&lt;/a&gt; to &lt;code&gt;~&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;launch emacs, sit back, and once all packages are downloaded and
   compiled, you are done.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;replace in files&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Replacing a string match in multiple files is common, but
tricky. Emacs doesn't make this intuitive at all. Follow these steps
to get there:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;code&gt;M-x find-grep-dired&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;code&gt;Find-grep (directory)&lt;/code&gt;: is to select the root folder for the scan&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;code&gt;Find-grep (grep regexp)&lt;/code&gt;: is the regex for the string pattern you
   are searching, eg. &lt;code&gt;"images/&lt;/code&gt; is to find anything starts with a

In this article, we will
continue our research into another important function &amp;mdash; juju
deploy.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Deploy will command a node to pull down requested charm and install
whatever needed based the charm's instruction. As the bootstrap
research, I'm interested in the internal mechanism of this process,
the bare minimum to simulate a successful run, and the minimum steps
to repeat this for development and troubleshooting.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;Screencast&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;See the process in action:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;figure class="s12 center"&gt;
    &lt;img src="images/juju%20deploy%20jenkins.gif" /&gt;
    &lt;figcaption&gt;Screencast of juju deploying Jenkins&lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Juju + MAAS&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We have already covered state machine of &lt;a href="https://fengxia41103.github.io/myblog/maas target.html"&gt;MAAS target node&lt;/a&gt;. In the
context of deploying a charm driven by Juju, we can take a look MAAS
internals how those states are related.&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;figcaption&gt;MAAS target node state diagram during Juju deploy process&lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;h1&gt;Deploy steps illustrated&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is a more detailed view of juju deploying a charm broken down
into three steps.&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;figcaption&gt;
        Illustration of a Juju cloud environment before a deployment
    &lt;/figcaption&gt; 
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In this environment, we have a CLI controller where we will type in
juju commands, one state controller who manages the cloud, and …&lt;/p&gt;</description><dc:creator xmlns:dc="http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/">Feng Xia</dc:creator><pubDate>Thu, 19 Jan 2017 15:45:00 -0500</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">tag:fengxia41103.github.io,2017-01-19:/myblog/juju deploy.html</guid><category>openstack</category><category>lenovo</category></item><item><title>Juju bootstrap process</title><link>https://fengxia41103.github.io/myblog/juju%20bootstrap.html</link><description>&lt;p&gt;The very first command user will encounter is the &lt;code&gt;juju bootstrap&lt;/code&gt;. It
createa a special machine &amp;mdash; state controller, &lt;code&gt;machine-0&lt;/code&gt;,
control node, etc. &amp;mdash; naming convention aside, it is the brain
that tracks others nodes in the cloud, applications installed and
their status.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;Screencast&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Through research I want to learn about its process, internal
mechanism, how this command triggers off other juju components, what
is the minimum take to simulate a successful bootstrap, and if things
go south, what is the minimum to simulate a clean state so we can run
&lt;code&gt;juju bootstrap&lt;/code&gt; again as if from scratch. This last point is
particuarly useful for development and troubleshooting.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;figure class="s12 center"&gt;
    &lt;img src="images/juju%20bootstrap.gif" /&gt;
    &lt;figcaption&gt;Screencast of juju bootstraping a cloud environment&lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;First thing first, if we have create a cloud or are using a stock
cloud type:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="highlight"&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;code&gt;$&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;juju&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;bootstrap&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;[&lt;/span&gt;cloudname&lt;span class="o"&gt;]&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;[&lt;/span&gt;machine-0&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;name&lt;span class="o"&gt;]&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class="k"&gt;for&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;example:
$&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;juju&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;bootstrap&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;devx&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;test-1
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This will create a state controller (machine-0) that will be the
management node within juju's cloud environment.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;Develop a new provider&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Case in point is to develop a new provider. Juju's &lt;a href="https://github.com/juju/juju/wiki/Implementing-environment-providers"&gt;document&lt;/a&gt; is
helpful to …&lt;/p&gt;</description><dc:creator xmlns:dc="http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/">Feng Xia</dc:creator><pubDate>Wed, 11 Jan 2017 17:00:00 -0500</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">tag:fengxia41103.github.io,2017-01-11:/myblog/juju bootstrap.html</guid><category>openstack</category><category>lenovo</category></item><item><title>Juju charm model</title><link>https://fengxia41103.github.io/myblog/juju%20charm%20model.html</link><description>&lt;p&gt;This article is a high level view of Juju's internal modelings. For me
it was fairly confusing when looking at its document which has an army
of these concepts: charm, bundle, model, unit.... of course, each of
them makes sense after a while. Its &lt;a href="https://jujucharms.com/docs/2.0/glossary"&gt;terminology&lt;/a&gt; page helps on
understanding individual term. But like other Canonical documents, it
needs a design level diagram to help user grasp the structure of this
wealth of knowledge.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So here it is my attemp to show the relationship between these
terms. Instead of drawing a tree to reflect 1-N relationship, I used
an outer enclosure which can have multiple of its inner enclosures,
eg. a bundle can have N charms.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;figure class="s12 center"&gt;
  &lt;img src="images/juju%20control%20modeling.png"/&gt;
  &lt;figcaption&gt;Juju control models&lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A few interesting points besides the 1-N relationships. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;A single application can be deployed on multiple machines,
  eg. Application #2 has two units. This is how one application can be
  scaled out horizontally.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;One machine, in turn, can host multiple applications, eg. one unit
  of application #2 and #3 both live on the same machine.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;By default …&lt;/p&gt;</description><dc:creator xmlns:dc="http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/">Feng Xia</dc:creator><pubDate>Tue, 03 Jan 2017 10:45:00 -0500</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">tag:fengxia41103.github.io,2017-01-03:/myblog/juju charm model.html</guid><category>openstack</category><category>lenovo</category></item><item><title>Targets in MAAS lab</title><link>https://fengxia41103.github.io/myblog/maas%20target.html</link><description>&lt;p&gt;After setting up the MAAS server and its subnet, bringing up a target
node is simple.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;All nodes must be on the same &lt;strong&gt;192.168.8.0/24&lt;/strong&gt; subnet, and
they must support PXE boot.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;PXE boot&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The MAAS machine functions as both the DHCP server and the TFTP
server, both are required to facilitate PXE booting. First, we creat a
blank VM. The important things are:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Under &lt;em&gt;System &amp;rarr; Mother board &amp;rarr; Boot order&lt;/em&gt;, check the
    &lt;em&gt;Network&lt;/em&gt;. However, it is not necessary to move the &lt;em&gt;Network&lt;/em&gt; boot
    above &lt;em&gt;Hard Disk&lt;/em&gt;. When there is no OS deployed yet on the hard
    disk, boot process will fall through to PXE anyway. Once an OS has
    been installed, the machine will boot normally from HD.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you put PXE as the first order, this target will not boot
into HD image at all.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Set &lt;em&gt;Network &amp;rarr; Adapter 1 &amp;rarr; Internal Network&lt;/em&gt;, named
    &lt;em&gt;intnet&lt;/em&gt;. This corresponds to the MAAS managed subnet of
    192.168.8.0/24.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After this, start the target VM and it should PXE boot and will shut
itself …&lt;/p&gt;</description><dc:creator xmlns:dc="http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/">Feng Xia</dc:creator><pubDate>Fri, 09 Dec 2016 22:00:00 -0500</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">tag:fengxia41103.github.io,2016-12-09:/myblog/maas target.html</guid><category>openstack</category><category>lenovo</category></item><item><title>Setup a MAAS Virtualbox lab</title><link>https://fengxia41103.github.io/myblog/maas%20virtualbox.html</link><description>&lt;p&gt;Canonical &lt;a href="http://maas.io/"&gt;MAAS&lt;/a&gt; is a deployment tool that can give a bare metal
life by putting an OS on it. Working together with &lt;a href="https://www.ubuntu.com/cloud/juju"&gt;Juju&lt;/a&gt;, they can
setup a cluster of applications quite quickly. Think of them as a
package manage like Ubuntu's &lt;code&gt;apt-get&lt;/code&gt;, but in the context of a
cloud. Interesting.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This article shows how to setup a virtual lab so one can play with
these two tools and get a sense of what they do. The whole setup is
based on Virtualbox. One thing I found out the hard way is that
despite their nice looking website and rather recent project history,
there is no single document that can bring this environment live from
A to Z. All official documents have out-of-date commands here and
there which made following them useless. I consulted countless blogs,
posts, chasing down bugs (or I thought they were bugs), and finally
when everything works, it became so obvious and simple. Hopefully this
article will shorten this journey for readers and they can have this
environment easily.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The joy of making graphs in a data-driven web application has been the
highlight that kept me going from project to project. Once all things
are hooked up and data can be created in a meaningful way, the
ultimate presentation are &lt;em&gt;reports&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;graphs&lt;/em&gt;. In most cased, I
have found graphs are far better than reports &amp;mdash; reports often
fall into a table form which looks impressive because it is filled
with data. But who is to the analysis and draw a conclusion!?  On the
other hand, graph, even using the same data set as that of the
report/table, is one step closer to a conclusive message &amp;mdash; KPI
is above or below threshold, department A is doing better than
department B, sales of this month dropped comparing to last month's...&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Car leasing rooted in my own experience while researching for a new
car.  After putting together an Excel to model the car leasing
process, I started to think how to make the lesson learned available
for other buyers. Also, I figure this is a perfect candidate for a
single page application (SPA).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Two versions have been created &amp;mdash; one in &lt;a href="https://angularjs.org/"&gt;Angular&lt;/a&gt;, and another
in &lt;a href="https://facebook.github.io/react/docs/getting-started.html"&gt;REACT&lt;/a&gt;. This ties to my belief that however wonderful a tool may
be, it is also important how well it fits &lt;em&gt;your way of thinking and
typing&lt;/em&gt;. So this project gives a case to evaluate which one I'd like
to invest into for more development.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;Leasing deciphered&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Sad reality is, all the leverages one can pull in a car leasing deal
have been made &lt;em&gt;intentionally&lt;/em&gt; complicated so to confuse
buyers. Jargon are everywhere, and everything is connected so one
number changed seems to be changing everything, and some changes are
more significant than others. How could one to figure out which is
which!?&lt;/p&gt;

that. Instead, vanilla message broker such as Redis or RabbitMQ is
used and is deployed on a separate EC2 instance.  In general I tend to
have concerns over investing a critical system component to a 3rd
party service because they usually will introduce some customization
quirks that make it a real pain when migrating to another service
provider or platform later on. I have not run into such problem with
AWS, but would like to keep options open.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Notice that I do not have multiple database in the diagram. First of
all, I have not had use of DB cluster. Secondly, database replica is
covered by AWS snapshot which has been a great fail-safe tool for
system backup and recovery.  This brings up an important point I'd
like to …&lt;/p&gt;</description><dc:creator xmlns:dc="http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/">Feng Xia</dc:creator><pubDate>Fri, 09 Sep 2016 23:05:00 -0400</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">tag:fengxia41103.github.io,2016-09-09:/myblog/deployment architecture.html</guid><category>dev</category><category>dev</category></item><item><title>General system architecture</title><link>https://fengxia41103.github.io/myblog/general%20system%20architecture.html</link><description>&lt;figure class="col l6 m6 s12"&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The word "system architect" has been puzzling to me.  I was hired to
be one at one point. But it was not a comfortable position. How much
do we understand the business?  What is the problem we are to solve?
How does the current "architecture" fail? What is the downfall of this
(or any) proposal? Overall, I feel an architecture emerges along with
development and research. The more we start to understand the client's
needs, habits, workflows, relationships, priorities, the more
information we have when evaluating and making decisions on whether
one piece in the stack fits or not, and why so. It is, IMHO, a
backwards process when an architecture is pre-defined as if it is set
in stone. We need to start from somewhere, but keeping in mind that it
evolves and shifts like a living organ.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;System architecture evolves and shifts like a living organ.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is a system architecture I have been using recently in
projects. It is divided into four components:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;

site. But like any software engineer who hold a high standard to his
work, I got turned off by all the &lt;a href="http://www.pelicanthemes.com/)"&gt;available themes&lt;/a&gt;.  "Ugly",
"Where is the document?", "Why my translation is not shown?", I felt
running in a maze where there were reflections of exit everywhere, but
none was real. "Well, if it's in Python, we can make one." Solution is
that simple.  Besides, we love &lt;a href="http://jinja.pocoo.org/docs/dev/"&gt;Jinja2&lt;/a&gt; template systems, and
Pelican has spelled out &lt;a href="http://docs.getpelican.com/en/3.6.3/themes.html#templates-and-variables"&gt;everything&lt;/a&gt; we need.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Quickly we wrote down a few on wish list:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The design must be based on &lt;a href="http://getbootstrap.com/components/"&gt;Bootstrap&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Includes &lt;a href="http://fontawesome.io/icons/"&gt;Fontawesome&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://datatables.net/"&gt;Datatable&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="http://lokeshdhakar.com/projects/lightbox2/"&gt;Lightbox2&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href="http://alexgorbatchev.com/SyntaxHighlighter/"&gt;SyntaxHighlighter&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Reuse elements I have designed for &lt;a href="https://fengxia41103.github.io/myblog/demo.html"&gt;showcases&lt;/a&gt;, such as layout, CSS and images.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Colors we like: &lt;font color="#337ab7"&gt;blue(#337ab7)&lt;/font&gt; and &lt;span class="myhighlight"&gt;red(#d52349)&lt;/span&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="https://fonts.google.com/"&gt;Google fonts&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The actual work was pretty straightforward. Follow Pelican official document
to set up a working directory:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="highlight"&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;code&gt;├──&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;static

noticing is the slowness when ODOO first boot up.  We are observing up
to minutes of a bootup time. This plainly is too slow.  Watching debug
prints indicates that ODOO scans through all modules listed on Python
path and builds a &lt;em&gt;map&lt;/em&gt; in memory before dev server starts responding
to request. Intuitively I suspected such loading practice is causing
an unnecessary delay.  This aggravates further when ODOO server
becomes completly unusable if any of the module chokes during this
loading process. But this is too common a scenario during
development. One consequence of this is that debugging becomes
difficult. Often enough ODOO doesn't yield useful trace track to help
determine the root cause of an error.  Another problem of such
approach is the availability of servic becoming binary &amp;mdash; it
either fully works or nothing runs. By analogy, the ODOO loading
process is like compiling phase in running a C code. No executable is
available until the compiler and linker are happy.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Under this light …&lt;/p&gt;</description><dc:creator xmlns:dc="http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/">Feng Xia</dc:creator><pubDate>Sat, 23 Jul 2016 00:00:00 -0400</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">tag:fengxia41103.github.io,2016-07-23:/myblog/odoo8 server loading process.html</guid><category>odoo</category><category>odoo</category></item><item><title>Buildbot continuous integration setup</title><link>https://fengxia41103.github.io/myblog/buildbot.html</link><description>&lt;p&gt;The whole point of quick development cycle is to shorten
the path between a verbal or written requirement, and an actionable
application that reflects an implementation of this requirement. Therefore,
it becomes crucial to set up an CI environment not only to facilitate
development and testing, but to enforce our practice of agile prototyping
by setting up a complete automated test instance for our clients that closely
mirrors development progress. Once achieved, clients and developers can now
truely accalaim that they are &lt;em&gt;on the same page&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;Buildbot&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We chose &lt;a href="http://buildbot.net/"&gt;buildbot&lt;/a&gt; as our CI tool.
Another common choice is the &lt;a href="https://jenkins.io/"&gt;jenkins&lt;/a&gt;. Jenkins
is in Java. So in order to maintain a technology stack as consistent as
we can, we opted to buildbot for this purpose.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Installation&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Create a python virtualenv and use pip is all it takes:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="highlight"&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;code&gt;$&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;workon&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;build
$&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;pip&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;install&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;buildbot
$&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;pip&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;install&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;buildbot-slave
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For configuration, you can refer to&lt;/p&gt;

for more details.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On our test server, I have set the paths to:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;master: ~/build-master&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;slave: ~/build-slave&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;a href="https://fengxia41103.github.io/myblog/fashion orders.html"&gt;part two&lt;/a&gt;, we have
reviewed inventory management and order management. Their functions
are meant for operator to book-keep information of daily operations.
Once these data points have been captured, the power of the application
shines in term of data analysis and reporting.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Reports can be grouped into three categories:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;span class="myhighlight"&gt;reports at product level&lt;/span&gt;: top
   seller, top purchased, top profitable&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;span class="myhighlight"&gt;reports at order level&lt;/span&gt;: top SO by
   qty balance, top SO in-progress fulfills&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;span class="myhighlight"&gt;reports of seller/buyer account
   level&lt;/span&gt;: customer AR, vendor AP&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Data points are essentially rolled up following this pattern: product level &amp;rarr; order level
&amp;rarr; account level.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;Product level reports&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Top selling product&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Knowing the top seller is the most important thing for any business.
The report is compiled from sales orders to show which product is high in demand.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;figure&gt;
    &lt;img class="center img-responsive" src="images/fashion_19.png"&gt;
    &lt;figcaption&gt;Top seller report&lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Top profitable product&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Your best seller shows the demand, but they are not necessarily
the best for your business if their margin is low. Instead, a high margin
item may be the target that your next market campaign …&lt;/p&gt;</description><dc:creator xmlns:dc="http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/">Feng Xia</dc:creator><pubDate>Sun, 12 Jun 2016 10:00:00 -0400</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">tag:fengxia41103.github.io,2016-06-12:/myblog/fashion reports.html</guid><category>fashion</category><category>fashion</category></item><item><title>Fashion ERP — orders</title><link>https://fengxia41103.github.io/myblog/fashion%20orders.html</link><description>&lt;p&gt;In &lt;a href="https://fengxia41103.github.io/myblog/fashion introduction.html"&gt;part one&lt;/a&gt; I have
shown the design and function behind Product and Inventory management.
In this article I'll talk about orders.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Sales order and purchase order are like two sides of the same coin.
Each sales order(SO) can include a mixed bag of products from
different vendors. Once a SO has been created, application will parse
it into multiple purchase order (PO) and route them to their
vendor. Reversely, company can place a PO with a vendor, and purchased
products can be used to fulfill multiple sales orders later.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;Order life cycle&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To understand the design of orders, one has to first grasp the life
cycle of an order. I'd like to divide its functions into roughly two
areas: &lt;em&gt;about physical good&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;about money&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The area of physical goods takes care of the acquisition of products
on order. This includes shipping, receiving, reconciliation,
inventory, product return and substitution. Like what we did in
inventory, we maintain a theoretical list which comes from the sales
order itself (think of it as a wish …&lt;/p&gt;</description><dc:creator xmlns:dc="http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/">Feng Xia</dc:creator><pubDate>Mon, 06 Jun 2016 10:00:00 -0400</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">tag:fengxia41103.github.io,2016-06-06:/myblog/fashion orders.html</guid><category>fashion</category><category>fashion</category></item><item><title>Fashion ERP — introduction</title><link>https://fengxia41103.github.io/myblog/fashion%20introduction.html</link><description>&lt;p&gt;Project Fashion is an ERP system built from ground up based on
operations in an international trading company who has a specialty in
fashion products. Each season there are between 10 and 20 vendors and
a few thousand new SKUs. Most vendors roll out new designs twice per
year &amp;mdash; spring/summer season and fall/winter season. Some may
have new products every month. To keep track of these products and
keep up with vendor's schedule have been the primarily challenge this
coompany has.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The system's role, therefore, is to replace previously paper-based
operations with now an online version so that product catelogue can be
centrally maintained, and multiple subsidaries who are geographically
separated can coordinate sales, purchase and inventory, and upper
management can receive instant up-to-date reports and the ability to
drill down to SKU level details when needed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Unlike a full blown ERP, a decision was made during design to remove
complexity so user and customer can operate with little training.
Configurable UI and workflow were scratched off. Instead, hard coded
workflow and accurate …&lt;/p&gt;</description><dc:creator xmlns:dc="http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/">Feng Xia</dc:creator><pubDate>Thu, 02 Jun 2016 10:00:00 -0400</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">tag:fengxia41103.github.io,2016-06-02:/myblog/fashion introduction.html</guid><category>fashion</category><category>fashion</category></item><item><title>Project Fashion Demo</title><link>https://fengxia41103.github.io/myblog/project%20fashion%20demo.html</link><description>&lt;figure class="s12 center"&gt;

&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Project Fashion is built to support daily business of an international
trading company who specializes fashion products. Main functions of
the application include product management, customer and vendor
database, order management (both sales and purchase), and inventory
management.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The company is based in US with two subsidiaries in mainland China.
Its challenges lied in multiple folds. First, orders and updates are emailed
back and forth which is error prone and can be quickly out of sync with
reality. Second, operation becomes
unaccountable when critical data points are missing, eg. who made
the last modification 2of a sales order? Third, vendors are operating
in Europe and North America time zones while the company's customers
are in China. The time difference and geographical separation between
the two ends make information flow difficult without a centrally maintained
information repository. Cloud drives were tried but still they
lack the capability to provide a coherent view for both sides.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On top of these issues, the company was to launch an initiative
to …&lt;/p&gt;</description><dc:creator xmlns:dc="http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/">Feng Xia</dc:creator><pubDate>Sun, 06 Mar 2016 09:00:00 -0500</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">tag:fengxia41103.github.io,2016-03-06:/myblog/project fashion demo.html</guid><category>demo</category></item><item><title>GKP — major details</title><link>https://fengxia41103.github.io/myblog/gkp%20majors.html</link><description>&lt;p&gt;In &lt;a href="https://fengxia41103.github.io/myblog/gkp introduction.html"&gt;part one&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://fengxia41103.github.io/myblog/gkp schools.html"&gt;part
two&lt;/a&gt;, I have introduced functions
to assist students get to know about the schools from multiple
aspects. In this article, we will touch upon another important factor
when going to college &amp;mdash; major.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In China, majors are split into three layers: category, subcategory,
and majors. Similar to the &lt;em&gt;state-city-school&lt;/em&gt; configuration,
functions at category and subcategory level focus on statistic
analysis so to offer an overview, where major level contains details
that are relevant to that particular major which students would find
useful.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;figure class="s12 center"&gt;
    &lt;img src="images/gkp_major_setup.png"/&gt;
    &lt;figcaption&gt;Majors are split into 3 layers&lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;According to &lt;a href="https://fengxia41103.github.io/myblog/downloads/20121012084054830.pdf"&gt;document&lt;/a&gt;
published by the &lt;a href="http://www.moe.gov.cn/publicfiles/business/htmlfiles/moe/s3882/201210/xxgk_143152.html"&gt;Department of Education&lt;/a&gt; in 2012, there are 12
categories, 92 subcategories and 506 majors.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;Category and subcategory&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At this level, focus was to provide statistics which is similar to
what is done for schools at &lt;em&gt;State level&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;figure class="s12 center"&gt;
    &lt;img src="images/gkp_18.png"/&gt;
    &lt;figcaption&gt;Major category and subcategory&lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Students can quickly browse through category and subcategory to locate
area of interest she wants to drill further down.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;Major&lt;/h1&gt;

introduced functions that will help school
research at nation level, state and city level. In this article
I'll talk about features built to help research at &lt;em&gt;school level&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;Bookmark&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While research schools, it is useful to bookmark a page for later
use. That's where the &lt;em&gt;bookmark&lt;/em&gt; feature comes in. User can save
unlimited bookmarks and manage them by &lt;em&gt;x-out&lt;/em&gt;(remove) it from saved
list. Convenient.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;figure class="row"&gt;
    &lt;div class="col s6"&gt;
    &lt;img class="img-responsive center" src="images/gkp_9.png" /&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="col s6"&gt;
    &lt;img class="img-responsive center" src="images/gkp_10.png" /&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
    &lt;figcaption&gt;Bookmark a school&lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;h1&gt;School summary&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;School summary are mostly text extracted from multiple sources.  The
first page contains an introduction, or a quick view, of the school.
It contains many meta data that can be extracted to form more data
dimensions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;figure class="s12 center"&gt;
    &lt;img src="images/gkp_11.png"/&gt;
    &lt;figcaption&gt;School summary&lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;School detail page expands on top of the introduction. One small feature
concerning development is that TOC is auto generated.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;figure class="s12 center"&gt;
    &lt;img  src="images/gkp_12.png"/&gt;
    &lt;figcaption&gt;School wiki&lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;h1&gt;Historical admission scores&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This page lists historical cutoff scores that the school has applied
in past admissions. GKP has collected over 2,000,000 data records
between 2010 and 2014 and covering 3,000 schools.&lt;/p&gt;

Mr.Zhang, back in Jan, 2015.  Mr.Zhang has been in China's college
education business for 15 year. He has succeeded in building a couple
online training services and is also the head of a private
college. The GKP project is to consolidate multiple data sources into
one place so to facilitate high school graduates and their parents
searching and evaluating college and university.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In this article I'll give a brief introduction of core functions and
thoughts behind each design. It also illustrates how we have
approached each problem with the solution you are currently seeing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;User preference&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;An important tool is the &lt;code&gt;user preference&lt;/code&gt;. Each user can specify her own
searching criteria so to narrow down from a general search to a more
customized version.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;figure class="s12 center"&gt;
    &lt;img src="images/gkp_2.png" /&gt;
    &lt;figcaption&gt;Set up user preferences&lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;These settings are related directly to how Chinese college categorize
students. Take the &lt;strong&gt;Geo requirement&lt;/strong&gt; setting for example.  Let's say
that MIT takes 3,000 freshmen each year. Instead of accepting
application nation …&lt;/p&gt;</description><dc:creator xmlns:dc="http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/">Feng Xia</dc:creator><pubDate>Fri, 04 Sep 2015 10:00:00 -0400</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">tag:fengxia41103.github.io,2015-09-04:/myblog/gkp introduction.html</guid><category>gkp</category><category>gkp</category></item><item><title>Project Stock Backtesting Demo</title><link>https://fengxia41103.github.io/myblog/project%20stock%20demo.html</link><description>&lt;figure class="s12 center"&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This project started at lunch with a friend who has been trading
stocks as hobby for years. None of us has worked in a trading house
playing with some serious money. Nonetheless, he believed that he has
found a winner strategy and I felt there is only one way to prove it
&amp;mdash; data and test.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So here it is, a tool that can test a trading strategy over S&amp;amp;P 500
daily data and a few other data sets. The cool thing about this
application is that simulation is done as background process and
report has not only statistics compared against some index such as the
S&amp;amp;P 500, but a detailed step-by-step transaction trace that is ready
for a replay.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The bad news is that his winner strategy doesn't seem to be a winner
yet.  The good news is that we now have a framework that can host much
more data set and strategies, and running data set in this scale is
fun.&lt;/p&gt;</description><dc:creator xmlns:dc="http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/">Feng Xia</dc:creator><pubDate>Thu, 06 Aug 2015 15:00:00 -0400</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">tag:fengxia41103.github.io,2015-08-06:/myblog/project stock demo.html</guid><category>demo</category></item><item><title>Project GKP Demo</title><link>https://fengxia41103.github.io/myblog/project%20gkp%20demo.html</link><description>&lt;figure class="s12 center"&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Project GKP is an interesting one.  It is a web tool that helps high
school graduates in China to find a right college.  The grand vision
is to make it a one-stop shop to get information that are mostly
relevant at each step of research.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When we first conceived this idea, the leader in this field was a
Chinese startup company, &lt;a href="http://www.gaokaopi.com/"&gt;高考派&lt;/a&gt;(aka. GKP). It was rumored that
the company was facing a pending acquisition with a enticing price
tag. After diving into their site for a few weeks, we came to realize
that beneath the skin of their application, its baseline data was
seriously broken. For example, GKP's core feature was its historical
exam data. However, we found a dozen similar sources all claimed to
have the same data set. But surprisingly there have been hard reached
to find agreement between any of the two data sets! This cast a
serious doubt on the validity of these services. Further analysis of
them made …&lt;/p&gt;</description><dc:creator xmlns:dc="http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/">Feng Xia</dc:creator><pubDate>Fri, 06 Mar 2015 09:00:00 -0500</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">tag:fengxia41103.github.io,2015-03-06:/myblog/project gkp demo.html</guid><category>demo</category></item><item><title>Crawler, TOR, and be a good web citizen</title><link>https://fengxia41103.github.io/myblog/tor%20crawler.html</link><description>&lt;p&gt;Many projects I have done involved harvesting data from
public sites. Data crawling is an exciting business. On one hand, it
is easy to develop a crawler these days. In the Python world,
plenty tutorials will show you how to build
a simple crawler using the &lt;a href="https://docs.python.org/2/library/urllib.html"&gt;Python urllib&lt;/a&gt;,
or building upon some more sophisticate tool like
&lt;a href="http://doc.scrapy.org/en/latest/intro/tutorial.html"&gt;Scrapy&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;figure class="s12 center"&gt;
  &lt;img src="images/regular_expressions.png"/&gt;
  &lt;figcaption&gt;Fun with regular expression&lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But before carried away by the fun and the power,
let's lay down a ground rule &amp;mdash; to respect
 peer server and try hard being a good web citizen.
We surely learned a few lessons here. So please
take notes and hopefully you won't fall into the same pit.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;Banned&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We used to joke about this &amp;mdash; if you haven't been banned by a server,
you haven't hit it hard enough. Well, we were banned.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Our first version was a simple urllib based agent and could be run
in multiprocessing mode. Target was a public site run
by a small startup firm, which by rumor consisted mostly of
developers, too. So we took this on almost …&lt;/p&gt;</description><dc:creator xmlns:dc="http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/">Feng Xia</dc:creator><pubDate>Wed, 04 Mar 2015 13:00:00 -0500</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">tag:fengxia41103.github.io,2015-03-04:/myblog/tor crawler.html</guid><category>dev</category><category>dev</category></item></channel></rss>
