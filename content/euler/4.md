# solution

[code][2].

- **problem space**: `100*100 &mdash; 999*999`
- **test criteria**: is [palindromic][3]? (see [problem 36][4] for a
  cool trick on palindromic test).


Take the brute force way:

```python
import itertools


def is_palindromic(n):
    """Test n to be palindromic number.

    The easiest way, I think, is to convert "n" to
    string and test its reverse == itself.
    """
    string_version = str(n)
    return ''.join(reversed(string_version)) == string_version


def main():
    matrix = set(itertools.imap(
        lambda (x, y): x * y, itertools.combinations(range(100, 999), 2)))
    results = filter(lambda x: is_palindromic(x), matrix)
    print max(results)
```

A couple thoughts for improvement:

1. this will build an in memory `set` with all possible combinations
   of 2 numbers in `range(100,999)`. This is ok when problem space is
   limited. What if the upper bound is 1 million times greater?
2. Another thought is that product of the two numbers specified in the
   problem range will generate quite some redundant results,
   eg. `100*300 = 150*200`.
