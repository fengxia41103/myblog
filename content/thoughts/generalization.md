I have been thinking, is generalization good, or bad, or inevitable? I
kinda of wonder that looking at something, especially something new,
in a generalized term, is actually inevitable. Watching Noah learning
things since young, he has to generalize things in order to recognize
anything &mdash; this is a dog, that is a cat. Over the weekend I got
a few mosquito bites which annoyed me to hell. Then I was thinking
about the book I picked up last week, something about the history of
Malaria, which to many runs that mosquito is spreading virus, thus if
we could eliminate mosquito entirely (as a specie), then we are good.

Well, then I was thinking, among that gazillion mosquitoes, are we now
just  viewing ALL  of them  as a  single identity,  a unified  blob of
living thing with a set of common  traits, and how many of us have any
idea how many  mosquitoes out there!? I bet there  are many. Then, how
many among  them are  actually the  cause Malaria?   I don't  know.  I
challenge anyone around  me knows that. Then, we human  being view ALL
of them an enemy in a bio  warfare, and targeting to kill them all (at
least on a conceptual level. I  think the biologist who are developing
human side of the weaponry actually do have some idea of which type of
mosquito is good & which is bad.)  S case in point, this is exactly we
can comprehend things,  anything, because our capacity  simply can not
incorporate all  the details in order  to track and distinguish  at an
individual  level. Therefore,  the  only way  to  build a  "knowledge"
(quote on purpose) is to generalize.

This  same  is happening  actually  in  my  work.  When I'm  proud  of
_building a data model_ through analysis,  I always thought in term of
_attributes_ so that a set of  attributes become a representation of a
thing &mdash; a car, a user, a server. These are data models, and they
are abstracts which **approximate** the  real thing, but will never be
as real as the real thing, because  we know from the beginning that we
are not going to,  and simply can not (and I mean  this not because we
are  lazy, but  we  do NOT  have the  tool  &mdash; language,  syntax,
methodology, to describe them in an OVERALL fashion! Honestly, I don't
know what such a description will look like in my wildest dream!  It's
just   beyond  me   at   this  moment!)   include   all  details   and
possibilities. Thus,  a model is,  as I  have always said,  a personal
view, an opinion if you will, of  this thing &mdash; I many abstract a
car into a shell, 4 wheels, a steering wheel, and so forth; but we all
know that first  of all, kids always  don't view car in such  a way at
the  beginning  (eventually they  conform  w/  our views,  but  that's
completely drilled into their head by us, not their organic view). And
secondly,  this  exactly  abstract  of  a  car  becomes  a  force  our
imagination has  to battle in  order to  _think outside the  box_! Why
does car have to  have 4 wheels? or wheels at  all?... a dominant view
becomes a convention, a convention becomes a rule, a rule becomes both
a guide that has proven to work, and a cat who constantly patrolls its
territory  looking  for  intrusion  to fight  off  &larr;  this  isn't
inspired by some dark human nature. This  is logic, and I can see this
logic has played in the past, is  playing now, and will play again and
again and again,  in different forms and spaces and  contexts, but the
same logic, over and over.

But  then, such  abstract, which  =  learning =  knowledge, is  really
problematic,  and this  is tightly  related to  technology. NPR  talks
about policy  uses _profiling_  (based on  data analysis)  to identify
candidates to monitor, who essentially is said (by algorithm!) to have
higher probability to commit a crime. Well, this is easily understood,
from both  a conventional  wisdom point  of view  and a  data analysis
POV.  What comes  into  the  play is  the  word  `history` (or  `track
record`) &rarr;  if you have  done wrong in the  past, you may  have a
certain traits stronger than other people's, and these traits are more
likely to get you in a situation  that law defines as a crime &larr; a
quick  temper,  a  violent   history,  or  even  single-parent  family
background,   low-education,   drug  taking,   and   so   on  and   so
forth. Actually most people will agree that such statistics do support
these claims.  But if  so, what about  individual!? what  about having
opportunity to correct what was wrong? what about **not discriminating
somebody** by just putting on a label?  I mean, how do we know we have
stamped a label  too liberally that it has not  becomes a bias against
somebody without a cause or foundation?

But then, without using a label, how do we learn!? The entire so
called science and technology is built upon this method of
abstraction. This is how we can ever simplify the world in a way so
that we can study and comprehend. Otherwise, it will the Go game or
any of the so-called ancient Chinese art form, martial art included,
that we have to count on some odd historical genius to advance it,
because its value lies in its _entire format_, so it can not be broken
down, be analytically deciphered, thus hard to teach and to share
knowledge, and impossible to replicate.

I think human is caught in a dilemma. I don't believe there is
solution. Therefore, the struggle between abstracting into a common
theme versus calling to treat individual _equally_ will continue to
exist without a solution. This then gives a perfect excuse (if they
are actually smart because they consciously manipulated this leverage
to their advantage) or just plainly a side-effect, that discrimination
based on race, gender, education, family tie, whatever (and these are
just labels!), is truly an inherited consequence of the nature of human
recognition. If we think they are evil deeds (which I believe they
are), we have to watch ourselves, and remind ourselves how we have
created them in the first place, like creating a child, you can't just
walk away &rarr; you can be irresponsible by not raising her, but the
biological bond is forever true, and you can't deny it.

But when I look at my mosquito bites, I still don't them at all, in a
most general way, with a most general label &rarr; and if I cannot
overcome this, how would I know I won't apply this same flaw on other
things, things that can cause harm to other human, friend or foe!?

As a member of human, I feel powerless.
