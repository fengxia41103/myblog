Sitting in the dark and listening to these music, watching the night
outside the window, flashing nights on the building far away, a few
cars running on the road at this hour, a cold cold winter night. I
miss dad & Lei, miss 猪娃娃, miss the days in Shenzhen, miss the time of
laughing, of talking, of coffeeing early in the morning, of playing
arcades, of window shopping, of watching the water fountain dancing w/
the music, of the crowd around, of the chess game at Nanshan, sitting
on bench watching the city below, of thinking of days passed, of the
people missed, of the life ahead, of the time behind. What a journey a
life is! I don't know how to tread this path well, or better, or
worse, each step seems permanent, uncertain at best, hardly there were
a few moments in life when I knew exactly what to do next &mdash; like
going home to put dad to rest. And even then, these moments were
always linked to something, sad. For the rest of life, it's just
taking each step w/ a roll of dice, sometimes lucky, sometimes not,
like dancing on a thin ice, feeling to sink at any moment, yet coasted
along when the ground magically held. Fate, destiny, God's
will. Nothing is in my control, yet I have to play the main role as if
I could decide the script. How strange.

Dad would like this music. She would, too. Zhu would not care
much. But I do. How I wish the living things I care about could be all
nearby, that I could see, could hear, could feel the warmth of their
body, feel the life inside them.. yet, one by one, they have left my
life, leaving me in this cold winter night, all alone. Though there
are so much I want to say and talk about, there is only the dark night
outside the window, pretty to look at, lights flashing on the building
far away.

What's the purpose of this life? any? I don't know. I will miss the
music, if I were now on a death bed. I will miss the beautiful beings,
a cat, a flower, a cloud, a sunset, a song, a smile, a coffee w/
friend, w/ one I love, a walk in Tokyo, a ride in train, a moment in a
temple, a visit to the Fine Arts, a bike ride on the Charles... these
are beauties in this world, they, make this journey worth
coming. Suddenly thought of the college days. Felt so far away, yet,
the young man is right here, in front of my eyes, how did he get to,
here? How did he become, the me, right here, now? What did he do over
these years, and how did he do? It's flashing by like a movie, seems
something had been captured, and replayed, but there is nothing there,
maybe a wish? Barely anything left. The past, forever, passed. This
movie has not yet stopped, and can't roll back. What's next? I don't
know. How will this movie end? It's not that interesting at all.

Music flows by. A cold cold winter night, this is already too good
to be true.
