You wouldn't believe where I am writing this right now! I'm sitting at
this square by the subway station on my way back to my place after yet
another full day visiting my Dad and another relative, and here are
like hundreds of people square dancing, with the loud, rythmatic music
and cold air, and subway train running by the high rise bridge with
its own sound, fascinating experience!

I used to look down on these square dancers, thinking that they are
pretty loser by being entertained by such poor taste in public
space. However, I was having a different feeling this time. As a
matter of fact, I'm having a different feeling about a lot of things
this time in Shanghai &mdash; at the beginning I contributed it to the
terrible cold I caught which made me really dizzy together w/ jet
lag. But I think there is another reason &mdash; not that I'm getting
older, but that after watching my Dad and others slipping into the
valley of their life, I start to accept uncertainty of life, the poor
reward it gives you, and respect whoever could still hold his/her head
high after a touch life, like these square dancers who are enjoying
themselves without much bothered by bystanders and their opinions
&mdash; they just turn on the loud speakers, inventing a step that
matches the music, twist the body, arms, legs, jumping up and down,
sometimes lost a beat or two, but nonetheless, they are quite, happy.

Also, I think there is another thing about them which just occurred to
me &mdash; why this activity makes them, happy?  I wonder whether
Chinese, of these groups of Chinese, only feel safe when they find
themselves belong to a group? Like a herd of lamb, they have to have a
social role that is part of a group so that they feel, even though
they may not admit, settled. I wonder that. I don't know, but that's a
strong feeling when watching these people over there. Does this
explain why there are such a strong tendency for Chinese people to be
fooled in a mass scale, by politicians, by lairs, or by
technologists who sell their pills dressed in buzz words? I feel
so. 

But then, human are social animals. I'm probably an odd ball in term
that I do play well w/ social norms, when I choose so, just that I'm
always feeling like an outsiders peeking into a glass tank of
reptiles.... you know, this is really weird, that an airplane just
passed above, but its engine sound is almost drowned by the loud
speakers nearby, so that, what used to be annoyance for any American
residents whose house is below the air trail, has no effect here
whatsoever, because you simply can't hear! &rarr; isn't this a
positive side effect or what!... here comes another airplane, again,
I'm watching the green lights approaching, actually not slowly, but
rather quickly, and yet, you can barely notices its existence because
you can't hear it. Fascinating, isn't it!?

Visited 大妈妈 this afternoon. Haven't seen her for, 10 years!?... has
been a long long time. She is 97, and what a woman! She is still young
at heart &mdash; she was making jokes, smiling, and even made a face
to the camera! She is just, funny! I can't help wondering how she was
like when she was young &mdash; was she pretty? was she cute? No doubt
she must be really smart and sharp. What a lively and funny girl she
must have been! Can't imagine it has been 24 years since my college,
and I still remember sitting at her table having meal together, and
she was then, as she is now, an old, tiny lady who was always smiling
and talking this and that.. Yet, she hasn't changed a bit, though she
has lost as much as everyone else over these years, and I only over
heard from 大姐姐 that her life has been a rough one &mdash; but she
was smiling, smiling, making fun w/ you, making fun w/ life, what a
spirit! What a human being! I admire that, cause I won't ever be as
strong as she is; I doubt many can be.

Finally after these many days I started to feel my brain again &larr;
the past few days have been a real daydream for me that I was walking,
talking, doing things, but my brain was just, dead &mdash; I was so
tired, tired from travel, from jet lag, from the cold and
coughs... though the cough is still here, but has been much better
today, and for the first time since landing in Shanghai, I start to
feel that my brain is working, so that I'm now writing this, because
thoughts start to flow again, and my heart starts to feel things
again, something happy, something sad, someone forgotten, someone
recalled, someone I wish I could see again, someone I wish I could
love again, someone I could forever, be aside... Seoul, enjoy ~
