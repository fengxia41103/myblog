Don't take this as an April Fool's trick. Seriously, I'm also alarmed
how I could have changed, a 180 degree turn, from disliking this guy,
Bill Gates, when I was young, to today, I'm taking him as a role
model, and if he runs for president, I'll vote for him.

An [article][1] by him on Corvid-19, simple, precise,
to the point, "Bill Gates: Here’s how to make up for lost time on
covid-19":

> There’s no question the United States missed the opportunity to get

> decisions hasn’t closed. The choices we and our leaders make now
> will have an enormous impact on how soon case numbers start to go
> down, how long the economy remains shut down and how many Americans
> will have to bury a loved one because of covid-19.
> 
> Through my work with the Gates Foundation, I’ve spoken with experts
> and leaders in Washington and across the country. It’s become clear
> to me that we must take three steps.
> 
> First, we need a consistent nationwide approach to shutting
> down. Despite urging from public health experts, some states and
> counties haven’t shut down completely. In some states, beaches are
> still open; in others, restaurants still serve sit-down meals.

> symptomatic people who are most at risk of becoming seriously ill
> and those who are likely to have been exposed.
> 
> The same goes for masks and ventilators. Forcing 50 governors to

> ensure that the first doses go to the people who need them most.
> 
> To bring the disease to an end, we’ll need a safe and effective
> vaccine. If we do everything right, we could have one in less than
> 18 months — about the fastest a vaccine has ever been developed. But
> creating a vaccine is only half the battle. To protect Americans and
> people around the world, we’ll need to manufacture billions of
> doses. (Without a vaccine, developing countries are at even greater
> risk than wealthy ones, because it’s even harder for them to do
> physical distancing and shutdowns.)
> 
> We can start now by building the facilities where these vaccines
> will be made. Because many of the top candidates are made using

With growing age, I guess one does become more experienced and
opinionated because you have been there, have done that, have been
pondering the topic at hand, maybe without a satisfying answer, but
must have witnessed how the debates went, how other opinions aroused
the crowd, how BS has hit the fans, and how time has proven some
right, while others, wrong &larr; so that you learn along the course,
if you had kept your mind open and sensitive, even a bit agitated,
sometimes angry, sometimes applauding.

I remember back then working in Taiyuan, I started watching TED and
started speaking to junior staffs on works by the Gates Foundation,
hoping that one day they will become a member of these initiatives and
contribute their brains to them, because these are hard, much harder,
problems than what we are solving everyday at work &mdash; imagine a
toilet without running water? I challenged them that if they thought
they are smart, try tackle this &mdash; it was a real project posted
on the Foundation's front page, maybe quite unsexy to test (how to
test it!?), but fundamentally more valuable than yet another ERP
system w/ million dollar price tag. Case in point, my friend's
volunteer site has no indoor plumbing, no indoor toilet, well, I
should say no our idea of a toilet at atll! It's a hole in the ground
in the corner of court yard with a couple planks on top where you
squat and let the gravity takes care of the rest. Fun!? Try it in
bitter winter night, or imagine your 4-year old using that without you
holding onto his body or clothes &mdash; what a fear! what a drag!

Yea, so for all the smart folks out there, if you consider yourself a
good engineer, making a living w/ corporate cliche is ok, but don't
let your talent only be occupied by those. Instead, keep the brain
running w/ these types of real life challenges. We living in the US
has been to spoiled to realize that all these life convenience has
been quite recent, quite uncommon, and quite engineering savvy. For
many others, it's not the cost of appliance that kept them in a stone
age mode. It's the lack of basic infrastructure such as a running
water, or electricity, or even a paved road, that make everyday
_business_ a super hard, harder than you think, but once solved, it
benefits many, you don't need to market, no need to brag about its
benefits on pretty PPT, a changing life for the better, is the best
evidence and the best reward.
