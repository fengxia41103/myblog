# solution

[code][2].

* **problem space**: `int < 100`
* **test criteria**: none

This problem involves nothing but math computation. Consider that
problem space is so small, I didnot bother with anything else but went
with brute force:

```python
def main():
    n = 100
    a = sum([i*i for i in range(1,n+1)])
    b = sum(range(1,n+1))
    b = b*b

    print b-a
```
