Today, Uncle Tam left us. Jookun came to join us for breakfast before
Noah and I leave for NYC, then his phone ringed. It was both a
shocker, and expected. It's hard. 谭伯母 called a bit later, talked
some, hard time. Good thing that both daughters are here, so he went
with all his families near by. It's never easy, but this is the best
one could wish for. Thought of scenes playing badminton w/ him in
MIT. Felt like forever ago. Hard to believe, yet, it's the way it is.

Traveling in train for the first time in US in my life. Felt quite
like the one in China. Four hours went by quickly w/ Noah playing
Sanguo. I think he go the hang of it towards the end. Towns passing
by, ocean side at CT, reminded me the drives along the coast when I
was young, single, and enjoying my car. It was good times.

But don't know why. This trip, and regardless where I went, I felt
like a visitor. I couldn't feel I belong to these places anymore. I
feel I'm just traveling, like traveling in China on Dad's trip &mdash;
everywhere was a foreign place to me, both interesting and,
irrelevant. I'm just passing by, and not even feeling of myself, like
a soul walking outside a body, watching the body going through these
physical spaces, experiencing these foods, drinks, scenes, but the
soul is only a bystander, feeling nothing. I don't know why. I think
that, after living in 517 for a year, not only there is few places
that could match the comfort it has, but I start to think that a
lovely space, just like a good looking clothes, doesn't change a thing
in your life, well, I mean, it doesn't solve a thing for you &mdash;
what troubles you remains, the trouble doesn't go away, you are still
just, you, so in the end, all these are just tiny breathing gaps, like
mirages, look super good, but they are not real. So are these travels.

Have to say, walking in Coolidge Corner this morning feels good, nice
neighbourhood, walkable here and there, familiar shops, and
memories. Yet, the memories make the feeling harder when I think of
selling this place for good, like cutting the cord of a baby &mdash;
from this point on, attachment no more, all became past, buried in the
past &larr; I'm gonna miss you, miss this place, miss the myself who
had lived here, walked here, thought this home, thought that nothing
would have changed to the way they are now. Naive, perhaps, but was an
age of innocence.

Bye Uncle Tam. Thank you for playing w/ us. 走好.
