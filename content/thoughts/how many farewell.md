How many farewell one say in a life? With growing age, I found
farewell harder and harder to bear. I remember the time when I saw mom
crying over a TV scene, and couldn't understand why she was so. I
always thought it's just because, women are all like that &mdash;
sensitive, sentimental, cry over any little things that provokes their
feelings.

But. Now at the age, watching yet another TV scene of a Japanese
drama, the kid leaving home to Tokyo w/ big dreams and big future, it
suddenly hit me that, didn't the same happen to me when I was at the
airport waiting for my very first flight in life on my way to Ohio? I
felt excited, nervous, happy, and very little sadness. Yet, mom,
dad... now I start to understand how they had felt then. If fast
forwarding for two years, when Noah is to leave for college, I can see
that now, I can see myself standing there, watching him leave, flying
out of the nest, w/ his big dream, his future, his life, but I would
feel so sad.

I truely wonder, how many farewell one could say in life? how many one
could bear in life? Didn't I say it to her then, wishing a life to
unfold in front of her, just life I will be saying to Noah soon, so to
remove myself from their path to adventure, to enjoy, and perhaps, to
suffer?

When young, I never thought twice saying farewell &mdash; it felt,
light, insignificant, inconsequential, almost bogus, cause we usually
had plenty chances after to meet, to see each other. So a farewell
felt rather like a formality that a young kid is trying to mimic an
adult, yet knowing nothing of its weight. But now, each farewell
feels, heart wrenching, for I learned, a farewell carries so much
hope, so much bless, so much wishful joy, for the one departing, and
so much sadness to cary, for the one staying.

Farewell. Farewell. Maybe there is a fix count of farewells one can
say, each, once said, depletes a part of oneself, till no more. But
sometimes, I felt, one can be allocated too many, that s/he has to
carry that, with each farewell, like a cut, bleeds. It's a bless you
have so many friends, family, ppl you care, who accompany you for long
and for short in life. What you pay as the price, is the pain, the
tear, the sense of loss, the sadness, a deep sigh.
