Bumped into a movie introduction of this wonderful
[documentary/movie][1], "Faces Places". I don't know why. I'm drawn to
human faces. Since now over 17 years ago when I was working at Bit9
and started taking a lot of photos, I had compiled a folder called
`people`, because when I was going through all the shots, I found
myself always had hard time to remove/delete portrait shots &mdash;
somehow, I felt each moment of a person, being it as random and
non-purposeful as most of my shots were, it was still a moment of
life, a moment that s/he and I shared together, like two parallel
lines in space and time, suddenly across once, and only once and never
again.. it's a mysterious feeling. I don't know what it is, and I
certainly lack the art to describe it w/ my word and writing. Maybe
that's why I kept those photos, that an image is worth a thousand
words, maybe, that it has more power than I, to convey the idea, the
feeling. Everytime I looked at a portrait, drawn to the eyes, shining
like a whole galaxy in itself, it is, magical.

And indeed. Like the [Humans in New York][2], I can't help finding
them, wonderful. I know it's a filtered collection of samples, like a
catalog of super models, of course, they are wonderful to look at. But
then, there are also [documentaries][3], yeah I know they are also
edited, but still, the shots moved me deeply. I don't like studio
shots, and in general, I don't like staged shots, touched-up shots,
post-processing, perfect composition, all that... but I like candid
shots, like to look at a random person walking on the street, minding
his/her own business, like sitting behind a glass window watching
people passing by... maybe it's a feeling of a visitor on earth, don't
want to be tangled w/ reality, always want to be immune and
isolated.. hmm.. now to think of this, this actually isn't itself good
at all, and probably even can be called bogus, as if I could stay
above this world... but really, it's a, tendency, I guess, to not be
bounded by some gravity, free spirit? I don't know. It's just part of
me since young, and over all these years, I have been lucky to have
jobs that allow me such flexibility, or to be more accurate, I allowed
myself such freedom whether the boss liked it or not, I couldn't help
it. It's like an urge of hunger inside me, and my mind asked to not be
caged inside, anything.

Back to the film. I wonder why looking at a giant portrait can be so,
touching? I think, it's because a person, as wonderful and complex as
s/he be, is so insignificant and worthless, that they are like sand on
a beach, nobody counts them, nobody tells much of a difference, and
nobody pays attention when they step on them, and when a wave comes
and goes, they are brushed aside, flushed here and there, some went to
the bottom of sea, some moved thousand miles away from "home", some
never saw the light of day... so this is a life of a sand, a
person. But when his/her portrait is taken, is looked at, it's a
statement, a manifesto, of the existence of a complex being, right
there, a claim that "I'm here. I have been here." It's a voice, silent
may it be, but loud and distinct. Each face is an aggregation of all
its entirety of his/her past up to the moment, all the joy, sorrow,
plain, unique.. if shells of sea are beautiful because they are always
different and intricate, here we are, human faces, in the same spirit
of these shells, all different, all intricate, and all strangely
difficult yet pleasant too be looked at.

I don't know. I think the warm feeling of a portrait isn't because of
the subject, perhaps, but really, the act of someone who paid
attention to the person, took his/her photo, and that, is what warms
my heart.. so somewhere, somehow, someone, was finding a life
interesting, finding a person worth a shot, finding a moment worth
saving, and that, is what really touches us. So in the end, it's the
feeling of isolation, of loneliness, that makes us, in the end, human.
