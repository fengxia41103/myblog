I have seen this [book][1] on Reader's Corner's shelf for sometime,
and never felt I should pick it up and read. The book didn't feel like
a kind of book I would like to read, "Personal interviews!?" I thought
ot myself, "that is a common cheap method to get some moving and
touching feeling to reader while the author/cook puts in nothing much
but to collect and compile them." That's my thought, like I always
look down on those army of real estate agents hovering around a condo
complex in China these days &larr; what they do own/contribute!?
anything!? They didn't own the unit, didn't even do much of a homework
to collect information of it. As a matter of fact, many of them
deliberately present you the **wrong** information so they can play a
scheme on you, like hooking you with a couple interesting one, one too
cheap for your budget and one too much over yours, so the strategy
predicts that you will then settle on the next one, the mid-range one,
that he is actually selling, which he already knew since the very
beginning. What the hell.

But then, I bought the book, read it, and felt deeply sad inside. Not
that those personal stories were interesting, probably remote, to my
experience. After all, that's a generation or two of which I had
little sense of, heard only some from my own family accounts through
dad and uncles, and had always felt distant, almost repulsed to
absorb, since that age of darkness was too heavy to think about, too
depressing to dig in, and don't we also secretly believe/hope that it
is not going to happen again anyway, so might as well not to burden
yourself with those information.

But then, there  was a clip or  two, that caught me to  think, to feel
disturbed, to  feel really really sad.  I wish there were  also hope I
felt. But  I have to  say there was much  more sadness than  any other
emotions. It's not a sadness of a lost love or a lost generation or of
their suffering. I can't describe what  it is, it is a profound anger,
perhaps, now to think of it, and  a feeling of sorry for that they had
to twisted and turned  and made the best out of what  they had (or was
given)  so  to survive,  yes,  just  survive, not  flourishing,  just,
survive.

Life is hard, for every single generation. There are always one or two
the _lucky_  ones, but  overall, it  is hard.  So religion  comes into
play, so  is any kind  of thing that gives  you comfort so  to balance
hardship. It's  funny that  even yesterday  when I  dropped Noah  at a
local Chinese church for his first, and mine too, Sunday school, and I
was dragged into a newbie session in which a senior member (I guess he
is, though I  have no clue how  the ranking system works  in a church)
was discussing w/ three  of us (two were a couple  and the woman works
at Lenovo,  too!), and her  question was, religion is  probably needed
because  people need  something  to help  go  through life's  hardtime
&rarr; a psychological need.

On the one hand, I think everybody would just agree w/ her point,
because this is such a universal ask. On the other hand, I also feel
seeking it is then a challenge, if not a impossibility, because there
are so many to choose from (and doesn't each one clams they are the
true one, while others are just plain false!?), but without a
reference, how can one choose? Oh well. I'll leave this to another
discussion later.

Here, I want to jog down a few sections from this book, which, while
reading them, gave me a moment of, silence.

> Sitting opposite Old Mr Wu, the "written complaint" he had paid

> GIRL A: How do you know that your dad has a lover?

> GIRL B: I bumped into them, yuck, they were all over each other.

> GIRL A: Did you tell your mum?

> GIRL B: What would be the point? She said it herself a long time ago,

> GIRL A: Not necessarily, not my dad.

> GIRL A: So what're we going to do when we have men?

> GIRL B: If they can keep lovers, so can we!

> MANAGER: Don't you srub that off, I put that tape over the man's eyes

> 
> CLEANER: I've just mopped it.

> MANAGER: Not hard enough, you should mop the floor until you can see
