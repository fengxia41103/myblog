It is a strange feeling. 

Waiting for the shuttle bus, and bumped into a new group of interns on
their first day &mdash; young, fresh, lively, full of curiosity,
expectation, and maybe hope. The sun shined through a girls hair,
looking like threads w/ waving in the wind, bright, color of life.

Woke up suddenly this morning. Last day of 2019, last day of staying
w/ Dad, going home again. I missed you, very very much. Waking w/ a
mind of you, don't remember now what you were doing in my dream, but
it was you, and only you, could wake me like that. 

Wrote you a letter, maybe I will paste it here later. Sitting on the
taxi coming over, music played a tune that, together with the car
zipping through this city and the morning traffic, with the sun, the
cold air, the strange silence in my heart, fit, like a movie scene. I
almost cried, but it's ok, I felt you, felt myself leaving you, and
that feeling ah, took all myself, away.

I wished I could make my thoughts, all these thoughts of you, into a
movie, someday, that I will play this music at this moment, that I'm
letting it go, finally, letting it go, I can't hold on to you any
longer, if indeed you were a kite, now I am cutting the string... fly,
fly, my love, fly, but remember, I'm here, and when you are tired,
when you are hurt, come back, I'm here, I'll make you laugh, will heal
your wound, and you can fly out again. That's all I want to be, that's
all I can do, that's all I can do, for you.

I love you, with all my heart, with all my soul.
