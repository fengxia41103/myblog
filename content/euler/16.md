[code][2].

Didn't even bother with analysis because this problem is easy. The
only concern is whether Python math can handle large number such as
''2**100'' &rarr; it does, but I would consider this to be '''not
scalable'''. How about 2 to the power of 1000,000? I need to rethink
this one.

```python
def main():
    print sum(map(int, str(2 ** 1000)))
```

Going through posts in [discussion thread][3], only one person raised
this question. Others went with computing `2**100` first and convert
it to string. However, it did confirm with my concern that some
language, eg. EMACScript, can only handle `2**53`, and java has to use
`BitInt` package. So the concern is valid but no one offers a clean
solution.
