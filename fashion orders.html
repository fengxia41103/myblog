    <h1 class="myhighlight">Fashion ERP &mdash; orders</h1>
  </div>

  <ol id="toc" class="row"></ol>

  <div>
    <div id="article-content">
      <p><p>In <a href="https://fengxia41103.github.io/myblog/fashion introduction.html">part one</a> I have
shown the design and function behind Product and Inventory management.
In this article I'll talk about orders.</p>
<p>Sales order and purchase order are like two sides of the same coin.
Each sales order(SO) can include a mixed bag of products from
different vendors. Once a SO has been created, application will parse
it into multiple purchase order (PO) and route them to their
vendor. Reversely, company can place a PO with a vendor, and purchased
products can be used to fulfill multiple sales orders later.</p>
<h1>Order life cycle</h1>
<p>To understand the design of orders, one has to first grasp the life
cycle of an order. I'd like to divide its functions into roughly two
areas: <em>about physical good</em> and <em>about money</em>.</p>
<p>The area of physical goods takes care of the acquisition of products
on order. This includes shipping, receiving, reconciliation,
inventory, product return and substitution. Like what we did in
inventory, we maintain a theoretical list which comes from the sales
order itself (think of it as a wish list) and an actual list which
tracks all the above activities. The ratio between the two is
<code>full-fill rate</code>. All products are cleared when full-fill rate hits
100%.  At this point, seller has fulfilled what the buyer is
expecting, either by original products or replacement or any other
forms of settlement in between.</p>
<figure>
    <img class="center img-responsive" src="images/order life cycle.png">
    <figcaption>Order life cycle</figcaption>
</figure>

<p>The second area of interest is about money. Depending on the business
model and industry, some will require a form of payment, either by a
percentage or in full, before any shipment, while others can live with
zero down up front. The hinge that links activities handling physical
goods and the money is the <em>invoice</em>. Invoice is a detailed record
(bill) that both the seller and the buyer will eventually agree in
order to proceed with a financial reconciliation.  Ideally buyer pays
against an invoice, though I have seen other forms of arrangement in
different industries.  Therefore, on the money side there are also a
theoretical represented by invoices and an actual which are actual
payments. The ratio between these two forms <code>payment ratio</code>. To
simplify things here we will regard financial reconciliation is
complete when payment ratio hits 100%.</p>
<h1>Create an order</h1>
<p>Sales order can be taken in one of two ways. The <em>quick way</em> is designed
for internal staff to create an sales order by directly typing in
line items using a simple syntax:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Each line starts with SKU number, followed by comma delimited
  size-qty pairs.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>For example, <code>234, S-1, M-2</code> is to order product <code>SKU# 234</code>, one <code>small</code>
and two <code>medium</code>. Alternatively one can also create a sales order
through traditional shopping cart method.</p>

    </div></div>
    <figcaption>
      One can use a quick way or shopping cart to create a sales order
    </figcaption>
</figure>

<h2>Order summary and details</h2>
<p>A nice feature here is that for an aggregated information such as total
quantity and sum, the application offers a dropdown that user can
easily view a broken-down detail by each vendor.</p>
<figure>
    <img class="center img-responsive" src="images/fashion_9.png">
</figure>

<p>Order details are grouped by vendor also. Each vendor tab has details
of products on order. At the bottom of tab, the application computes
a <em>total qty</em> and <em>total value</em> for that vendor.</p>
<figure>
  <img class="center img-responsive" src="images/fashion_10.png">
  <figcaption>Order detail tabs are a set of shopping basket, one per vendor</figcaption>
</figure>

<h1>Product receiving and fulfillment</h1>
<p>Product receiving is represented by fulfillment in the application.  I
call an item fulfilled when buyer side has <em>received and accepted</em>
that item. In turn, fulfill rate is the count of items that met this
condition over the total products on order. It is important to note
that only <em>accepted</em> one is counted as fulfilled. Received counts are
inaccurate because item can be received but then returned due to
damage.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>fulfill rate = count of fulfilled item / total number of items</p>
</blockquote>
<figure>
  <img class="center img-responsive" src="images/fashion_11.png">
  <figcaption>Create an order fulfillment</figcaption>
</figure>

<p>Fulfilling a product is almost like filling in an inventory count
sheet.  Potentially this can be automated using barcode scanner or
other form of scanning technology But unlike a count sheet that is
specific for a vendor, fulfillment form lists all vendors and products
on order. This accounts for the fact that shipments can come in at
random order. Therefore, showing them on a single page saves the
receiving staff from jumping through multiple screens in order to
record shipments. <code>QTY BALANCE</code> column shows the remaining quantity
that the application is expecting. This is the <em>theoretical</em> value for
a line time, and the addition of all received fulfillment will be the
<em>actual</em>.</p>
<figure>
    <img class="center img-responsive" src="images/fashion_12.png">
    <figcaption>Fulfillment summary</figcaption>
</figure>

<p>Fulfillment summary is a great way to keep track of receiving status.
One interesting distinction here is the <em>fulfill rate of quantity
versus that of value</em>. This accounts for the fact that products have
different values.  Therefore, a 90% fulfill rate of quantity may not
be a good news if in value the fulfill rate is much lower. Monitoring
this gap can be an early warning sign that the supplier is lagging
behind.</p>
<p>Finalizing a fulfillment is to lock in the receiving status. User can
either do this on each fulfillment (eg. in a long running order where
fulfillment come in over a stretched period of time), or close them
all with a single click. Simple.</p>
<h1>Return a product</h1>
<p>Product return is a common scenario.  Rule we applied here is that
<em>quantity available for return is determined by received
fulfillments</em>. This also means that a return is always associated with
an order. This contrasts to the approach where return is checked
against inventory regardless how that product got into the inventory
at the first place.</p>
<figure>
    <img class="center img-responsive" src="images/fashion_16.png">
    <figcaption>Return a product</figcaption>
</figure>

<p>Also, each line item needs a <code>reason</code>. The list is configurable. An
important decision to make is who will absorb the damage, seller or
buyer. For example, if the agreement is that buyer bears damages if it
was caused by third-party shipper, then no credit will be issued,
which in the application shows as unchanged <code>account
payable</code>. Otherwise, if seller is to pay for this, a credit will be
deducted from the current <em>account payable</em> so buyer owes less now due
to the return.</p>
<h1>Make a payment</h1>
<figure>
    <img class="center img-responsive" src="images/fashion_13.png">
    <figcaption>Make a payment</figcaption>
</figure>

<p>The application has not yet integrated with a payment system. As of
now it provides a function to register a payment against an order.
Also, user can finalize a payment by <em>reviewing</em> it. This in effect
locks down the payment so it is not editable anymore.</p>
<figure>
    <img class="center img-responsive" src="images/fashion_14.png">
    <figcaption>Review a payment</figcaption>
</figure>

<h1>Drop shipping</h1>
<blockquote>
<p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Drop_shipping">Drop shipping</a> is a supply chain management method in which the
retailer does not keep goods in stock but instead transfers customer
orders and shipment details to either the manufacturer, another
retailer, or a wholesaler, who then ships the goods directly to the
customer.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>A sales order can include products from different vendors.
When we shop at Amazon, products do not necessarily come
from an Amazon warehouse. Instead, the order is routed
to the actual seller who will fulfill the order
as if he works for Amazon.</p>
<p>The application parses automatically
a sales order into multiple purchase orders, one per vendor.
These orders will then be tracked individually for fulfillment, payment
and so forth.</p>
<figure>
    <img class="center img-responsive" src="images/fashion_15.png">
    <figcaption>Keep purchase orders in sync with sales order in drop shipping</figcaption>
</figure>

<h1>Purchase order</h1>
<p>I have always viewed purchase as the mirror image of sales. It really
depends on whose view you are referring to because in any transaction
there are always two parties, one will sell and the other will buy. So
from buyer's stand point of view, an order is a PO, and the same order
is a SO for the seller. In turn, a SO will reduce inventory while PO
increases inventory.  However, SO and PO bring in some important
factors in practice besides driving the supply chain in opposite
directions.</p>
<p>First, tax. In most cases seller is responsible for paying tax. In
application this becomes a requirement that SO has functions to
compute and track tax.  Because each business model, industry, state
and country can be quite different in this matter, this is an area I
have experienced a lot of customization and code refactoring.</p>
<p>Second, what is the relationship of a SO and a PO in your business?
Drop shipping, for example, can be modeled as a back-to-back 1-N model
where one SO is parsed to create multiple(N) POs.  This provides full
traceability from sales to purchase.  Retail, on the other hand, may
purchase in bulk with PO way before a SO takes place. Therefore,
seller may not be interested in knowing the product just sold came
from which PO. But on top of this, there are retail business to whom
such traceability is required, for example, food retailer.  Therefore,
attempting to answer this question with a single answer will not work!</p>
<p>What is missing is a business context, something that provides
additional information for the application to make such decision.  In
my client's case, she sells supplier's stock under her name with a
markup.  Goods are then shipped to her distribution warehouse before
re-shipped to end client.  Therefore, when the application runs in
this business context it will enforce a back-to-back SO-PO reference.
She also runs a wholesale business in which purchase and sales have no
such strong bound. Thus the application will leave the SO-PO reference
optional.</p>
<figure>
    <img class="center img-responsive" src="images/fashion_17.png">
    <figcaption>Purchase order summary</figcaption>
</figure>

<p>An interesting thing of fashion industry is that product often has
long lead time. For most vendors a calendar year is divided into two
seasons &mdash; Spring/Summer season and Fall/Winter season. Buyer
will place PO in October or even earlier for the Spring/Summer season
of next year.  So it is not uncommon to see a 6-month lead time, which
introduces large amount of uncertainties to the buyer's operation. To
accommodate this, it is wise to keep informed by vendor on which line
item will be available when. In application we have add a dropdown
list, <em>"Available In"</em>, so this information is captured:</p>
<ul>
<li><span class="myhighlight">unknown</span>: default state, vendor has not released information of its availability</li>
<li><span class="myhighlight">never</span>: this product has been dropped out or sold out</li>
<li><span class="myhighlight">local</span>: can be fulfilled right now by vendor's local outlet</li>
<li><span class="myhighlight">Jan - Dec</span>: calendar month. Its year is implied.</li>
</ul>

<p>In this article, I have covered sales order and purchase order.  They
are the core of the company's operation.  In <a href="https://fengxia41103.github.io/myblog/fashion reports.html">part
three</a>, we will get to the
exciting part of the application where all these data points will be
utilized to drive a better operation.</p></p>
