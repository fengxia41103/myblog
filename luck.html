    <h1 class="myhighlight">Luck</h1>
  </div>

  <ol id="toc" class="row"></ol>

      <p><figure class="col l4 m6 s12">
  <img src="images/luck.jpg"/>
</figure>

<p>I was listening to this <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2g_JFGnJMW4&amp;t=1519s">talk</a> on Youtube about luck, and that got
me thinking.</p>
<p>It's a cliche when people talk about luck, and someone gets lucky, or
unlucky. It feels it is something we have no control over, and it is
just randomly happened, for good and for bad. It is an easy
<strong>execuse</strong> to make an unhappy reality tolerable, and a fortune
justifiable. But in the end, no one can explain what brought that luck
&mdash; granted, there have always been many theories on its coming,
but the fundamental attribute of luck is that it is not predictable!</p>
<p>That's right. I suddenly realized what a luck is &mdash; <span
class="myhighlight">Luck only exists in a rear view
mirror</span>. There is no such thing as <strong>forward looking</strong> luck, or
<strong>future</strong> luck, or <strong>you will get lucky</strong>, because the truth is, you
don't know until it has happened and you already experienced the
result, whatever it may be, pleasant or horrible.</p>
<p>So why can't luck be something we can control, produce, maybe with a
lot of effort, but at least there is a hope? No. What the word <code>luck</code>
has become is actually a baggage of variables that can ONLY
exist in the past, and they  <span
class="myhighlight">may</span> have contributed to the final
result. But there are two problems we simply do not have a method yet, nor
a capacity, to make this reverse engineering effort possible:</p>
<ol>
<li>How do we know how many variables are there that <strong>contributed</strong> to
this result? Literally there are infinite number of them, and each
plays a role in the final showdown. If you think of it, the mere
existence of you and me is an accumulated miracle over that many
seconds of pure coincidence since birth to this very moment that I'm
typing and you are reading.</li>
<li>It is easy to come up with a correlation between a <em>significant</em>
   variable (we think) to the result. But too often one confuses
   correlation with <strong>causal</strong> relationship, and mistakenly took the
   former as the accepted answer. No! Correlation is by definition
   looking in the rear view mirror! It <span class="myhighlight"> can
   not, will not, should not, and absolutely must not</span>, be used
   to produce a deterministic next. There is no such a logic. 
   Therefore, luck can only be <strong>explained</strong> and
   <strong>theorized</strong>, but not (yet) known beforehand.</li>
</ol>
<p>But I got curious. So often we say <em>good luck</em> with a sincere heart;
we believe in religion and pray for miracles; we, everyone of us, get
<em>lucky</em> sometimes. It's a wonderful feeling. Are we powerless in
mastering our own destiny in this sense? Can we influence its
trajectory through something like hard work, training, discipline,
faith, diet, high spirit, good looking, fortune? After all, there are
just so many things we don't like about our current existence &mdash;
the result of a series of <em>bad lucks</em>, and we all wish to change our
luck, to graze the grass on the other hill because they look greener.
We constantly fight this desire for a better luck through painfully
self-reminder that we should be happy with what we already have, and
we label all those thoughts of wanting a change as <strong>desire</strong>,
<strong>greed</strong>, <strong>immuture</strong>, <strong>做</strong>, which all convey a negative feeling
that put us to shame. But if the urge of having a better luck
isn't part of us, why doesn't it just go away? why did it
come up even? This is strange, isn't it?</p>
<p>So if luck is a summary of all the past, I think the computer model is
actually pretty simple. We have a function, <code>result = f(var1, var2,
var3......)</code>, and if only we could count in all the variables, and
have enough samples to test this function. So far we can't have all
the variables yet, because it feels <strong>everything</strong> is related &mdash;
didn't turn right at a cross 10 years ago, well, it eventually leads
to me being still alive, today!  How far fetched it seems! but then,
how true it is!</p>
<p>Life itself is an accumulated decisions, and the funny thing is that
we think some carry more weight than others, but the reality is that
they are all the same! No one has a crystal ball, and no one can turn
back the clock, so decision is a one way street. Therefore, what you
choose today makes no difference whatsoever because there is no
reference! You make a decision, then you move on. Whatever comes out
of life, is the <code>result=f(decision 1, decision 2, .... decison
N)</code>. Since we don't have a book writing down for each decision we made
and linking them to what came out it after, we already lost track of
this record, which in turn makes analysis <strong>impossible</strong>. So when
people say <strong>luck</strong>, it is really nothing but a cherry-picked set of
variables one decides to use to support his/her statement, nothing
more than that!</p>
<p>Therefore, luck, is really in the domain of subjective emotion than
objective reality. The irony, however, lies when someone believes his
success is not due to luck, but some deterministic methodology that
can be replicated and re-iterated. That's pure BS. Just say you are
lucky and move on &mdash; saying "oh I was just lucky" is a polite way
to acknowledge the ignorance, which is the only truth. Seriously, can
you write me this list of variables that are <strong>sufficient</strong> to
generate the same result!? If you can not, you are just, lucky.  Just
don't fool yourself (and many audience, unfortunately) that you have a
recipe. You can have a <em>theory</em>, however, and it's up to others to try
that if they will. But selling your design of success is a lie.</p>
<p>There you have it. Luck, only exists in the past.  It's a
representation of subjectively picked variables to establish a
correlation between the past and a result. So in this sense, you can
<strong>always feel lucky, and be lucky</strong>, if you want to.</p></p>
