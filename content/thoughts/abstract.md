Driving to see Noah's weekend swim meet past Saturday morning. I guess
it was the theme of the day, that many drivers rushed overtaking me,
and either found themselves waiting for at the traffic light ahead
&mdash; it's either a poor timing that right after they passed me, the
light tuned red, or I was slowing down cause the light is red ahead,
but they still felt the urge to overtake, probably more of a statement
or a vent of frustration. In any case, I found it rather humorous
seeing them like a sitting duck when my car slowly approach while they
got nowhere to go.

This isn't new. But this time I got me thinking, that this,
phenomenon, can be categorized into one of the three buckets &mdash;
眼睛不好, 脑子不好, or 运气不好. Hahaha. But then, while I was feeling
proud of such philosophical summary, I wondered how true they are? I
mean, are these three cover all the scenarios? Thinking of the [the
pyramid principle][1], how would I know that these three categories
are sufficient? For the 眼睛不好, apparently this can be proven false
(证伪), but this can't be said for the other two. Arguably you could
say sort-of for the 脑子不好, which I am thinking of psychoanalysis
type of diagnosis. But still, the word 脑子 is ambiguous. As for the
_luck_, there isn't a way of proving at all except more of a fun urban
legend, or a popular form of excuse, for better and for worse, indeed!

Therefore, out of this smart line, 2 of the 3 are not verifiable,
which then makes the credibility of this line dramatically less than
what I had initially felt &mdash; quite a bogus,
looks-cool-but-no-substance type of remarks (and the world is not
short of these, in words and in prints). Why!? Why the line sounds
both _smart_ to my ears, but at the meantime is a BS? I wonder. The
smartness can certainly impress, if not fool, somebody, right? If I
hadn't taken the time to ask whether they are comprehensive, I could
no have come to the realization that two of them are just vain
saying. However, as I have mentioned, there are plenty of such lines
around, and how many did we really a **good thought** whether they can
survive a scrutiny? And not, then hadn't I accepted some of them _at
its face value_ and used them as if they are golden lines?
Interesting.

So, why I think the latter two can not be verified, 脑子不好, 运气不好?
Because the nouns **lack a definition**, you just can't define the
word 脑子, 运气, I guess I should say, you can't measure such a thing,
thus making them **objectively un-provable**. They are,
abstraction. "Abstraction", google said, is "something which exists
only as an idea". In order to make a golden line ring, it must be an
abstraction, a line of an idea summarized out of a general pattern of
events. Can one prove an abstraction, or an idea? I suppose you can!
A theory is an idea, right? then it's provable. But then why some
ideas can be proven (eg. physics), and some can't (eg. religious)? I
don't know. When I started writing this, I thought my conclusion was
that an abstraction is inherently unprovable, but now I'm not so sure.
However, in any case, an abstraction, is inherently a **subjective
opinion** &mdash; why I pick this characteristic of these events but
not that!? As cliche as it can be, 1000 ppl has 1000 version of
Hamlet, thus out of the same group of events, I'm certain there can be
1000 versions of such _golden lines_, and mine is not smarter than
yours at all, just that many people either don't come up their own
Hamlet (thus taking others as the Master's saying), or not making
theirs heard (often until such a conversation is engaged, in which all
of a sudden one finds everyone has a version! The difference is often
being that some have been brewing for a while, while others were only
improvised and quickly forgotten as soon as the dinner talk ends).

So back to the golden line. All these golden lines must be abstraction
because that's what makes it relevant to most audience &larr;
individual lives their own events, which are discrete by nature, your
event is independent of mine, but these golden lines take the pattern
out of our two events, and make them echo w/ both of us, thus we nod
and say 好有道理! While saying so, we often felt we have found the
core of these events &mdash; ah, so this is how they work!. But now
with this article, if you have followed so far, you should now realize
that these lines are, someone's summary/opinion, take or leave, they
are no different than your mom says 该穿秋裤了! Like anything
regarding opinion, remind yourself of independent thinking, meaning,
take the one given by others w/ a grain of salt, chew on it, it's more
fun to find loophole in these lines, aka. being critical, than taking
it wholesale. I guess these lines are just like code, or fiction, or a
shoe &mdash; quality varies substantially, some like 华为, communism,
and some like [John Locke][2], [Martin Luther][3] and his reformation,
and any honest person you know in life.
