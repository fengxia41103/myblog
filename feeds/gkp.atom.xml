two&lt;/a&gt;, I have introduced functions
to assist students get to know about the schools from multiple
aspects. In this article, we will touch upon another important factor
when going to college &amp;mdash; major.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In China, majors are split into three layers: category, subcategory,
and majors. Similar to the &lt;em&gt;state-city-school&lt;/em&gt; configuration,
functions at category and subcategory level focus on statistic
analysis so to offer an overview, where major level contains details
that are relevant to that particular major which students would find
useful.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;figure class="s12 center"&gt;
    &lt;img src="images/gkp_major_setup.png"/&gt;
    &lt;figcaption&gt;Majors are split into 3 layers&lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;According to &lt;a href="https://fengxia41103.github.io/myblog/downloads/20121012084054830.pdf"&gt;document&lt;/a&gt;
published by the &lt;a href="http://www.moe.gov.cn/publicfiles/business/htmlfiles/moe/s3882/201210/xxgk_143152.html"&gt;Department of Education&lt;/a&gt; in 2012, there are 12
categories, 92 subcategories and 506 majors.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;Category and subcategory&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At this level, focus was to provide statistics which is similar to
what is done for schools at &lt;em&gt;State level&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;figure class="s12 center"&gt;
    &lt;img src="images/gkp_18.png"/&gt;
    &lt;figcaption&gt;Major category and subcategory&lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Students can quickly browse through category and subcategory to locate
area of interest she wants to drill further down.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;Major&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At this level, we think the most relevant information students want to
know is the job …&lt;/p&gt;</summary><content type="html">&lt;p&gt;In &lt;a href="https://fengxia41103.github.io/myblog/gkp introduction.html"&gt;part one&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://fengxia41103.github.io/myblog/gkp schools.html"&gt;part

&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;According to &lt;a href="https://fengxia41103.github.io/myblog/downloads/20121012084054830.pdf"&gt;document&lt;/a&gt;
published by the &lt;a href="http://www.moe.gov.cn/publicfiles/business/htmlfiles/moe/s3882/201210/xxgk_143152.html"&gt;Department of Education&lt;/a&gt; in 2012, there are 12

    &lt;figcaption&gt;Major category and subcategory&lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Students can quickly browse through category and subcategory to locate
area of interest she wants to drill further down.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;Major&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At this level, we think the most relevant information students want to
know is the job market datat.  So we built an integration point with
popular job posting sites. Dynamically the application will query
these sites and compile the most recent 50 job posts that matches this
major.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;figure class="s12 center"&gt;
    &lt;img src="images/gkp_19.png"/&gt;
    &lt;figcaption&gt;Job title cloud&lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Based on these data stream, a &lt;em&gt;job title keyword cloud&lt;/em&gt; is compiled
taht shows the job titles used by the industry, and they are further
grouped into cities so they provide another geo reference for
students.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;figure class="s12 center"&gt;
    &lt;img  src="images/gkp_20.png"/&gt;
    &lt;figcaption&gt;Schools grouped by job locations&lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Below listed jobs, application will conveniently show schools that are
located in those cities since local graduate usually have an advantage
competing for jobs in local market. Another feature is that a toggle
switch will turn user's preference on and off so researcher can easily
search either by major and jobs alone, or by combination of the market
data and her own criteria.&lt;/p&gt;</content><category term="gkp"></category><category term="gkp"></category></entry><entry><title>GKP — school details</title><link href="https://fengxia41103.github.io/myblog/gkp%20schools.html" rel="alternate"></link><published>2015-09-07T14:00:00-04:00</published><updated>2015-09-07T14:00:00-04:00</updated><author><name>Feng Xia</name></author><id>tag:fengxia41103.github.io,2015-09-07:/myblog/gkp schools.html</id><summary type="html">&lt;p&gt;In &lt;a href="https://fengxia41103.github.io/myblog/gkp introduction.html"&gt;part one&lt;/a&gt;, we have
introduced functions that will help school
research at nation level, state and city level. In this article
I'll talk about features built to help research at &lt;em&gt;school level&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;Bookmark&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While research schools, it is useful to bookmark a page for later
use. That's where the &lt;em&gt;bookmark&lt;/em&gt; feature comes in. User can save
unlimited bookmarks and manage them by &lt;em&gt;x-out&lt;/em&gt;(remove) it from saved
list. Convenient.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;figure class="row"&gt;
    &lt;div class="col s6"&gt;
    &lt;img class="img-responsive center" src="images/gkp_9.png" /&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="col s6"&gt;
    &lt;img class="img-responsive center" src="images/gkp_10.png" /&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
    &lt;figcaption&gt;Bookmark a school&lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;h1&gt;School summary&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;School summary are mostly text extracted from multiple sources.  The
first page contains an introduction, or a quick view, of the school.
It contains many meta data that can be extracted to form more data
dimensions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;figure class="s12 center"&gt;
    &lt;img src="images/gkp_11.png"/&gt;
    &lt;figcaption&gt;School summary&lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;School detail page expands on top of the introduction. One small feature
concerning development is that TOC is auto generated.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;figure class="s12 center"&gt;
    &lt;img  src="images/gkp_12.png"/&gt;
    &lt;figcaption&gt;School wiki&lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;h1&gt;Historical admission scores&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This page lists historical cutoff scores that the school has applied
in past admissions. GKP has collected over 2,000,000 data records
between 2010 and 2014 and covering 3,000 schools.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;figure class="s12 center"&gt;

&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;School detail page expands on top of the introduction. One small feature

    &lt;figcaption&gt;School historical cutoff scores&lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Students can then use these scores as reference compared to her
estimated exam score in order to get a sense of how likely she will be
admitted.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;Social life&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One important factor to consider, also a unique feature of this
application, is the campus social life. Here we created an advanced
backend engine to tap into popular social media facilities and pull in
live chat stream at &lt;strong&gt;50,000 new posts per minute&lt;/strong&gt;. This gives
students a rich information on how the campus life is like.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;figure class="s12 center"&gt;
    &lt;img  src="images/gkp_14.png"/&gt;
    &lt;figcaption&gt;School social media data stream&lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Data stream is being updated every 60 seconds. So for a user it is
convenient to leave the window open and watch new posts appear on the
screen instead of refreshing page manually.  Also, there is a voting
mechanism behind the scene so that the more users a page is being
viewed (thus indicating more popularity), the higher priority the page
has in term of receiving the next update.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;figure class="row"&gt;
  &lt;div class="col s6"&gt;
    &lt;img class="img-responsive center" src="images/gkp_15.png"/&gt;
  &lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="col s6"&gt;
    &lt;img class="img-responsive center" src="images/gkp_16.png"/&gt;
  &lt;/div&gt;
  &lt;figcaption&gt;Social media keyword cloud and news ticker&lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Based on these streamed social media data, the application provides a
&lt;em&gt;Keyword Cloud&lt;/em&gt;(shown on the left) that reflects hot topics in the
most recent 100 threads.  Further, the &lt;em&gt;Live Campus&lt;/em&gt;(shown on the
right) section shows thread summaries in a scrolling news ticker
fashion which makes monitoring these threads simple and fun.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;Wechat channels&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Wechat is a &lt;em&gt;whatsapp&lt;/em&gt; equivalent in China. It has a dominating role
especially among young people. Here user will find a list of Wechat
channels that are affiliated with the candidate school, including
school news, clubs, communities and activities. Connecting to them is
as simple as scanning the barcode with her phone. It is another unique
feature that makes acquiring school information as painless as
possible.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;figure class="s12 center"&gt;
    &lt;img  src="images/gkp_17.png"/&gt;
    &lt;figcaption&gt;School Wechat channels&lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;h1&gt;Major&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In &lt;a href="https://fengxia41103.github.io/myblog/gkp introduction.html"&gt;part one&lt;/a&gt; and this
article, we have introduced research functions that assist user at
different level of interest. Here comes another important
consideration that any student must have &amp;mdash; majors.  What to
study is often driven by interest, but also it is closely affected by
its future job seeking prospective. In &lt;a href="https://fengxia41103.github.io/myblog/gkp majors.html"&gt;part three &amp;mdash;
majors&lt;/a&gt; we will go over these
topics.&lt;/p&gt;</content><category term="gkp"></category><category term="gkp"></category></entry><entry><title>GKP — introduction</title><link href="https://fengxia41103.github.io/myblog/gkp%20introduction.html" rel="alternate"></link><published>2015-09-04T10:00:00-04:00</published><updated>2015-09-04T10:00:00-04:00</updated><author><name>Feng Xia</name></author><id>tag:fengxia41103.github.io,2015-09-04:/myblog/gkp introduction.html</id><summary type="html">&lt;p&gt;GKP project was conceived from a meeting with a friend of mine,
Mr.Zhang, back in Jan, 2015.  Mr.Zhang has been in China's college
education business for 15 year. He has succeeded in building a couple
online training services and is also the head of a private
college. The GKP project is to consolidate multiple data sources into
one place so to facilitate high school graduates and their parents
searching and evaluating college and university.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In this article I'll give a brief introduction of core functions and
thoughts behind each design. It also illustrates how we have
approached each problem with the solution you are currently seeing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;User preference&lt;/h1&gt;

    &lt;figcaption&gt;Set up user preferences&lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;These settings are related directly to how Chinese college categorize
students. Take the &lt;strong&gt;Geo requirement&lt;/strong&gt; setting for example.  Let's say
that MIT takes 3,000 freshmen each year. Instead of accepting
application nation wide, MIT assigns a fixed quota to each state. Some
states get more quota comparing to their share of the student
population, while others get less. A student from a low
quota-to-student ratio state will then have a reduced chance of
getting into MIT even though she meets the school's qualification.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To enforce this arrangement, it is a hard requirement that student can
only attend national entrance exam in the state that her &lt;strong&gt;birth place
is registered (户口)&lt;/strong&gt; (This is a simplified version, but is generally
true). Therefore, regardless where she lives now, she is locked in to
the quota assigned to her &lt;em&gt;home&lt;/em&gt; state. This is a sad reality.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;Nation level: a school map&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The drive behind this function is that students often have a geo
preference in mind.  This function is to make it easy when she wants
to browse schools based on its geo location.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Initially I was to build a Google map view with overlayed filter.  Geo
code was looked up first using Google map API. This alone took about a
week to resolve limited by the upper limit Google imposed on each API
account and the initial trial and error time. Drawing the map was
straightforward using &lt;a href="https://developers.google.com/maps/documentation/javascript/tutorial"&gt;Google map API&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://github.com/googlemaps/js-marker-clusterer"&gt;marker cluster&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;figure class="s12 center"&gt;
    &lt;img  src="images/gkp_21.png"/&gt;
    &lt;figcaption&gt;Using Google map to browse schools&lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;However, a couple issues with this approach:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Computing markers within the view bound was time consuming. This is
   especially so when user has few filtering criteria.  This will
   result in displaying all schools on the map. Zooming in will reduce
   the number of markers. So a potential solution is to set the
   initial zoom large enough to view only a section of the country's
   territory.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Some addresses were not resolved or resolved incorrectly. They were
   viewable on Google map itself, but the returned geo code was
   different. It feels like Google uses a better version for his own
   use and serves the rest of us with a lower quality data set. A way
   to resolve this is to check the address with other geo decoding
   services. So I tried Baidu map API. That's when all hell broke
   loose.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;First of all, two systems yielded two different geo codes for the same
school address!  How could this be? Are they having two different GPS
systems? My guess is that their data providers are different. But
whose data is correct?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Further, displayed location on the map are different, sometimes not
even close. Then I tried swapping geo code for the purpose of
experiment &amp;mdash; using Google's geo code to plot on Baidu map. The
result was even stranger. This made me to think that either Google or
Baidu has massaged their data on purpose in order to create this
incompatibility.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Considering the GFW, I abandoned both maps and back to a simple
Chart. Map is drawn using &lt;a href="https://ecomfe.github.io/echarts/index-en.html"&gt;Echarts&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;figure class="s12 center"&gt;
    &lt;img src="images/gkp_1.png"/&gt;
    &lt;figcaption&gt;School map using Echarts&lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Legend on the bottom left corner shows school counts categorized into
different shades of color. The darker an area is, the more schools
there are.  Schools in each state are further grouped by its city
(shown on the right) and can be drilled down.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;State level: statistics&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Next layer below a national view of all schools on a country map is at
state level.  Most people have a general idea of state, such as its
climate, culture, food, and so forth. So here instead of these
information, we focused on aggregated data analysis. In short, schools
within the same state boundary will be grouped along different
dimensions. Statistics are then computed on the fly to provide quick
facts.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;figure class="s12 center"&gt;
    &lt;img src="images/gkp_3.png"/&gt;
    &lt;figcaption&gt;School statistics quickview at State level&lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Each dimension can be drilled down to reveal more stats. Among them,
two important dimensions are important for a student
&amp;mdash; Bachelor's vs. Associate program, and tiers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;figure class="s12 center"&gt;
    &lt;img src="images/gkp_4.png"/&gt;
    &lt;figcaption&gt;School statistics drill down by programs and admission tiers&lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The distinction in the degrees are simple to understand. Some schools
and programs offer certificate program while others are accredited by
the government to issue degrees.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A unique concept here is the &lt;em&gt;admission tier&lt;/em&gt;.  In China, all college
admissions fall into one of the four tiers listed in descending time
order &amp;mdash; &lt;em&gt;pre tier, 1st tier, 2nd tier and 3rd tier&lt;/em&gt;.  Tiers work
in a waterfall mode. School start with top tier in an admission cycle
and moves down the tiers until all spots are filled. Therefore the
lower the tier is, the less likely a top school will come by. On the
other hand, lower tier has a lower score requirement.  Pre tier is for
school with specialized program, eg. military schools. Often, it is
also the time when elite students get picked by school. For all
others, they have to make a decision prior to the exam day which tier
she is going into, and the primary reference is her estimated score.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;figure class="s12 center"&gt;
    &lt;img src="images/gkp_5.png"/&gt;
    &lt;figcaption&gt;School statistics drill down by school types&lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Another dimension is the type of school. Students who want to study
arts can quickly find schools specializing in that.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;City level&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What would student want to know about a city? First of all, some
general data imported from wikipedia. Since wikipedia does not have an
API for keyword search, the challenge was to have the computer
matching city name to a wiki page and parse the page for imported data
bits.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;figure class="row"&gt;
  &lt;div class="col s6"&gt;
    &lt;img class="img-responsive center" src="images/gkp_6.png"/&gt;
  &lt;/div&gt;
  &lt;div class="col s6"&gt;
    &lt;img class="img-responsive center" src="images/gkp_7.png"/&gt;
  &lt;/div&gt;
  &lt;figcaption&gt;City wiki&lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Next, an interesting idea came up during our discussion. &lt;em&gt;How
convenient is it to get to the city from where I live?&lt;/em&gt; So we decided
to build a train schedule that will show exactly which train are
available to take, all stops in between, and the actual time elapse.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;figure class="s12 center"&gt;
    &lt;img src="images/gkp_8.png"/&gt;
    &lt;figcaption&gt;City to city train schedule search engine&lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Considering that no map API or travel search engine can mix up flight
with train to generate a complete door-to-door route, this function
has a great potential to be extended into a service of its own where
flight, train, bus and subway data are matched up.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;School level&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Everything comes down to school level where school specific details
are laid out to assist prospective students evaluate not only the
future academic life but also its social life. Read on our &lt;a href="https://fengxia41103.github.io/myblog/gkp schools.html"&gt;part two
