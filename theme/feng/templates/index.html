            <h2>Building Prototype</h2>

            <p>
                I build prototypes. My mission is to lower the barrier for entrepreneurs to translate their idea into web application.
            </p>

            <p>
                I specialize in building and delivering
                proof-of-concept (POC) using robust system
                architecture and technology. I believe many critical
                details can only surface when tried. An
                idea can look great on paper, but to get
                all its pieces working coherently together as one system
                is not an easy task. A prototype is an attempt to
                achieve such coherent integration. A
                working POC is exciting because it lowers risk, raises
                confidence, removes ambiguity, clarifies design,
                discovers barrier, and reveals a path to success.
            </p>

            <p>
                Here I present some samples of my research works and
                recent projects (2015-16) &mdash; design documents,
                lesson learned, tools used, thoughts and
                discussions. Dig in and look around.  If you'd like to
                convert your idea into a Django-based web application,
                I'm here to help.
