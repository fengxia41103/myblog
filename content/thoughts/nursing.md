Due to Dad's deterioating condition, nursing home becomes a necessary
option that we must consider as a way to handle this situation. The
following are notes most based on recollection and first impression
so that they are likely biased and are certainly opinionated.

Sites visited:

1. 北京金手杖: recommended by my college group and by a highschool
   friend. Either the marketing was well done or the word-of-mouth was
   quite successful.
2. 苏州怡养园: recommended by 大姐、小姐 and our neighbour. It's meant
   to be the best option in Suzhou.
3. 上海泰康申园: recommended by a BJ friend. The facility also has locations in
   BJ and Guangzhou. Well known for its patients such as 前外交部长吴
   仪. It was also mentioned that enrolled patients can move from
   location to location free of charge.
4. 上海凯健国际Cascade Health: invested by Cascade from the
   States. Looks great on paper. Highend service.

# Basic model

All sites run with the same model by having two offerings:
independent living 自理 and dependent care 护理. 

Independent care rents a room with one or two beds. Helper is extra
and completly depending on client's preference. You can either hire
theirs or bring your own. Costs include rent, helper, food, utility.

Dependent care charge per bed. Helper is mandatory and is depending on
the severity of client's condition. Costs include rent, helper, and
food. Overall expanse is roughly 50% more expansive than the one of
independent care.

There are community rooms of various kind and group
activities such as singing, dancing, movie, interest group and such.
Basic services usually include laundry, room cleaning,
hair cut, physical therapy, nutrition consulting. Quality however varies.

# Independent care 自理区

Independent care can be rather lively. People in BJ site are rather
young. So it feels more like a group living that these people are
seeking fun being together. Since helper service is not mandatory it
is more of a rental service with basic house cleaning, community
living, 一日三餐 ready, and accessibility to medical service and
additional help when needed.

Helpers are nearly all 农村妇女 with likely low education level since
the expectation is room service instead of personal/medical
service. They usually charge a basic fee regardless whether you hire
their helpers or not. Utility is charged per room. One can cook, and
some even allow unregistered family members living there so a room can
accommodate more than the patient. 上海泰康 charge per head instead of
room.

# Dependent care 护理区

First of all, none provide dedicated dementia services. They all have
such patients. Only 上海泰康 is actively pursing assisting methods to
battle deterioating situation; all others are merely accommodating
with challenges of basic living and no more.

Since these patients are at mercy of these care takers, I think it
becomes crucial to evaluate their attitude towards the disease, the
effect on the patient and people around him, and the approach they are
to take to help the situation.

## 北京金手杖

Facility is nearly identical to its independent care section except an
added nurse frontdesk on each floor. However the woman doctor
disappaered during my short visit and the desk was unattended. Even
though there is medical cabinet in the back room, I felt the room
was strangely uncluttered so I suspect the room doesn't have much
supply, therefore the service it can provide will also be limited.

I did not see any patient with Dad's symptom. They may be taken for
walk, or the patient they have are 卧床 type instead of Dad's
situation. Either way, helpers are midage country women who unlikely
received much training. There is 1 on 1 available but the person will
not sleep in the same room, therefore this is only a 12-hour deal.
Independent section, on the other hand, has room with double beds or a
small storage room that can be used for helper's bedroom.

Each room has two beds so it is shared. However, not many patients on
the floor I visited so many rooms are open to pick.

The sales we spoke to knew the services well. There were a few
occasions that residents greeted her so she was well recognized and
people seemed like her. The atmosphere was light hearted and
easygoing, which was a comforting sign.

## 苏州怡养园

Facility is similar to its independent care section with an added
nurse frontdesk. Nurse was there chatting with an old guy on
wheelchair. The old man wanted to make a call to his son and so she
helped him that. I couldn't tell whether it was a pretended call or
real. The old guy started talking to the person on the other end of
the phone that 你怎么还不来阿，他们对我不好... and the nurse and a few
people nearby looked at the scene and thought it was funny. There was
no sign that a visitor like me may be disturbed by such a message
however unreal it may be. This made me quite uncomfortable.

We visited at their lunch time. There were about 30 patients, 5 to 6
per table. Same cookie cutter food (see photo) with no personal care
to feed them even though one person apparently had trouble finding his
mouth. All were wearing an apron (their way to keep them tidy). There
was little conversation between staff and the olds. Another thing that
brushed me the wrong side was that I was allowed to take photos of
them sitting at desk eating or waiting for their food despite of the
**No photo is allowed** sign on wall. Neither the sales nor the nurse
showed any sign of warning. I felt bad for these olds sitting there as
if they were on display.

Helpers were mostly country looking midage male and females, reminding
me the staff who used to work in my college cateferia. Nurse at the
front desk is a girl in her 20s.

Each room has the old's photo posted but there were few personal
belongs such as photos. The whole place made me feel that person touch
was there for a show.

Sales were a young guy with busy phone calls throughout our
conversation. He lacked knowledge (or there just wasn't any) of
service details and used common skills to skim through my questions
without giving straight answers. Further, I met the head doctor, a
woman in her mid-40s, who appeared to be knowledgeable of Alzhymer
symptoms. We were discussing about medical evaluation options, during
which she brought up a few times that they are not responsible for
medical conditions and will send the old to hospital if medical
attention is needed. Even though this is mutually understood, but she
made feel a lack of will to be responsible in general. Both these two
people talked with shifting eyes looking at each other as if to sync
the message. This turned me off.

## 上海泰康(申园)

Facility is absolutely top notch. The library room and movie theater
were impressive. There were cleaning staff throughout the building and
everything was nearly spotless. All elevators are equipped with a
bench where the olds can sit down &mdash; a nice touch. Facility
includes a full scale hospital and its 19th and 20th floor are
dedicated dementia (they call it **memory loss**) sections. Section is
guarded with double security doors and required badge access.

We run into the young girl who is charge of this section. First
impression was good. She felt 很细心, not rushing to speak when asked
and knew her stuff very well. She has a notebook with patient's
schedule and observation notes. Each patient's are listed in
30-min intervals with handwriting notes of the person's preference,
habit, things staff should pay attention. When we wanted to sit down
in community room for further discussion, the sales girl asked for 
her permission and she closed door behind us. It was apparent that
protecting the patient's space was well observed.

Also, photo of patient was strictly prohibited. Another plus point.  I
visited at their lunch time. There were two young girl at desk helping
three olders, one was being fed by a young girl. The others had no
trouble eating by themselves. They actually appeared completly
normal. Nurse at frontdesk were also helping at desk which is located
right in front of the nurse counter. The girls know these patients
well and can elaborate their features, habits, and often their recent
changes.  The conversation between them were soft, kind and not
demeaning in any way.

Patient has single room. Occupied rooms are off the limit for visitors
and doors were all shut. This was another difference from the other
sites, at which sales were inviting me to look into others' as a
showroom.

A highlight of this visit was when I was impressing how little one can
do to help them. The woman manager countered that they created simple
games for them, similar to ones for babies, and "他们可以作这些简单的
游戏". There is also nutritionist who is responsible to each patient's
meals.

Overall, in this place I felt **hopeful**, and what a priceless feeling anyone can
wish for right now?

## 上海凯健Cascade Health

This was a complete disappointment. The sales contact were not there
and the frontdesk boy she directed me knew next to nothing about the
service and price. Walking around the facility was rather depressing
also.

First, the location bragged river view (by 黄浦江). Yet the section of
that water can at most be called a creek. Forget about the view, I
suspect there is even much water in that canal.

Many sections of the facility had no lights. Since it was a cloudy day
the whole place felt poor lit and damp. I peeked into a few rooms in
both sections. There were couples living together with likely their
own furniture since they look awefully familiar to those I found in 江
南 homes &mdash; all dark colored and looked heavy. All room doors
were semi-opened which is another living custom among
southerners. 

There were physical therapy for patients who are paralyzed. I couldn't
however tell how well it was received or performed. Since little
information the boy was able to provide, the tour was short, dry and
little helpful. Oh well, so much for an international name.

# Recommendation

Based on all these and the indirect signals I picked up, I highly
recommend 上海泰康 for Dad's well being both in the short term and in
the long run.

To get in it requires 200k deposit and 3-month fee, an all-inclusive
24k per month &rarr; 280k at first payment. Each following month
payment can be handled by dividing it into three tranches:

1. Dad's pension: 7000
2. Suzhou fund: 10000
3. Feng: 7000

First of all, this is sustainable. Suzhou fund has plenty to sustain
in that rate and will leave good amount reserve for rainy days. 
My portion is affordable with my current job.

Second, this makes it possible that we all keep our current job and
family setup without much change. Of course being nearby is still
preferred. But this level of service makes one feel comfortable to
leave for job or travel if needed.

Third, Mom may join. If the facility is inviting for her, she
can decide to join nursing home soon, thus making an arrangement now instead of
later. To afford this we will make it clear that one of the two houses
must be used for the support. This can also help her to realize the
tradeoff and, if so, use the equity for true need instead of paper
profit. Not to mention liquidation now also lessen the hassles of their
will concerns.
