But this screenshot from [kiki][1] brightens my day ~~

I miss 米粒儿和米答应. Sometimes I feel really sorry that I feel like
I have walked out of their life. Maybe she feels that way, too. But
then I know I didn't. I didn't mean to, and I did what I said I would,
I didn't lie or being insincere about the future and how we could
be. I did what I meant to do, and I needed to do it not only because I
cared, but I meant to get myself ready so I could do what I committed
to do.

But sometimes I feel it was taken in the wrong way, or maybe it was
just timing and pressure and temptation and everything else. There
were signs that she has wavered, though I had been aware but didn't
want to admit. Then, for 米粒儿 & 米答应, they probably didn't
understand any of these. Poor little things.

But there is one thing I can always look at myself into the eyes, or
God's when I'm in the death bed, that I was honest to myself, to her,
to 米粒儿 & 米答应. I had never thought of anything that could mean to
be harm them in any way. How could I? Seeing her cry was the hardest
thing, and I don't want that to happen anymore, ever. 

I don't know. Maybe I did leave. But I left everything good about me,
there. I have nothing left I'm feeling proud of. I don't know what I
will be, dying alone perhaps. But that doesn't scare me a bit. Yes,
death is a relief, a closure. I would wish to see them again, to see
the smiles, the laughs, the meows and goofy moves, the song you sang,
and the talents that I have so admired and wished for your success and
happiness.

Like this lovely silly cat, it always brightens my day, like you have
done, to my life.
