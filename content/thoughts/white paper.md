The news clip of Shanghai's protest was a surprise when I first saw it
yesterday morning. But I couldn't help feeling the emotion charged in
the air, and the excitement after that has been now injected in my
body. For a full day and night I couldn't really dismiss the images
and thoughts, and earned to view news over and over wishing there were
more development becoming available. Sometimes I even felt an urge to
be onsite just take some pictures. I don't think I am keen on any
political agenda if there were any. But the manifest of human emotion
after such a long depression, whether labeled under the covid or not,
finally erupted and, **heard**, is contagious and **touching**. Maybe
it does speak to still a thing in my body, a thread of youth maybe,
that revolts for unfairness, asks for kindness, and leans to support
the weak, the vulnerable, the suffered &mdash; a voiceless face, a facelss
name, a nameless victim.

One couldn't have chosen a better totem than a white paper. It can be
interpreted in so many ways, and is so well echoed w/ the Chinese
culture & history. Easily it's a symbol to protest the censorship that
no criticism is being shutdown w/o mercy and exception. It's also a
history when the Empress Wu put up a tablet for her tomb w/ no words
on it &mdash; I vividly remember the story when data told me of this,
I was just about Noah's age now, that she thought her achievement were
too great for any words to capture, or, wasn't she fear of
controversial postmortem? So this piece of paper also signifies the anger
and emotion the beholders had, which, in many ways are too
overwhelming to be in words.

Or, didn't this party started by preaching that the best picture could
be drawn on a blank page? So they were using this line to justify
their ideology of smashing all the olds to make way for the "new",
which they themselves staged to represent. But of course in the end
the olds were smashed alright, but the _new_ turned out to be indeed
something new &mdash; some new ways of repeating old crime and new
methods to create old misery. The powerful are still beyond law and
moral, and their biggest interests are to shut off eyes and ears, and
numbing heart and soul. Surely blank paper is a clean start, but
social life has no reset button. I don't know any possibility to
create such a blankness without extincting the life off this piece of
land, or should I say, yes there is such blank paper, so will be the
after effect of its creation &mdash; a lifeless void.

Holding up this paper! Yes let's hold this aloft! In a kid's hand it's
the raw ingredient of an airplane. So it's also the seed for a spirit
to ever gain a pair of wings so it can fly, high and free.
