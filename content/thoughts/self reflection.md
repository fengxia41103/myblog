Watching the [Civilisaiton][1] Youtube, what a fantastic topic and
description of western civilisation! This is quite interesting
especially with the backdrop of Jared
Diamond's [Guns, Germs, and Steel][3], which I found it godly
convincing as I was first introduced to think about the history of
human civilisation through his [documentary][4].
However, the two views of what gave birth and energy to the rise and
fall of a civilisation are quite, different, though both are
intriguing and far beyond my scope of knowledge and even
imagination. Nonetheless, there is one thing suddenly came to me, and
I think it's a topic worth writing about.

What is it?

In all the videos, literature, thinking, and theory of the
indisputable advance of the western civilisation, there are plenty
episodes and text devoted to the dark side of the western history
&mdash; slavery, the conquest of South America, war with the native
Indians... there were pure cruelty, absolutely inhumane deeds, against
animal, against nature, against another human being. It makes your
heart shaken; if there were God, he must have been on vacation then.

So even though the conclusion and the way to state those years are
one-sided (as I have not seen a black host in the program), the sheer
act to illustrate  what happened, to ask why that was so, to question what
impact it made to the advance of society and the deterrence of
progress, to feel shamed about the horror winners imposed upon the
losers, to caution that history isn't just a mirror of ourselves, it
is a prophecy, is encouraging.

On the contrast, I asked myself, **what literature or anything I
have been taught in school or heard in today's forum touches upon the
same theme of China's own history**!? I could think of none. 

Yes, there are programs on history, and I have quite enjoyed some of
them. But even in those which I really liked, I hardly sensed an eye
of scrutiny that not only picked up all the romance and wonder, but
also the human cost lay behind those pride. Yes, I know there is
censorship that made authors and hosts no choice but to turn their
head to one side, only. But that doesn't explain it. Really, among
nearly all talks and shows, I haven't heard a single voice who digs
into the vast, pride history of boasted 5,000 years of this enormous
oriental civilisation, and ask, "How did other races living in China
these days lose the race to the dominantæ±‰?"

You know, these days one thing that constantly makes me mad is the
popular opinion that all population except those of the middle earth
were backwards, and were only saved by China's advanced philosophy,
culture, and technology. They paid contribute out of a pure admiration
and respect; no bully, no trickery, no fuss.

How could that be!!!? No way. If we truly believe the length of our
history, then think about it, 5000 years! That's an unimaginable
length of time that no one has ever experienced (cause we all die <
100, most of us). Stop cheery picking a few moments in the history and
say "Look! See how wonderful we have treated them!" Excuse me? The
country could only have gained this mass of land through
force. Period. Even for the US, it bought land from France and Mexico
because, well, they showed enough force to take them whether the
seller was willing to sell or not. So if you still believe in a tale
of angel stroke a deal for the two parties in which one party traded
an abstract called **culture** (or arts, poems, philosophy, anything
that is paperware) while the other trades land, then you live in the
world of the Matrix. Neil, wake up.

So this lack of self-reflection, the constant finger pointing to
invaders who caused ALL the misery for any setbacks, is perfectly
consistent with what I witnessed in today's China &mdash;
irresponsible from top government all the way to the street vendor.
<span class="myhighlight">Of course, how could one do anything bad, if
his ancestor has been kind to everyone come to his path for 5000
years!?</span> We always showered them with kindness and wisdom, but
look at what they brought in return?

This, is just utterly absurd!

To learn, we know review is a must; to do better next time, no
professor can beat your own mistakes and errors. Apply to a person,
apply to a country, apply to a society, apply to a civilisation.
So next time when someone brags about the rise the new China, let's
not use GDP or the 13 billion people for index. **How about the number of
documentaries and books, like [this one][2], for a change (of mindset)?**
