When was the last time I watched clouds floating by? when was the last
time you watched clouds floating by?

I can't recall it anymore. It felt like a strange memory. Do you know
when you are staring at clouds, you feel it is moving towards you,
becoming larger and larger, and some part of it is always moving,
changing, like 棉絮, how fascinating!

Last night's street food definitely had a toll on both of us. Swimming
a bit helped, but I could still feel the cranking at stomach, and Noah
is taking a nap next by the pool. These traveling young couple decided
to have lunch at the hotel's restaurant. I could smell the perfume
the girl is wearing. Beautiful weather, a bit hot, but beautiful. I
don't think we can ask more from nature for a better life. 

Noah had a sharp observation the other day, that there is no cars
honking! Yes indeed. The whole city, regardless the zillion bikes,
scooters, motorcycles, kids on every kind on every kind of these,
cars, street dogs, chickens... it feels, life, but not noisy. The air
smells burning fire from street food stalls and grocery markets. This
place is poor, but it has a pleasant smell, a relaxing feel. The
girl's fragrance is becoming another string of this city smell.

How far can smell travel? how long can it last? I know smell can burn
into memory, deep, that I recall walking in Beijing park w/ mom a few
years back when she was showing me those flowers. All of sudden I
recall the smell. You couldn't tell where you had that before, but you
know it. 

Clouds are floating by, together, with this fragrance in the air, and
the city bustles in the background. Sun rays over the swimming pool, a
butterfly going anywhere she feels please. When will this happen
again? and when will I recall? 

Went to a coffee shop on the way to scooter rental place this
morning. Both Noah and I didn't feel well. So we stopped this place
for a recharge. It's gift shop is really nice. Got a string bag, just
what I wanted for trip like this! and a wallet made out of rubber
tire, which I thought it was thick leather. How wonderful! I guess it
is from one of the recycle programs that locals make these artifacs,
and sell to support a program. It's good cause I hope. It doesn't
really matter that much. I liked the place, liked the morning walk w/
Noah, liked the small gift shop and the two post cards I picked. 

They are over priced by local standard I'm sure. But I want to leave
something to this country, to this beautiful place, because, it had
given me so much in my first vist, w/ her, and has given me beautiful
clouds and a pleasant smell. She didn't wear perfume. I don't need
that to remind me of everything.

I remember, still.
