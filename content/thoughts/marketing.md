Man wasn't that annoying! Listened to this [book][1] on the way to
outlet yesterday, and the language it used annoyed the shxxt out of
me. Let me explain why.

# Total attention

The content is actually fine. There is a total sum of `attention`
consumers can provide:

> `total consumer attention` = `num_of_consumer` x `16 hr/day` x `365
> days/yr` x `adjustment %`

So in essence this term is equivalent to a percentage of `total time`
a consumer spends on a particular message, which corresponds to what I
have always been saying that the only dimension immune to any
manipulation and variables (by far) is <span
class="myhighlight">time</span> &mdash; it is a continuously flow
forward. No one can stop it; no one can shorten it or expand it; and
nothing can ignore it. 

So far, so good. Then the talk starts a deep dive into what he thinks
the successful stories of marketing by quoting history of certain
marketing and strategies, and that's when it started to annoy me,
badly.

# Grand labeling

First, the term `祖师爷`. What does it mean? This is such a common
term used by the Chinese as if everybody has agreed upon its
definition. Here is [one][2]:

[2]: https://baike.baidu.com/item/%E7%A5%96%E5%B8%88%E7%88%B7

> 1. 某种技艺的发明创造者。
> 2. 对一行业的形成，有过重大贡献的人。
> 3. 某位历史名人，曾做过某种行业。
> 4. 某为神灵与某一行业有关。

But you see, when you want to make a statement that _a marketing
strategy is not new_, you can use a supportive evidence by tracing back in
time to find an older instance of it. But then labeling that instance
to `祖师爷` (and the talk is filled with this term, 祖师爷this, 祖师爷
that..), no! Where is the proof that he invented the strategy? or to
prove that his practice of the trade **contributed significantly** to
the development of this line of business? Since words like
`significantly` must be <span class="myhighlight">relative</span>, the
argument has to be provide a reference, sth like 

> Before his time, the work was done in such a such way, and it was
> less effective... comparing to his new method....

Something like that. Otherwise, that's just a **single instance** you
mentioned and then quickly labeled with a _good looking_ word ` 祖师爷
` as if this is self-justified! But you see, that's exactly the
problem of today's Chinese expression &mdash; because it lacks the
depth of research, or lacks the willingness to convey knowledge, it
falls back to use these terms **liberally** as a window dresser so to
make it impressive, but actually vague at best, and completly false
at worst!

This is cheating. This can easily becomes a lie. A grand label doesn't
make your message any more true than it is. Period. But sadly, it can
fool some of the people some of the time.

# Propaganda

Now comes the worst part. First, let me make this clear, whoever
thinks of marketing as being dressed up every moment (night and day)
and party party, you shouldn't do this business, at all.

Marketing/advertising is neither flashy nor noble. It itself is not
`高大上`, because it's a line of business that, like everyone else,
takes a lot of research, hard work, and discipline to be successful. I
think the underline image of a marketer being always the one standing
the spot light making some grand announcement to his audience (yes,
and the talk inevitably used Hitler as an example of such image) is
just wrong by itself! 

No, I'm not against using Hitler in this context
&mdash; he certainly had his way to launch propaganda and influence
his audience. But his being the tag of this horrifying episode of
human history was not rooted in his charm or his voice or his
marketing strategy. No. The event has a deeply rooted historical context
traced way back beyond the defeat of the WWI. So to me, German or
Europe was to have a war with or without Hitler. Someone
was bound to play that role. If the talker ever reads some history of
WWII and of Hitler, the sentiment of [antisemitism][3] was not a
creation of Nazi as many (particular my fellow Chinese) have falsely
thought.

So one thing the talk got it right, is that propaganda is a weapon of
massive destruction, and that's exactly why <span class="myhighlight">
I'm totally totally against any social propaganda led by the all
mighty government regardless how wonderful the message may be and how
wonderful the outcome in the future may be</span>. Whatever it is
advertising might lead everyone to paradise; but the means to achieve
it, the way the message is communicated, can be seamlessly used to
lead everyone to hell, because fundamentally such practice silents
independent thinking and voice, and that is the worst one can do to
himself, both in the scale of a society and in the scale of an
individual.

# Creating needs

</figure>

IMHO, the talk completly misled audience to think that marketing and
advertising is to manipulate consumer's mind so to make them believe
they have a need. The example of [orange juice][4] is just
terrible. It was true; but it is also true that marketer was nothing
but the executor of a business desire driven by an industry, not the
inventor. <span class="myhighlight">Everyone has this idea &mdash; to
sell you something, I need to create a belief in you to feel good
about having it. So just like any idea on this earth, ideas are cheap,
the execution is the hard part</span>.

And when you talk about **belief**, well, there are only two ways to
achieve that &mdash; propaganda (so you are soaked in a mono-tone
message), or censorship. The end result is the same, that you are
insulated from alternatives and different opinions, well, if yourself
don't think! The public image of creditable people 
such as doctors and **experts** just to shape your view before you
have one yourself. But don't you see how evil this practice is!!?

No. Marketing and advertisement should not be this way. It started
to bridge the gap between seller and buyer, where buyer already has a
need and seller is providing the service. Yes, new needs are
constantly evolving, shifting, marketing and advertising are
researchers who discover them, not creating them. 

If you examine any of the examples quoted in this talk, you will
realize any of the created-needs came from a human desire far deep
than what marketer can influence &mdash; how about health? Yes, all
the diet product, orange juice story, Q-10.. it's all about human
wants to stay healthy. Period. It's the branch that grows these
leaves, not the other way around.

So when the talk is making it sound marketing has invented these
needs (and is the success story for all future marketers to follow), I
could not disagree more! Stop thinking marketing is to be _super
being_ who can form this world! That's the path leads to another
dictator!! Instead, your mission is to have a deep insight of the
human desire (psychology) and society (social study), and be the
sensor of what is going on at this moment in this country, in this
society, in this world.

Evil politics want to control your mind and tell you what you like and
dislike; marketer and advertisement should not be. They can become one
only when you yourself let them. So pls do me a favor, don't.
