Watching this [youtube][1], it suddenly occurs to me, what I have been
debating with myself &mdash; the [technology and responsibility][2], why
technology needs to reflect on what this technology really means, even
in a hindsight, is better than ignoring its effect, has a root
cause. Yes, it is a **fear**, that once we develop a powerful weapon,
the possibility that it falls into the _wrong hand_ is always
there. Therefore, the more powerful the weapon is, the worse a damage
it will do to us, when _abused_.

That's it!

Now, the question is, when I develop a technology, should I then
consider this possibility, or just brush it aside, "Hey, that's
someone else's job. Let me just focus on make this work." Can I, or
should I?

It seems obvious the answer is, no you shouldn't just ignore it. But
then, if the possibilities are endless, is theren't a way to prove its
negation, right? This is the same as [this book][3] starting off that
even though there is always the possibility, however, certain things
have been proven very unlikely to be true, for example, that a speed
higher than the light speed. Therefore, there can a similar argument
that if we do "so and so", that will reduce the possibility of it
falling into the wrong hand or used in a _wrong way_ so _unlikely_,
that it is ok to develop it.

But then, of course, this also brings another dilemma, that if you
view the world from a physicist's prospective, yeah it won't have
anything than light. But, isn't light speed itself a definition by
physicist? So, it feels like they are both the referee and the player
now. Then, if I change a lens, wouldn't I then suddenly open up a line
of different possibilities? Well, in that matter, who defines the
"wrong" hand anyway!? Terrorist is certainly justified their deeds by
saying they are the savior, and the other guy is the evil.

I don't know. I think it is important for engineers to think more of
their actions and what they mean, even though it seems very
self-defeating and even irrelevant. I think at least there is one
aspect of being an engineer that does put them in the best position to
think about these things &mdash; as the first line solider, they know
the most of the technology, thus having the best information to
evaluate and ponder what they mean, what they can do, for good or for
worse.

Right?
