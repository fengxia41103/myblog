I'm getting used to getting up early to feed them. But I still can't
get used to not thinking of you, when I'm awake, when I'm lying there
in an early winter morning like this. Where are you?

I don't know where you are anymore, nor hear from you of anything in
your life. Sometimes I feel quite upset about this, that I'm now out
of your life, maybe even for the rest of it, that I am nothing but a
stranger to you, like million others in that city, in this world. Yet,
you are not someone whom I only bump into on a street. The days, the
moments kept coming back to me, day and night.

I haven't had a nice afternoon nap like yesterday for a long time.
Noah and his mom were at church. Waking up, a room filled with cozy
sunshine, and zhu wawa cuddling next to me, twisting left and right,
as if don't know how to show off his cuteness and his yearning for
love anymore, stretching stretching, he put his soft paws over my
mouth, as if to say "don't say anything"... it was a moment I felt
genuinely happy, a life with loved one near by, no more, no less. All
of sudden, I realized one thing, that happiness only exists in
moments, and a moment can only be counted in a split of second, then
disappears, becoming a past, becoming only a memory one could think
of, but never able to keep.

I miss you, my dear sunshine, wherever you are, I miss you. I miss the
evening when we sat on top of 南山 watching the city lights under our
feet, miss the day we went out for a day tour roaming around the city,
ended up climbing this little hill and finding a temple with no other
tourist but us, and you tripped on a stair, and I pretended we were
shooting a movie scene, how funny that was! I remember you holding a
stick in hand like a little boy with his sword marching on, remember
arcades when you raced against a group of teenager boys who must have
been fascinated by having someone like you to join. 

You are special. No matter how hard I tried to leave you, to put these
moments to rest, they will not go. There is nothing I can do
about. They are here, to stay. If unhappiness are simply longer, more,
than those happy moments, then happiness has to be sharper, stronger,
to balance, and that's what they are &mdash; these memories, these
moments when I see them like a movie playing in my head, scene by
scene, over and over and over, is what keep me warm, keep me sane. 

Darkness is all over me; you, gave me light.
