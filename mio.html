<p>It has been a long time, I think, to finish a movie like this, without
playing anything in my hand, just sitting there, watching, watching it
without much thought even, of what the story is about, and where it is
going. Like a leave floating on a lake, wave after wave, it goes,
here, there, goes, waving around, may end up here, or there, or,
nowhere.</p>
<p>I think I have been too used to having the mind occupied, by work, by
book, by idea, by an anxiety that time is slipping off my hand, that
I'm getting older and older each day, and it's such an undesirable
feeling, that I feel compelled to think of something, to make the time
count. But hell. Life is pretty pointless, it is a journey, a journey
that has no map, no agenda, no purpose, just a process, someone
somehow puts you on the map, and you have to move, here and there,
till the end of it, and no tell what the end is, or where it
is. Watching so much suffering in this world, in my short life, among
friends and family, expecting a trip to Boston to see uncle Tam next
week w/ Noah, all these, add to the feeling of pointless. It's funny
that the China project received an award yesterday. What a surprise! I
feel I did the least to this project, yet, it brings award, reward,
congratulations... I would have thought it ironical in the past, not
anymore, it's the life itself, it's the truth of life, the only one,
真是无心插柳柳成荫, what do u know, really?</p>
<p>Makes wonder, what is life? what should I do next? Any sense to
expect, anything? Then what's the point of the rest of my time, what
for?... Like her name, Mio, like the sound of a cat meowing,
cute. So it's life, a slow paced life, like a slow moving train,
clonking clonking clonking, unpleasant, not stopping, just clonking,
clonking. Maybe that's why I start to like these Japanese movies,
sometimes even make me wonder that being old is to have a fragile
mind, that I cant enjoy or see the excitements as I used to, instead,
it's the slow motion thing, being it a movie, a music, a train, a
cloud, my cats, it's the slowness that makes me peace. I guess this is
the right way to grow, to spend time with yourself, as insignificant
as a person is comparing to this world, it really feels like a peckle
of dust, disappearing from this world, but makes no difference, and no
one would bother to notice.. a wind would go by, brush it off the face
of this earth, and that would be it.</p>
<p>Spoke to Jookun the other day. He is under a lot of stress these
days. Understand. Kid is leaving nest for college, Uncle Tam is
letting go his fight... it feels sad. I imagined the moment I went to
see him, both happy and sad. I don't know how well I would hold, I'll
try, even though I really don't know. Well, even if I cry, so let it
be, it's how I feel then, and I am sad that he is leaving us for
good... All the older generation has such a day, but w/ all these
mental preparations, it makes slight difference when it's here, just
like sometimes I looked back at my own life, at the dates and loves
and breakups, I could rationalize all of them w/ my words and
thoughts, but in the end, they all felt sad, profoundly sad, like a
cliff and endless land, no end, no end.</p>
<p>I used to think my function is to bring happiness to people around me,
to make their lives better because of me, and I used to think this is
one thing I could do well, and will continue to do so, if all else
fail me. Now, I don't know. I still try, but I feel it's a wall right
in front of my eyes, I don't know now whether I could climb over it, I
even think there is no point of battling because I'm doomed to
lose. Funny the only courage I'm picking up is to think of my mom
&mdash; as much as I have an opinion of her, she has courage, and that
is indeed respectful. I also start to realize how life is going to
abandon everyone, eventually, and living to your own heart is such a
difficult thing that, for me, I have been extremely lucky to do so in
most of the my life so far. Sometimes I wonder how much longer this
life is going to be, maybe it is young, maybe it's ending, both are,
unpleasant.</p>
<p>I don't know. Haven't written for a while. Couldn't feel myself, what
to write, no urge, no thoughts, not much feelings either. Tried to
keep myself busy, but that's totally illusion. Yes there are plenty
things in life to fix and to keep moving. But no, they are all
superficial to the point that I know it's not me, not how I felt. <a href="https://www.amazon.com/gp/video/detail/B08QV47VSG/ref=atv_wl_hom_c_unkc_1_1">Mio
on the Shore</a>, I want a small shop, work hard to keep it open, till
I'm really really old, and that's actually good.</p></p>
