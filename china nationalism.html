    <h1 class="myhighlight">China's Nationalism</h1>
  </div>

  <ol id="toc" class="row"></ol>

    <div id="article-content">
      <p><figure class="col l6 m6 s12">
  <img src="images/funny/glory.jpg"/>
</figure>

<p>What is a <a href="https://www.wikiwand.com/en/Nationalism">nationalism</a>? Is it a bad thing, or a good thing? The
word always reminds me the dawn of WWII that Japan empire was, in my
history education, powered by its fanatic nationalism spirits to
conquer the world and to bring prosperity to its <em>new lands</em>.</p>
<p>What made me think of this word, however, is something that
parallels this feeling, and I don't know yet how to put it
&mdash; China's 大国崛起, its ambition to reestablish its past glory
(presumably existed in history, which I actually have a quite
different opinion), which in many cases involves two themes &mdash; to
get a campus of followers (surrounding neighbours), and to live a life
of the good, old times.</p>
<p>But, this is really troublesome, to me. First of all, the glory of
leadership is a terrible thought. This is consistent of the
hierarchical structure you see everywhere China that somehow someone
must be the <em>boss</em> while everyone else around him/her will be
obedient. Not only this is a social dynamics leading to rigid command
chain thus staleness, but if you ever look at the  countries around
us and ask yourself how many devoted admirers there are, the practical
answer is, <strong>none</strong>. That's right, none. There is no single country
around the China's <em>virtual sphere</em> that will kowtow, because they
look at this giant next door not as a powerful neighbour with a smile
and friendship, but a powerful neighbour with an unpredictable
temper. I don't recall where I picked up this line, but the best
analysis of the image of China was summarized as "Having a big China
is like you are sitting on a subway, and here comes sits down a big
guy next to you with tattoos and no shirt on"... So if we think about
in our life how you will like someone like that, you start to realize
that an affection (between two people) is more about similar taste,
view of the world, education, flavor of coffee, favourate movie,
sports, and so on, rather than a party's sheer power. If the formers
grow apart, one's power can only become a threat instead of a selling
point.</p>
<p>Second, the thought of living the past glory, and to live the good old
time. I constantly find myself wanting to go to the past (of my life)
because I miss the girls I loved and wished a different outcome with
them if I could turn back the clock. So I'm guilty as charged. The
talk about how rich 宋朝 dynasty was, and how wonderful they were
treating people, how well doing people were (according to novels like
金瓶梅) all sound romantic. There might even be a trace of
unsatisfaction of the present because, otherwise, why would you go
back? But if one takes a step back, I think this is really a human
tendency to <em>romanticize the past</em>. Past wasn't that good; it's just
the brain (and history) filtered the unpleasants and left you with all
the happiness and fun. Take 宋朝 for example, the life quality you are
enjoying today is far superior to the emperor back then &mdash; he had
no TV, no car, no fitness center, no flu shot, no ice cream , no plane
to travel, no ipad, no swimming pool, no Nike shoe, no bike, no talk
show, no library, no book store, no coffee shop, no Mozart... 
what he had was just power, human labor, and an illusion of glory
because he truly believed his empire was the center of the universe!
But really, if anyone can hold that type of thoughts (and I actually
have met quite many who do!), they don't need to go back to the past,
they are living the past! &mdash; they all think they are powerful,
and they are the best... give me a break! </p>
<p>If that's the type of price to pay to be glorified again, I don't want
it. It's far better to be humbled because you realize how big the
world is, how diversified people are, how split views of a seemingly
common sense can be, how little you know, and how much you haven't got
chance to learn... everytime I walk into a book store or a museum, I
felt so insignificant because here I was, standing in front of presence
of master minds of human specie who had done something tremendously outstanding,
even vulgar arts count &mdash; they are reality of someone's mind and effort,
so I admire that achievement of 0&rarr;1. So why would one want to
live in a cave just be called a king and feel good about himself?</p>
<p>I think it's all about power, the pipe dream of power, the thought
that the country is now powerful, and I want to be that part of power,
somehow. This, is what I call <strong>Chinese nationalism in the 21st
century</strong>.  How sad, how ridiculous, how dangerous a thought! No,
seriously, you don't want to live in 宋朝 for its so called glory.
Just think about it, <span class="myhighlight">why would you live a
life in which salt is a government monopolized, precious
stuff</span>?... if you are really addicted to power, the last thing
you want is to have someone's finger on your salt supply valve and
grin.</p></p>
