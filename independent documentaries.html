<p>Out of nowhere, I ended up watching three Chinese independent
documentaries. I don't know why. Started the first one only because I
was a bit tired of reading books today and wanted for a change. Then,
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7TjhUdpJcOg">one</a>, <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y60DETlQLs8">two</a>, <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lVvx5TYVS6Q">three</a>... I don't know what to think. The
strange feeling is that, I was initially touched, or disturbed, but
towards the end, I was a bit, calm? numb?</p>
<p>No, don't get me wrong. I think all three are excellent movies. I like
the reality feeling of them, real people, real environment, real
life. I felt the stress, the struggle, the yearn to live and to
prosper, the familiar yet foreign settings of Beijing, of the
peripheral vicinity of the city that was as rural and dirty and
chaotic as I could understand, could picture myself setting foot on,
and have ever been. I don't know what to make out of them. I
understand all the words, but they all are stories of another planet,
another life, that has no similarity to mine, but I don't feel pushed
away. Watching their houses, the young kids at Noah's age, their
parents of my age, what they do, what they eat, how they feel, keeps
me make me think of the four levels in the <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Factfulness-Reasons-World-Things-Better/dp/1250123828/ref=sr_1_1?dchild=1&amp;keywords=factfulness&amp;qid=1618800611&amp;sr=8-1">Factfulness</a>. <strong>Where am
I? and where are they?</strong> I know mine is level 4 according to the book,
and probably an above average of level 4. Is theirs level 3? 2? Is
such one level of difference so, alien!? I don't know, but what got me
to write right now is a feeling that, theirs, are not that different
from mine. Not anymore.</p>
<p>It used to be that I feel I'm living in parallel universe from
theirs. Not only I have no chance to taste their life, I have no
desire to do that, either. Over all my life I had thought myself being
so higher above their life in every aspect that I didn't even feel
there is any necessity to recognize their existence. Yet, now at this
age, not that my life is miserable, well, yet it is, in its own way,
but I don't feel ours are miles apart anymore. Yes they are still
quite different, but no, they are quite the same life, the same agony,
same stress, same hope, same how to make a living, same how to feed
the kids, same how to make some money and get a better life, and same
trying to be recognized by peers, within a circle, grouped w/ friends
and family, admitted by like minds, and sneaked small funs here and
there so the life is colorful, and even cheerful....</p>
<p>The book by Ji Xianlin, <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Cowshed-Memories-Chinese-Cultural-Revolution/dp/1590179269/ref=sr_1_fkmr1_2?dchild=1&amp;keywords=cowshed+jixianlin&amp;qid=1618801032&amp;sr=8-2-fkmr1">Cowshed</a>, gave me the same feeling
today. Such a remote experience, the Cultural Revolution, the Cowshed,
Beijing... I knew little of all these. Yet, his stories, whether
fictional or not, echoed.. no it's not because I wanted to connect w/
the author. I have no feeling of him one way or another. Except his
name I know nothing of his work, nor his reputation. His name is well
known, but I don't even know why so. Yet, walking w/ him through his
journey of those years, he called his heart a mirror of the time, and
each episode of his struggle days, he summarized an image reflected by
his <em>mirror</em>, and that particular analogy, I can't agree more.</p>
<p>Yes. In the last few months I started to feel more and more aware of
what my mind is going through in an experience. Starting w/ that stock
tool, I recognized exactly why I took a fancy of this question, what I
tried, what were the hurdles, and how I felt.. these, footsteps of the
mind, of the heart, became ever more standing out, than before. Why!?
Aging? that my mind is slowing down, thus allowing me to catch a
glimpse of it now, when it used to race like a rocket? That wouldn't
be good. But I would rather think it is because I started to be more
sensitive and clear-minded to such things now. Like a kid who would be
so absorbed by a butterfly that all the rest of the world could have
just disappeared without him know. I used to be a kid's mind. But now,
I'm a grown up... how funny, and how sad, at age 48, I'm finally a
grown up!?</p>
<p>These people in the films, even out of their heavy accents I could
feel it, that I know what's going through him mind, and the same
thought, same reasoning, have been in mine, also. Even more than this,
his reasoning is loud, clear, practical, and a good one.. really, I
couldn't do any better than he has done if I were in his
shoes. Period. These people, these, used to be nearly illiterate in my
mind, have performed extraordinarily well, in this same exam we are
in, called, living a life.</p>
<p>I can't say I admire them. No I don't. I still know well that many
thing I know how to, they don't. But this same statement is now mutual
&mdash; many things they do w/ ease, I don't know where to start. I
don't feel they could ever be as good an engineer as I am if were
given a chance. But I highly doubt myself being as good as they are,
either, if given the swap. I think in the end of day, the root cause
of my feeling is a loss of self-confidence. Perhaps.</p>
<p>Bravery. Courage. I used to think I have plenty of them. I have stood
up to things I didn't like. I have stood up for strangers to protect
them. I have stood up to friends for her causes. But with aging,
watching yourself become weaker, uglier, less attractive, less
competitive, less polished, less, everything, takes courage, calls for
bravery, and a lot, a lot of them.</p>
<p>I start to understand mom's choice of insisting living alone. I start
to admire her courage of watching herself and dad going into not just
age, but loss. Yes, she is a hero, indeed, even though I still hold a
grudge against her, I think she is one brave soul, and I could only
wish I would have her endurance and strength, to face the
deterioration, to face the sunset of a life, to face the inevitable of
being lonely, being forgotten, being miserable, being ill, being in
pain, being pushed around, but still stand up straight, and be
alright.</p>
<p>That's what these films have, bravery, courage, a fire to live and to
prosper, an energy, that I admire. Bravo for these film makers! I'll
try.</p></p>
