What a surprise! Went to have dinner w/ Noah together yesterday. A
cold winter day. And he went to Publix by himself, and got me a bag of
chocolate!!!!! Oh mine mine mine!!!! This is the very first gift I
ever received from him, all by himself, without me ever saying a word
about it, reminding him of anything, or even thinking about it!!!
Indeed he is growing up now. Soon I guess he will leave the nest and
fly away to find his own path. I'm gonna miss him. I know that
already. Yet, it's a happy moment if that comes, I think, that seeing
him growing into a big guy, and a kind heart, is the best prize I
could ever hope for in this life. Sometimes I wonder, that what is the
meaning of my life? After 2006 I knew I have a big role to play in
this family. Yet I tried, but I don't think I did a good job. I wish I
could be wiser, more patient, more tolerant, more of everything. But
it's the inevitable shortcoming, I suppose, that I need these hiccups
and failures to grow. People around me paid price, bore the
burden. But one thing I could say to myself, is that I never did a
thing with intention to harm, especially if it were for my own's
benefit. All the blunders I caused, though can't be excused as
accident, was sincere mistake. I wish Noah would be a wiser guy than I
was. Not only then he would be a better person, but a happier person,
with less regret. I don't think regret is a terrible thing, actually,
because one only regrets things that are dear to him/her, which speaks
that s/he cared, felt, and touched the heart. I think it's better to
regret, so to feel the pain, and the joy, too, even though things
didn't work out the way you wished, but the feeling of it, the soul
touching moment, the memory you may still have, are worth the
agony... after all, walking through this life, you live only once,
nothing really matters towards the end, only the soul, the mind, the
heart, and hopefully, by then, also tears.

Reorganizing the online album, flipped through some built over the last four
five years. I'm quite impressed by how many I have done! The two
albums are still wonderful. Four years, two years, felt like a moment
just passed by... how funny, but also, how terribly sad... it has been
a while... I don't feel it anymore. Guess if living without a person
to miss, time doesn't really matter, it stops, you move along day by
day, older and older, but the best of you were frozen in time, doesn't
walk with you anymore... it just stood there, where you were... More
and more, I start to feel this life is not real, more and more I feel
the walking me isn't me anymore... it's like me watching a stranger's
life, I'm just watching, feeling something, but not much, as if his
isn't relevant much to myself... why so? Is this the feeling of losing
control? but, what is control then? and did I ever have it?... I
doubt. This is a feeling of disengagement, disengaging from this life,
from everything around, everybody around... it isn't a hermit, just
lost interest in these things, not even much of self, just lost
interest... there are still joy, music, laugh, topics I think,
discussion I do, talks I listen, moments I like... but overall, it's
cold, cold inside... all the efforts are to keep the candle burning,
but it's flicking, flicking, flicking, not much there.

A beautiful weather today. Walked w/ doggie in downtown Chapel
Hill. Quiet. Warm sun. A few pedestrians here and there. A couple
joints were open. Few cars... felt like walking into a movie in which
the town was deserted... and there was no zombies, no disasters
coming... just the two of us, walking slowly... he sniffed around, but
didn't pick up any food from the ground, to my surprise... I guess he
felt the same relaxing atmosphere as I did. No store. No shop. Just a
winter day.
