# problem

[original post][1]

<div class="problem_content" role="problem">
  <p>
    You are given the following information, but you may prefer to do
    some research for yourself.
  </p>
  <ul>
    <li>1 Jan 1900 was a Monday.</li>
    <li>Thirty days has September,<br>
      April, June and November.<br>
      All the rest have thirty-one,<br>
      Saving February alone,<br>
      Which has twenty-eight, rain or shine.<br>
      And on leap years, twenty-nine.
    </li>
    <li>
      A leap year occurs on any year evenly divisible by 4, but not on
      a century unless it is divisible by 400.
    </li>
  </ul>
  <p>
    How many Sundays fell on the first of the month during the
    twentieth century (1 Jan 1901 to 31 Dec 2000)?
  </p>
</div>

# solution

[code][2].

* **problem space**: `1/1/1901 - 12/31/2000`
* **test criteria**: 
    1. is 1st day of a month?
    2. is Sunday?

Such a small problem space that it is not necessary to overthink this
problem. Iterate and check:

```python
from datetime import date
from datetime import timedelta

def main():
    count = 0
    start = date(1901, 1, 1)
    while start.year < 2001:
        # check requirements
        # 1. 1st day of a month
        # 2. is a Sunday
        if start.day == 1 and start.weekday() == 6:
            count += 1
            print start

        start += timedelta(days=1)

    print count
```
