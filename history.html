<p>Reading <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Rape-Nile-Robbers-Tourists-Archaeologists/dp/0813340616">The rape of the Nile</a>, quite a fascinating book.
It's rather surprising how recent these events were &mdash;
we are talking about the mid-19th century, what, about 150 years ago?
In prospective, the history of Egypt and its glorious monuments have
been around for much longer than that.</p>
<h1>reality of the past</h1>
<p>What really bothers me, however, is how the people at those days were
treating these ancient artifacts back then &mdash; just like the
horror propaganda I have been told about China's treasure being looted
and trashed by barbarians of both foreign and domestic origin (and
admittedly much more by the domestic ones), the same theme of sadness
was playing in Egypt, over and over and over again. Pyramids were used
for quarrying building materials, and artifacts were given as a token
to influential whoever the ruler was trying to please. At the end of
the day, no one was looking at them as arts of unreplaceable
value. They were free gifts left over by ancient anonymous &mdash;
cheap as dirt, and only meaningful to one when it could bring glory,
fame, profit, or the things s/he wants at that given moment. There was
no perpetual value, no inherited value, certainly no emotional value
worth preservation, and much less of responsible value by making them
available for the generations to come &rarr; consume and dispose them
now, by me, period.</p>
<h1>"unfairness", in a hindsight</h1>
<p>But then, if you feel it is clear now to see how terrible those deeds
were, I kept wondering how to justify this view when I'm really
reading all these from a distant <strong>present</strong>, or to say looking from a
rear view mirror. I hold a different prospective than those in the
book at the time. You can call it a progress of civilization as we are
now understanding more of its history (since no one was even able to
read the Egyptian words till the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rosetta_Stone">Rosetta stone</a>, and even that
took a few decades before it was deciphered), thus its importance and
value. But does it state that it's not fair to those people we call
<em>barbarians</em> these days since they were really operating in a
disadvantage comparing to what we know today? Well, then why being
<em>fair</em> is a measure of good or bad anyway? who said it must be <em>fair</em>?
If you throw these out, then how does one look at so called
<strong>history</strong> and opinionate it one way or the other? After all, each
holds his own life experience as the only foundation he could relate
and refer to. So it becomes a completly random chance that someone's
reference happens to match the one that later gets realized 
and is labelled as a <strong>human progress</strong>, which then leads them
standing out as the pioneer and a great mind, while in reality, who
the heck know what it is going to be tomorrow!? </p>
<h1>right of the advanced</h1>
<p>Further, when western museums were the buyer who drove all the tomb
robbers and antique traders, the sad reality back then was that local
folks didn't give a fxxx of all the mummies and monuments. So now fast
forward 150 years, it is just not reasonable
to <strong>blame</strong> them for collecting them in the name of <code>loot</code>
or <code>steal</code>. Their argument is valid &mdash; the antiques did have a
better chance to be preserved and to survive, and they did have a
better vision (if can be called enlightened) of the future than
others. But this leads to another dilemma.</p>
<p>Does it then mean that a so called <em>advanced</em> group or society should
be in position to take over things from a <em>less advanced</em> group so to
maximize the overall benefits of, what, society? human race?
history?... I don't find a word to describe this. But you see what I'm
driving towards right? This argument definitely feels, not right
morally, but right factually. Let's say we let them do that, and the
future proves they were right &larr; both of these are pretty
<strong>SIGNIFICANT</strong> assumptions. But does it mean that the less advanced
group will be locked in their inferior position/class forever? If I
enjoy the benefit of taking over others' stuff, what incentive do I
have to educate them and lift them up out of their existence so to
<em>compete</em> with me!? Isn't this the exact thought any privileged
subject has and wish to maintain, forever!? So the elites rule us all,
because even you are the <em>privileged</em> one, chances are you are not the 
single top guy of the food chain, then by this reasoning it derives
that you will also be ruled, crashed, bullied, and wasted, maybe just
with a slight less degree of destruction, but the idea is the
same. Well, then why do you want to promote that!?</p>
<h1>history === myth</h1>
<p>How confusing! I think this whole mess of arguments really lead to the
problem that there is no <em>compass</em> in my life these days and the line
between right and wrong is completly blurred (or just disappeared). 
I lost faith in the future, has serious contempt of the present, and
has a shaky feeling of the past. <a href="https://en.wikiquote.org/wiki/George_Santayana">Santayana</a> warned that "
Those who do not learn history are doomed to repeat it." But what you
learned from history isn't really a truth or even fact, but a
hindsight of judgement which itself could just be a complete wrong
in the next few decades because of the prospective shift. Then, what
could one really learn from so called history, if anything?</p>
<p>马未都说："历史没有真相，只残存一个道理". Now even this seems over
optimistic. There isn't even a 道理, just a story, a legend,
a myth. So to this point, history doesn't really matter much, nor it
has any value in anything. Its left over artifacts are valuable, when
they have a market (which means someone wants it for $$). If no one
wants it, oh well, they are just a whole pile of dirt regardless what
they are named, mummy, gold, or whatever.</p>
<h1>"Epilogue"</h1>
<p>I am quoting the "epilogue" chapter of <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Rape-Nile-Robbers-Tourists-Archaeologists/dp/0813340616">the book</a>, which I feel draw a clear
picture of paradox of history that barbarians whom we so disgust
today, who looted the Niles with selfish motivation ONLY,
in the end became the driving force, though brutal and even
uncivilized judged by these days' standars, 
created a repository of treasure, even unintentionally, so
we living in this century still have some to look at and to admire. If
left to the <em>rightful owner</em> of them (the locals, but who said they
have the right?), many we see today would have been
long gone, consumed as a trivial heating bundle in winter and
supersititious medicine, whose usage and purpose we scorn even
more I suppose, comparing to their dark fate of being moved from their
origin to a foreign location as monument, as cash machine, as a ladder
to fame and fortune for some, but in the end, as an inheritage of mankind. </p>
<blockquote>
<p>Over a hundred and fifty years have passed since Giovanni Belzoni
shook the dust of Alexandria off his feed for the last time. But many
familiar scenes would greet his eyes if he were to return to the Nile
today. The pyramids still tower above the floodplain, while the Sphinx
crouches at their feed surrounded by curious tourists. The sun still
rises in a gray dawn, lights up the vast spaces of the desert, and
highlights the fertile green and cultivated land by the banks of the
Nile. The shimmering heat of midday embraces the heavy air of temple
and royal bomb in the same way that it has for centuries. White-sailed
river vessels retrace the course taken by Belzoni's ramshackle boats
and pass the scenes of this greatest exploits. There is a sense of
timelessness about the Nile that transcends the passage of years or
the stirring events of history. The visitor to the Nile can smell the
same smells as the Ancient Egyptians, of hot dust and damp reeds, of
the river itself as it flows smoothly toward the north. Every year,
like clockwork, the Nile comes down in flood, ensuring the fertility
of crops and perpetuating agricultural practices that are often little
modified from pharaonic times. One can almost sense that elusive
feeling of equilibrium and ma&prime;et, that sense of rightness so
highly prized by the Ancient Egyptians as they identified with their
unchanging environment.</p>
<p>Belzoni had come to the Nile at a time when the full extend of the
glories of Ancient Egypt had just been revealed to the world for the
first time. The coolections of Napoleon's savants had electrified the
scholars of Europe and a craze for things Egyptian had swept the
cultivated drawing rooms of European capitals. The Rosetta Stone had
reached the British Museum; the Louvre in Paris had just unpacked its
spoils from the Nile. A surge of nationalistic lust for the precious
and exotic was filling these museums and those in other countries with
all manner of curiosities and the finest artistic achievements of
Western civilization. And Egyptian antiquities were at the top of the
curators' shopping lists. Thus the scramble for Ancient Egypt began, a
campaign of looting conducted in the name of diplomacy and leisured
cultural inquiry, which soon degenerated into an orgy of destruction,
greed, and outright profiteering. As in other parts of the world,
archaeology began as treasure hunting and then slowly evolved into a
scientific discipline armed with all the specialist methods and
techniques of the twentieth-century fieldworker. But by the time the
scientific archaeologist arrived, much of the Ancient Egypt was gone
forever, devoured by the voracious maw of the treasure hunter,
unscrupulous collection, or curious tourist.</p>
<p>Napoleon's mena were only human in their desire to collect Egyptian
antiquities, for the urge to collect and posses is one of the more
passionate of human desires. Time and time again the early
archaeologist was overcome with a passion to excavate, loot, or just
remove the past to another place, where he could caress it and
contemplate its glories without the disturbing qualities of its
original context. Soon European antionalism and the petty ambitions of
dislomats and statesmen became involve in the collecting business, as
many nations sought to acquire a fine repository of the most
beautiful, exotic, and valuable manifestations of Ancient Egyptian
civilization. It became fashionable to be knowledgeable about Ancient
Egyptin all its nostalgic and fascinating glory. Egypt was the epitome
of ancient civilization, that of a strong and powerful society that
had oppressed the Israelities, suffered from the Mosaic plagues, and
taken a conspicuous place in the established order of world
history. Unfortunately, knowledge coincided with ownership and profit
in many people's minds.</p>
<p>In a sense one cannnot blame the museum curator or collector of a
century and a half ago for the attitudes that they
possessed. Everywhere they looked they saw statuary and temples being
broken up and tombs being looted for jewelry. In Egypt nothing was
safe. But a papyrus carefully unrolled in the secluded comfort of the
British Museum was safe from destruction, cushioned with the awesome
security of the greates museum in the world. After all, as Wallis
Budge pointedly remarked, a mummy displayed in the British Museum was
very priuvileged compared with his cousins in the looted tombs of
Thebes. No on could desecrate a British Museum mummy or tear it
apart. The outrageous tactics of private purchase and surreptitious
excavation in definance of authority were condoned in the comfortable
certainty that they were the only practicable way to save Ancient
Egypt from extinction. What need, asked many people, did the Egyptians
have for their past? After all, the pasha's government was destroying
and giving it away all the time. And the fellahin seemed to have no
respected for tomb or temple or any identity with the Ancient
Egyptians themselves, only in the value of their corpses. There was
non of the local nationalistic sentiment that had stirred vigorous
public outcry in Greece when Lord Elgin removed the marble friezes
that bear his name in the British Museum from the portico of the
Parthenon. The well-heeled museum collection and tourist of a century
and a half ago was fully aware that the Ancient Egyptians themselves
had helped themselves to the contents of royal tombs. They had
viuolated their most sacred places and the royal sepulchers for gold
and a guaranteed source of wealth that would enable them to meet
life's day-to-to needs. The ancients had treated the past with a
causal cynicism that had been inherited by their successors, a
cynicism that was mathed with equal contempt by the nineteenth-century
collector. It is a miracle that anything at all has survived for us to
enjoy.</p>
<p>Without question, however, much of Ancient Egypt's magnificent splendor
was saved from oblivion by the aggressive policies of Wallis Budge and
other &mdash; witness, to mention only a few instances, not only
Belzoni's collections, but also the Papyrus of Ani, the best and most
complete version the Book of the Dead, and the thousands of Coptic
manuscripts in the Louvre and the British Museum. By displaying their
acquisitions, the officials of major European museums, however
unscrupulous their methods, made possible a heightened awareness of
the need to learn about Ancient Egypt and to save it for proterity
before it all vanished forever.</p>
<p>Fortunately, when one looks back over the history of Egyptology one
views a landscape peopled by giants. Jean Francois Champollion and
John Gardner Wikinson unlocked the secrets of hieroglyphs. August
Mariette excavated for the Louvre and then became the first jealous
guardian of Ancient Egypt for serious scholar and tourish
alike. Flinders Petrie introduced modern excavation methods to the
Nile. The genius of Champollion and the passionate vagor of Mariette
resulted in the gradual creation of an organization designed to thwart
destruction and inevitable oblivion. Egypt became the first Near
Eastern country to possess a national museum, even if it began life as
a ramshackle shed in a back garden in Cairo, and even if its contents
were occasionally donated to influential visiting
dignitaries. Gradually the diplomats turned from antiquities to
political activities, while more and more people came to look rather
than loot. Egypt itself became an interesting place to visit, with the
great pyramids and temples as part of a backdrop for a thoroughly
entertaining vacation.</p>
<p>In a sense, it was the tourist and the educated dilettante who saved
Ancient Egypt. Egypt's first Antiquities Ordinance was promulgated in
1835 and was largely ignored by those it sourght to control, for there
were no mechanisms or facilities to enforce it. Ironically, it was the
looted antiquities in European museums that caused a rising tide of
public opinion to react against the orgy of destruction. People had
admired the fine statuary in the Louvre, felt that such fine
achievements belonged to the world at large and that everyone had the
right to enjoy them. There was a slow realization that fanatics like
Mariette were correct, and that the flaboyant director of the Bulak
Museum was right to offend the covetous Empress Eugenie with here
imperious demands. Besides, tourism was good business for everyone:
for the properity of foreign trade, for European political interests
in the near East, for the Egyptians, and for the tourists
themselves. How could there be any tourism if there were no temples,
tombs, or museum collections for the visitor to admire?</p>
<p>The studied logic and efficient bureaucracy of Britical rule in Egypt
finally created, albeit slowly, a change in public attitudes within
Egypt itself. Amelia Edwards journeyed through Egypt at the beginning
of a long period of relative political stability, when the Antiquities
Service began to develop a network of guards and active intelligence
agents employed to prevent illegal collecting and the further rape of
Ancient Egypt. Of course, there were incidents of scandalous
corruption and brazen tomb robbing, some of them associated with
respectable museums, but the tilde of public attitude and
archaelogical morality had turned imperceptibly in favor of
preservation and scientific excavation. Even those who chose to paint
their names on the great temples were publicly excoriated for their
conspicuous sins. It became harder to remove antiquities from Egypt
and more fashionable to consider the Cairo Museum as one of the
foremost repositories for Ancient Egypt in the world, a museum soon to
be staffed by Egyptians themselves.</p>
<p>The stolid facade of the British Empire fostered a risiging sense of
nationalism in Egypt, ad elsewhere, a latent resentment of foreign
rule and British imperialism, a greater identity with the long and
fascinating kaleidoscope of history that the Egyptians could look back
upon. This nationalism manifested itself in political events, which
are familiar to us all, but also in an abhorrence of a "cultural
imperialism" that chose to remove the choicest achievements of
antiquity to foreign climates. The magnificient  discovery of the
undisturbed tomb of Tut-ankh-Amun in 1922 merely fueled the sentiment
against foreign excavation and exploitation of Ancient Egypt, although
Lord Carnarvon gave the royal tomb's contents to the Cairo Museum. By
the 1920s foreign expeditions were rarely found in Egypt, for there
were few rewards for well-financed museum expeditions that depends on
rich finds to attract generous benefactors. A long drawn-out stand-off
between the acquisitors of major foreign museums and the Egyptian
Antiquities Service reflected a hardened attitude, one where sharing
of a unique cultural heritage with other nations was morally
unacceptable. Few scholars were able to dig in Egypt on the scale that
archaeologists like Petrie had regarded as commonplace. It is only
recent years that Egypt has opened its doors to foreign archaeologists
again, this time on a carefully controlled scale.</p>
<p>But now the international climate for archaeology has changed, in a
world that is ardently nationalist and increasingly jealous of its
diverse cultural heritages. People are far more aware of enormous
contribution that the discipline can make to the proper study of
humankind. Today, they wealth of Ancient Egypt is spread through the
museums of several continents. Mummy after mummy, sarcophagus after
sarcophagus, statue after statue, museum storerooms and galleries, are
filled with the dusty remains of Egyptian antiquity. Most were
acquired by private collectors and then donated to the museums, or
acquired in massive field seasons, supported by private donations,
where often quantity was more important thant quality. The large
expeditions and casual collecting forays of half a century ago have
been replaced by an illegal antiquities traffic that feeds on the law
of supply and demand and the avaricious acquisition policies of large
museums and wealthy collectors. Journalist Karl Meyer has documented
this nefarious trade with its long ancestry in the activities of
Belzoni and his kind in <em>The Plundered Past</em>, a devastating indictment
of the mechanics of the twentieth-century antiquities trade. Meyer
describes public consciousness of the seriousness of hte problem as
being at about "stage zero", for the importantce of archaeology and
its significance to humankind is something that is theoretically easy
to understand, has been rarely discussed at length in print, and is
far harder to comprehend in practice. It is certainly almost
impossible to persuade taxpayers to pay for archaeology when the
thorny issue of limited resources and ordered priorities comes up.</p>
<p>...</p>
<p>The passion ofr collecting dies hard, especially in times of recession
or mushrooming art prices. Nor does it perish in the face of attitudes
like those of New York art dealer Andre Emmerich who was bold enough
to say in public a few years ago that he thought the United States
"more than any other [country] has a special claim to the arts of all
mankind." We live in what are sometimes called enlightened times, but
they can hardly be described as enlightened in terms of antiquity, as
long as these sorts of attitudes pervade public thinking. Many
archaeologists are wondering if there is a future for the past and
some fear that Ancient Egypt is faced with total extinction. But let
us take heart from the immortal and inspired words of the great Jean
Francois Champollion:</p>
<p><strong>Egypt is always herself, at all stages in her hitory, always great
and powerful in art and enlightenment. Going backthrough the
centuries, we see her always shining with the same brilliance, and the
only thing we lack to satisfy our curiosity is a knowledge of the
origin and growth of civilization itself.</strong></p>
<p>As these pages have shown, at least something has been done to satisfy
Champollion's, and our, curiosity.
