This thought has been haunting me for a while now since I was
listenning to 罗辑思维 while in Shanghai in 2016. I really enjoyed the
talks to the point that siqi joked that 罗辑 was becoming my
idol. Well, that certainly was not happening and would never happen
&mdash; I enjoyed it because of the new information of history which I
was both familiar with and strange of, partially derived from my
deficient formal and self- education on these topics, partially
because I never thought of them this way. Nonetheless, I found topics
intriguing and fun and had some really good point &mdash; the analogy
of training passing by a platform as he described how progress of AI
will pass human advantages.

But anyway, I disliked tremendously when I first watched his annual
presentation, which strongly mimiced Steven Jobs and a grand
powerpoint. I was disgusted not by the form or the content, but how he
was giving credits to those successful business men sitting in honory
seats &mdash; yes they have done a great job in their own right; no I
get it, it's a licking butt, giving face, and a fxxk banquet of an
elite club of millionaires.

That's not the what I want to talk about in this article. A
detour. What really bugs me is the thought of how I am acquiring
information and knowledge. On one hand I take pride of myself of being
independent thinker, cynical, even over-critical; on the other hand,
even with all the books I am reading, I wonder that with the unique
view that author is presenting and I'm deep into it at this moment,
how do I know which side of the coin I am looking at? If I think
people who rely on reader's digest for information is lazy and biased,
am I really that different? Isn't what I see and read also just a
version of a digest? Even worse, author of the reader digest often
than not is a better writer, better analyst, better domain expert,
than I am, so his/her view and summary of the book/article/whatever
should have a better quality, depth, accuracy, thus a higher density
of information, than what I could derive through my own effort. So in
this light, me as a person who always to advocate efficiency, is
actually taking a path of lower efficiency in acquiring information!

Many many times I felt sorry for those upper management who was
litening to my presentation. My view is that their channel of
information came from my PPT, which truly I feel is just a tunnel view
of the subject, even though I honestly wasn't having any intention of
manipulating their perception. But it is inevitable. The slides bear a
stamp of my perception, and is completly limited to my own way of
thinking and understanding &mdash; and mine could be well off track
from what the _truth_ is. But then, with so many projects going on
and so many new technologies, buzz words, subordinates and daily
meetings, even by design for their role in work, they have been deprived of
having hands-on experience to obtain the level of details that I have.
Therefore, they have not choice but to play the _managerial pride_
because that's the only way they could mask their lack of confidence
in front of someone who has done the work many times over and know a
whole lot of details. But this is pathetic, don't you think?


Anyway, from my previous argument, learning from PPT is also more
efficient than me studying everything by myself. To think of it, even
going to school is an experience of learning from someone's reader's
digest, isn't it?  Professor had more knowledge and experience with
the subject, s/he picked a book, taught us a few things about the
subject, and influenced with s/he own personal view of what topic in
this field holds a higher priority and excitement. Therefore, learning
from reader's digest is not an evil, nor an outlier, but a necessity,
a norm, a must.

But but, I still have a strong feeling against program like 罗辑思维
when it **preached** the idea of "let me read, for you". This ideology
bothers me. I appreciate a venue to learn a summary of a book, even an
opinion (or opinions) through such a program. But it being an only,
or even an primary information channel, **is not healthy** I would
say. Regardless how well the digest sounds, it is a distilled version,
and it is not **your version**. There is nothing wrong to adopt it as
your version if you feel so, but always bear in mind that it is one
way to look at things, not The way. More importantly, **it should
trigger a train of thought that disturbs you more than it gives you
anwsers &mdash; it demonstrates how ignorant one is (how can I never
heard of this before!?), and how ignorant one is about one's
ignorance**!

I think reading, listening to these digests are fine and a must. But
don't stop there. If it is a topic that interest you dearly, dig in,
you will be shocked how deep all rabbit holes go. The evil of 罗辑思维
or any digest is when it prints in large font "all you need to know"
on package &mdash; that is not a summarized knowledge anymore, that
has become a dose of opium numbing your soul.
