    <h1 class="myhighlight">Development</h1>
  </div>

  <ol id="toc" class="row"></ol>

  <div>
    <div id="article-content">
      <p><p>This is a quite fascinating argument, and quite unexpected when I'm
reading this book, <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Mosquitoes-Malaria-Man-History-Hostilities/dp/0525160256">Mosquitoes, Malaria and Man</a>.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>As  for typing  public health  efforts to  development, WHO  takes its
stand  on  popular  but  treacherous ground.  One  reason  eradication
failed, the argument  goes, is that governments were  not convinced it
was   worthwhile  and   were  unwilling   to  push   it  or   pay  for
it.  Malariologists, negelected  to bring  out cost-benefit  models to
prove that it may pay more than it costs to keep people healthy.</p>
<p>Now it is  notoriously difficult to put a value  on human life, though
many  economists are  perennially  willing to  try.  But the  exercise
becomes superficially plausible if you  assume that development is the
social objective, axiomatically to be  considered good, by which other
values are tested. Then the worth of  a man may be reckoned as what he
contributed  during  a   normal  life  span  to   the  gross  national
product. If he dies prematurely the  years of useful labor cut off are
lost and consistute a social cost. If  he is by a measurable amount of
his assumed potential. And that is  economic loss. All these costs may
be charged  to a  malaria if  malaria is the  villain, along  with the
direct  expenses  of  treatment,  and  weighed  against  the  cost  of
eliminating the disease or reducing it by any given amount.</p>
<p>If the  model predicts that  fighting disease pays, then  the exercise
can seem as harmless as it  ought to seem superfluous. But suppose the
fight  is  found  not  to  pay.  As  the  whole  point  of  running  a
cost-benefit model is to sway governments presumed to be responsive to
that kind of  argument, would they not be under  as strong pressure to
forgo malaria  control when the  model lights  turn red as  to proceed
when they are green?</p>
<p><strong>Unpleasant as  is that proffered  choice, in the name  of economic
reason, to buy or not to buy lives, there is still a more unpleasant
middle ground: To buy certain  lives and sacrifice others</strong>. WHO has
come  perilously  close to  recommending  that  governments do  just
that. As a  limited war against malaria by  definition cannot extend
to  the  protection  of  all  people, a  suggested  strategy  is  to
concentrate  on protecting  those people  in society  whose economic
contributions are most important  &mdash; workers in key industries,
producers of  cash crops, those who  labor to build roads,  dams and
other capital  improvements, in short  all those who are  useful for
development.</p>
<p>This implies a curious and dismaying  reversal of values. It used to
be argued  that development  was a good  thing because  it benefited
people; now we seem on the point  of agreeing to have blushed at the
implication  that  human  life  was  to  be  protected  only  as  it
contributed to the gross national  product. No politician appears to
have protested  the cynicism  thus imputed to  political leadership.
Everyone is busy  being "realistic."  <strong>If you want to  do good in a
world so obsessed with development that  it allows only two kinds of
nation, the  developed and  the developing, you  have to  prove that
doing good is one way to develop</strong>.</p>
<p>Failure  of the  idea  of mosquito  eradication has  in  truth left  a
vacuum.  Nations such  as  India, that  came such  a  long way  toward
abolishing the  ancient malarial scourge,  do not want it  back; their
governments in fact have no real  political choice but to continue the
fight.  Yet the  warriors remain  disprited,  badly in  need of  fresh
purpose.</p>
<p>It may  be that the most  damaging legacy of eradication  has been the
mental conditioning  it fostered.  The eradicators  developed military
minds: The game, they thought, must go to  them or to us, win or to be
defeated.  But there  were skeptics  of the  eradication strategy  all
along who  protested that  this was  not the real  choice in  the real
world where man habitually copes with recurrent and perennial problems
that he  can never hope  to resolve  and put away  forever. Protecting
ourselves against  the malarial  plasmodium can  be accepted  as quite
probably a task for all tiime without being daunted by the prospect.</p>
<p>Malarial  fighters  have been  a  mercurial  lot, subject  to  intense
enthusiasms  and deep  discouragements. Yet  their own  history should
hearten them.  Unless The  End is finally  here, current  doldrums are
also  part  of   that  history,  they  are   therefore  interlude  not
culmination.
</p>
</blockquote>
<p>So in name of development, as it is another "-ism", those that do not
benefit the course of it will be deemed unworthy. Again, I found
emphasis on individual, value and right of an individual, is
constantly being challenged, if not at all denied, by these "in the
name of <fill in your label>" <em>beliefs</em>. </p>
<p>I  recall  listening to  Jeffery  Sachs  at  BU  when he  argued  that
perpetual progress is  neither possible nor practical  &mdash; even if
we believe in that universe is inifite, traveling straight towards one
direction will  only bring us back  to where we are.  Economy progress
and development can not go upwards  forever, and I think his point was
that it should not, either. Implication is not only that all resources
on earth will not be enough to support everyone living like Americans,
but this story  of malaria highlighted another aspect  when things are
viewed in a cost-benefit model.</p>
<p>Written in  1978, this argument  has yet convinced mass  to reconsider
the path we are  on, achievements we yearn for, value  of life (as the
Chinese have gone through mania of the  age of success in the last few
years, when preaching of success was  the talk of the day), whether we
can only  go forward, in  a forever  motion of moving  faster, growing
bigger, richer.</p>
<p>I  don't know  whether there  is  a cap  of  human society,  be it  in
population,  in wealth,  in  resource consumption,  in creativity,  in
imagination,  in  invention of  disaster,  in  fostering bias  and  in
correction of  faults.... In theory  I would  think there is  an upper
limit. I'm just living at the tip of its early phase, I suppose. There
is a long way to go, I hope.  </p></p>
