Summary: A prototype is the only effective way to solve a complex problem because
    it translates abstract concepts into a solid example. However it may be flawed
    comparing to its production version, it provides a common target that now
    end users and development team can discuss, modify and feedback on. By framing
    both sides into this common _playground_, a shared vocabulary will emerge
    which in turn clarifies communication and creates efficiency.


Have you noticed how your past projects failed? In one interview we had with a client,
we were asked by

Once the nature of the problem has been _communicated_, _understood_
and _agreed_, could the process of problem solving starts. In our past
projects we saw signs of progress by observing the quality of
questions asked and how quickly vocabularies converge. A good question
brings out good discussion, which bring us closer to the core of
problem on hand; a converging vocabulary clarifies communication, making
the team work accurate and efficient.
