The past weekend was the big moving day. Things actually went pretty
well, except the morning pick up of U-Haul. What a terrible customer
service they had! Well, it started with my fault really by forgetting
to bring my driver license. Nonetheless, the only service was not
helpful &larr; and it's just another example of [euphemism][1] that
it gave an error message to retry during business hours of the
self-service pickup location (which was closed for Sunday, btw, wtf!),
and what it really meant, thanks for the last representative who
revealed it to me, was that my account was blocked for any further
self-service and my only option was to find a U-Haul location that was
open and have a real person to help me. Really, once again, euphemism
never works for anybody because **it doesn't specify action to take to
move things forward!** Make it clear, as precise and actionable as
possible, so to remove and minimize lost in translation. An ambiguity
like that isn't a sign of politeness. Instead, it is a sign of
arrogance and apathy, and smells especially bad in customer service.

Moving is tiring. Really. It's not bad this time to move all the stuff
since most of the stuff are already in boxes (and never left there
since Boston). And also, I like my way of minimal living, that makes
moving less of a heaache, for me, at least. One thing coming out of
this life fiasco is that I learned to live on mininum, and started to
realize how little one needs, physically and materially &mdash; things
you could put away for a week or two, you can safely discard them
without harming your way of living anymore than they would do to you
if being kept around, moved around, attached as if they were necessary
but they are practically useless. On the other hand, a minimal living
emphasizes how much one would need to fill in this gap with mind, with
soul, with emotion, with love, with something inner, someone to miss,
some days to think of, some part of life to regret... 

I miss those days. I miss those people. I read books, give thoughts to
a lot of sayings. I try to make sense of this world, make sense of
people, history, society, try to figure out what is important to me,
important to others, important to Noah. I get angry sometimes, because
those BS annoys me to hell; I get calmer than before, too, because I
can see through so many things and people now that I know what they
are trying to do, and I feel it's really just up to me to decide
whether I want to be part of this BS, if at all (and most likely I
won't be, cause that will annoy me even further because now it will be
myself being part of the annoyance, and I can't get rid of myself,
what a pity).

Friday is approaching. There is actually relief between us because
there is no suspension anymore &mdash; it's done, it will be done. I
have been preaching to Noah that if **it is something you care enough about,
make it happen, don't wait around**. While saying that I always wonder
on the back of my mind what this meant to us &mdash; do I really care
so much about being official that way? Once upon in life I wished I
were available then to be with her and gave her what she wanted. 
I feel this is a step I'm taking for myself so that myself knows I was
serious, sincere, and truthful. It's how I felt, how I feel, and how I
should have done, for both of them. Timing didn't play out,
again, which is perhaps the theme of my life, or a curse? No
matter. Destiny has its own course, and I don't want to guess nor
expect. Whatever it may be, I am just hoping I can stay true, to
myself and to others I care about &mdash; I sincerely live a life
without ever thinking to hurt or harm the ones I loved and cared. If
consequence of a mistake is hurtful just the same with or without a
sincerity, I think having one is still better than having none. It's a
selfish act I feel &larr; I care how I judge myself, but none how
others judge me.

Is this bad? I don't know. It is my way.

Peace.

PS. Books and bookshelves make me happy. I like the new bookshelves
and my collection of books. I have been thinking by the day I go away,
which book I would bring with me, if there were only one, or a few? I
don't know yet. I like [Practicing History][2]. She has a sharp
tongue, and cut-through pen. I like it. While reading it I was always
reminded the line in 冯唐's book that reading book is like conversing
with the author, through time. 

And lot of times I felt that she was there, and she is there, though
far far far away, if not in front of my eyes, but in front of my
mind, my heart. There is such a thing as soul mate, I believe, and she
is mine.
