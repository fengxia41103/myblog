Maybe because it's too early, it took me a while just a moment ago to
remember where we went yesterday! Yea, Yokohama, a place I read so
much about in books, but never thought I would visit it one day. I had
no idea where it is until I looked it up last night, and wow, it's
only 30 minutes train ride from where we are.

Yokohama is pretty, really, and the building of Kanagawa University we
walked in was super pretty. If one ever wants to see an upscale
version of Boston, or any ocean harbor city, come here. And, if you
like to watch ladies in suits, well, I guess any train station in
Japan will be fine, but here you get the streamline version because of
the big glass buildings and finance district, smells money, smells
upscale, smells neat, clean, perfection, for their product, their men
and women. Incredible. Maybe I'm a bit obesessed, but they are simply
pleasant to look at. I can't help having a feeling that beauty in this
society is too much of a consumable goods, that one, for being pretty
and eye catching, is taken into this giant machine that will feed on
it till the beauty is there no more. Some lucky ones find a good place
in life so the styles could be maintained (there are many elegant
mid-age that are truly memorizing), but the rest, youth is the one
powerful drug, or the magic wand, that you could get anything you
want, for a short while perhaps, then the body is being spitted out of
this giant machine, like a waste... but how sad that would be if it
were true. Yet, their beauty is so much like the cherries, indeed
beautiful, breath-taking, 浮世.

I thought the Gundam lab would be more impressive than that. The giant
robot was cool to look at, but expectation led Noah to comment that
"it was underwhelming". It's ok. Noah found his interest satisfied
when we hit the rows of those "egg machines" &mdash; like candy
machine, one puts some coins ($3 per pop), rotate a big dial till one
egg shape package drops down, inside you find this cute little lucky
charm. Noah spent a whole hour, and you could tell how excited this
kid was. It was fun, and I have to say these charms are incredibly,
cute. He snuggled a couple right into his backpack before showing me,
the sole sponsor of this project. I knew he was saving those for
himself. See, that's the small fun in a small life, no Gundam, no
saving this planet or mankind, thirty dollars, one hour of time, 9
eggs in the end (and I'm not sure that's the real number, I think
there are more), and he was happy.
