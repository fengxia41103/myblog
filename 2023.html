<p>Left the company last Friday. The end came rather quickly. It was
announced on Thursday's meeting, then got the call on Friday that the
last day was then. Couldn't really tell I felt. It was expected, and
the timing was rather strange because I was working with an agent on
my Chinese visa so that I could start arrange a trip back home to take
care of dad and mom. So rather feeling shocked or sad, it was a bit of
"now I could plan for the trip without obligation" then. It's ok. I
have seen plenty of such ups and downs, and going on this trip is the
most important thing on my list. Dad passed away last May, and I
haven't been able to get him to our family's resting place due to the
stupid pandemic policy China has been following until recent. What a
shame! So here we go. Now without the job to worry about, I could
really think about what kind of trip I would like to have, and maybe
this is a sign by fate, or by dad, that it's time to get mom's rest of
life settled so that she could be safe and sound. Strange, isn't it,
how life and timing work? I don't know. These days I constantly feel
like swimming in an ebbing wave, not much control at all, just being
pushed here and there, and trying hard to peddle, and sometimes
doesn't even know why I still keep head above the water. I already
lost a lot of sense of purpose and interest. Life is not only dull,
but grim. It has little color in it, being both in the photos I take,
and the reality I see. Future isn't better, either. I don't know. It's
a depressing feeling I can't shake off regardless how hard I try. It's
just, there.</p>
<p>Adding to this, is the news that Da mama passed away. Had a chat w/ Da
jia jia. It wasn't really sad, but it was still sad. She got to 101
years old, maybe that's good enough for anybody. Still, it's another
person that I am familiar with, gone, no more, and that acknowledgment
by itself is the root of sadness. Right before this whole Covid chaos
I got to visit her at her nursing home on my 2019 trip. Haven't seen
her for years, and have heard plenty of this legendary nursing place
which Dad had plenty compliments on. Then, I took a great picture of
her, sitting on her wheelchair, smiling, with wrinkled hand, and still
wears her ring. She was cheerful as ever, though she had lost most of
her memories also just like Dad. She could hardly recognize who I am
after an introduction only a minute ago. But she was talkative, and
had a quick wit as she has always had. Dad at the time wasn't doing
well already. So watching her makes me wonder how a person farewell in
a life &mdash; she had plenty hardships in her life, and she kept her
head high; Dad had his share of pain and stress, and he did
alright. Then he quickened the pace and overtook her in this aging
process, and went ahead though he is 15/6 years younger than she
was. How strange life's plan really is! What's the purpose, or the
reason behind all these? What determines a person's time when his/her
time is up? ... in the end, both could now be counted as part of the
Covid statistics, and I bet neither of them had any such plan in
life. What a joke! Dad would have scorned on such idea, and she,
probably would have made some fun of this as her humor always did. But
in a sense they are now meeting again, on the same page, at the same
line, and in the same world.</p>
<p>Farewell, Da mama, and dad. I hope they all like the place there. Now
you could talk to each other again in your Shanghai dialects, and find
each other's thoughts comforting and calming. I will miss you, Da
mama, and I think I already do. Go cheer my dad, and make him laugh
again. Tell him I miss him very very much. If only I could know that
you guys are all doing well and happy there.</p></p>
