Enough talks of (big) data analysis, really!

This morning it suddenly occurred to  me, why I got so frustrated with
all  the talks  about data  analysis, like  the recent  news of  these
Chinese unicorn  company. All  the supporters  are quoting  that these
companies are worth that much because,  well, they have a lot of data,
therefore, data = gold, and there you go.

BS!

Finally  I  realized where  they  are  wrong  &rarr; instead  of  data
analysis,  they are  actually thinking  **I have  a lot  of digits**!!
Yes, they are equating numbers with _data_. Just because I have a load
of digits, meaning really nothing but, just a pile of digits.

What is  data? Even  by looking the  Chinese translation,  数据 (data)
vs. 数字(digit),  I think you already  know what I'm saying.   The key
element is  the 据, which is  the domain knowledge of  your digits. 1s
and 0s mean nothing unless you, the owner of this data, know what they
are about, what they should contain, and what they are used for.

You know, one clue to know that these talk show guests know nothing
about data analysis is that they never mentioned:

1. normalization: I have yet to come by any data that does not require
   some level of normalization. Period. Data have to be **unified** to
   a certain  common way  &mdash; normalization, so  that they  can be
   used to compare apple to apple. Take any data in your mind, if it's
   a percentage,  you will have  answer what  does 100% stand  for? if
   it's just  a number you have  to ask when  I see two of  them, 1000
   vs. 10, can I draw a  conclusion that 1000 is **better/worse** than
   the 10? Of  course not! You will  be utterly insane to  draw such a
   statement by just  looking at these two, digits!  Because, they are
   only comparable,  thus meaningful,  when they  are computed  in the
   same context (aka. domain).

   So the bottom line is, normalization is highly domain specific, and
   can be really really tough!! For  example, when you get two sets of
   data,  one  says  "Bob  whatever"   and  the  other  says  "William
   whatever", are these two the  same person!? and what reference/clue
   can you use to determine a yes or no? and how surely your reference
   is  correct!? same  phone number?  this is  likely; same  zip code?
   unlikely? same high  school graduated in 1964!?  very likely... you
   see, the  degree of reliability of  your reference is quite  an art
   also!

2. acquisition:  No one, just  no one,  has even mentioned,  how their
   data is acquired, and how do  you know these data are **accurate**?
   Forget about being  correct, since that's another  messy topic that
   is highly opinion-driven.

   Case  in   point,  those   bogus  movie   viewer  data,   or  their
   revenue.  Unless you  can explain  the method  you used  to acquire
   these data, they are simply not trustworthy, or I would simply say,
   completly meaningless, garbage!

    > Mentioning data analysis without showing how data is generated and
    > acquired, is a total crime!

3. well, then there are the topics of how overlapping they are ()

If you don't understand what I'm talking about, I can be sure that
you know nothing about data, or data analysis. So you can stop
reading now, and stop talking about data, pls!
