<h2>Introduction</h2>

<p>
Welcome to PY Consulting, a software development firm
who aims to lower the barrier for entrepreneurs
to enter the web application and mobile application arena.
</p>

<p>
We specialize in building and delivering
prototypes using robust system architecture and proven
technology. We believe many critical details and questions
can only surface through trying. Getting a prototype is not
an easy task, but a working POC is worth
a thousand (and feel free to multiply a few 10s to it) words,
because nothing
is more convincing than <strong>seeing an idea in action</strong>.
</p>

<p>
These articles are contributed by our staffs, and more interestingly,
some by our clients. Not only we have worked together
on projects with success (and we have buried
those failed ones and their owners in... no, we are not gonna tell you.),
but hearing what they say about their
industry and business, things that troubled them, and how we have
approached with a solution, shed lights on how similar techniques can
help you to find a way going forward.
