<p>I'm convinced now that the number one problem I am annoyed by the
modern Chinese culture is that it create self-contradictory
person. They speak in logics however they see fit without being aware
of that two points coming out of their mouth are actually
contradictory. Take it further, they took a one-sided view of history
in such a self-confidence that they completly fail to realize that what
they are bragging and broadcasting are exactly the same thing in
history they vow to be a terrible deed by any measure.</p>
<h1>Trade</h1>
<p>A case in point is the popular place such as the <a href="http://www.baike.com/wiki/%E5%A5%B6%E5%A5%B6%E5%BA%99">奶奶庙</a>. I think
the debate of it in the context of pop art or even pioneer art is
completly a walk-around. Can people idol these objects? of
course. Can they bring peace and love? Doesn't matter, and to some,
yes, so be it. Are they arts? Yes. Are they art I like? No. Should I
respect its right to be there? Yes, as long as I don't go there, and
it doesn't come close me.</p>
<p>So what is my point!? If you ask any Chinese about the dark age in Europe,
黑暗的中世纪, the years when China was supposed to be glorious and
prosperous and everywhere else is just, dark, they will all agree on
one well-known example that church was selling coupon to save people's
soul, for a monetary price. It's an example how ridiculous the western
religion had become, and how shameless and greedy these religious man
had become. Shame on them! But you know what!? Visitors of the 奶奶庙
are exactly doing that &mdash; trade! I pay you some due, and you give
me luck in turn. This is exactly what the dark age priests were doing,
so we were told, and we are all disgusted by it. But we are doing it, 
everywhere!!!!</p>
<p>And let's be clear of one thing &mdash; this is not religion. Religion
has fear; here has none.  It is an outcry to put this in the setting
of a religion, while you trade for personal benefits and leave out
guilt all at the same place, at the same time. This is exactly how
Chinese are operating today &mdash; dressing up as if it is a noble
deed in which you believe, you respect and you fear, but the truth is
they just want both sides of a coin, a mission impossible, as the
deal.</p>
<h1>Slave</h1>
<p>If we take this even further, it's quite entertaining.  If that traffic
Godness casts you a good luck, who is to make up the accident
statistics? If EVERYONE is now praying for the same Godness, does it
just eliminate accidents entirely!? What if two pray to two different
Gods, since we are geographically apart and my local people just made
up a new God who has the same purpose?  Woudln't then become a race
between the two Gods, that the stronger one will fulfill its
protection, while the other one fails? So we are back to the <strong>old
time</strong> when Gods are fighting, for us human, and we can only watch and
bear their outcome? If so, aren't we just paying them to do our fight?
Apparently so! This is a <span class="myhighlight">crowd
sourcing</span> boxing ring in which these made up Gods are going to compete
for their made up powers! How can then this be not comical!!!</p>
<p>Even more. These Gods are in a really sad position. Even if they had
the power as they say, they have no option to back out a deal. I can
pay the due when I feel so, and as soon as I pay it, the contract is
formed. The poor statue can't say no! So I could be a terrible bad
driver, and this traffic Godness is <strong>made</strong> to protect me (if she
wins the God-fighting ring) without an option.  I think we will all
agree that this is a terrible position to be in. Literally the Godness
loses control of her own work &mdash; this is like you work as a
slave, you do what is told &mdash; so who is the master now!?
haha.. this is really interesting!</p>
<p>Anyway. I just wanted to point out, how ridiculous the logic is that
this thing implies. It validates the feeling that when you look at it
or hearing about it, you feel that something is not right, and you
know that even the prayers are not really <em>believing</em> this &mdash;
it's a play in which they play a role. Prayers get a psyche boost, the
Godness gets nothing, and the operators get money. And who are these
operators? They are the slave owners in our era.</p></p>
