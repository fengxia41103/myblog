    <h1 class="myhighlight">Can you innovate?</h1>
  </div>

  <ol id="toc" class="row"></ol>

  <div>
    <div id="article-content">
      <p><p>This has been a topic on my mind for quite some time now ever since I
worked in Shanghai in 2016 and witnessed things that quite annoyed me,
especially from a software engineer prospective. </p>
<p>So the backdrop is that Chinese people have been encouraged by
the country's phenomenal success in economy and are now moving from <em>made in
china</em> to <em>created in china</em> &mdash; a sound idea, just like
<em>socialism</em> or any other idea someone around the corner has. The
idea is not the problem, the implementer is.</p>
<p>Ideas are cheap. There is a problem xyz, easy. The challenge is how we
are gonna find a solution for this problem, let alone a <em>satisfactory</em>
one? Well, no one can really define that. Even when you talk about a
<em>working</em> solution, the immediate argument will be what you mean by
<em>working</em>? How do you prove it works? This sounds more and more like
an attorney's job now, doesn't it? Well, let's leave this
philosophical dilemma and rant about why I was annoyed by this
innovation wave.</p>
<h1>Pls, stop "buzzing"</h1>
<figure class="col l6 m6 s12">
  <img src="images/funny/startup.jpg"/>
</figure>

<p>First, loading buzz words is not innovation.  These days just walking
into any coffee shop in Shanghai and locate any group of:</p>
<ol>
<li>more than 2 people (2 is more likely love birds chatting), </li>
<li>age band between 20-40</li>
<li>using laptop instead of smart phone or tablet</li>
<li>bonus: it's running a PPT</li>
<li>super bonus: it's running code</li>
</ol>
<p>Yes, you have just found <span class="myhighlight"> Latte
entrepreneurs</span>(love this name/<a href="https://www.peterjthomson.com/latte-entrepreneur/">ref</a>). Get a cup of coffee and
eavesdrop for a while, the buzz words are bound to flow in full
strength: <code>cloud computing</code>, <code>big data</code>, <code>sharing economy</code>, <code>amazon</code>,
<code>google</code>, <code>BAT</code>, <code>R</code>, <code>AI</code>...  Whatever the problem is, or even the
solution might be, these are the most common denominators.</p>
<p>I really shouldn't bash these ppl. After all they are thinking, and
trying to create a solution. But I was deeply annoyed because &mdash;
often than not they were using these words <span class="myhighlight">as
if they were a magic potion</span>! Just drink it and your problem is
solved. No! Their conversation barely scratched the surface of these
technologies (which I highly suspect it is because they don't
understand much of them, let alone first hand experience with them)
and rarely you hear a voice cautioning about implication, downside,
assumption and risk. But everybody knows that there is <span
class="myhighlight">free lunch</span>.</p>
<p>Let's say <em>cloud computing</em>. Why cloud? what make a cloud? Yes
there is the <a href="http://nvlpubs.nist.gov/nistpubs/Legacy/SP/nistspecialpublication800-145.pdf">NIST definition</a>, but that doesn't really mean
anything to me if you can't relate it to your own context (the problem
we are to solve) and explain (clearly):</p>
<ol>
<li>what will a cloud be used for</li>
<li>how it is going to help</li>
<li>which layer is going to help, and</li>
<li>how that decision was made</li>
</ol>
<p>To the minimum, if you are thinking that building a cloud is more of a
HW investment than SW, then you don't know what you are talking
about. If you are to rent from services like AWS, 
then can you tell me <span class="myhighlight">what challenge you 
are most likely to run into</span> (and I can tell you now it is
not just money... no, not data security, nor privacy, nor vendor lock
in... these are all valid points, but the real bummer, is the learning
curve). <span class="myhighlight">Yes, people, brain</span>.  That
will be the hardest asset to come by, and the most valuable in your
org. AWS is a wonderful service. It is a Ferrari with a million
dials. The magic word <em>cloud computing</em> is not going to just spit out
a solution for you. It will help, dramatically, if you know how to
tune those dials.</p>
<p>Man! I can't tell you how many times I had to battle
some Chinese IT fella in 2015 who wanted to sell his client
an Oracle database (the swiss army knife of DB) but
failed to come up a single example which feature of the Oracle is
needed in his application, and why alternatives are inferior? Come
on! if you are too lazy or just not good enough to set up an
apple-to-apple evaluation, then all what you are saying about the
wonderful things of Oracle, are just a word-of-mouth speculation.</p>
<h1>Domain silo</h1>
<p>The reason they took the buzz words as solution itself is that they
are taking an easy way out &mdash; a sounded cure-fore-all instead of
acquiring, analyzing and proving <strong>domain knowledge</strong>:</p>
<ol>
<li>How much do you really know the problem?  and the context of the
   problem?</li>
<li>What's the assumption you are taking to think of this as a problem?</li>
<li>What method you used to analyze the cause of this problem?</li>
<li>How do you support your argument? and how sound is your support,
   both qualitatively and quantitatively?</li>
</ol>
<p>My problem is that many conversations I have participated all went
with roughly 30-min of problem discussion then went right into
the grand future of the "what if we get 10% of the
13-billion population using this!?" How exciting! <span
class="myhighlight">Of course, even selling a million toilet paper is
an exciting business, and if you can figure out to sell them by the
piece instead of roll, man, you will be a legend for sure</span>.
This is not innovation talk; this is a group opium high.</p>
<p>Analyzing something is hard. As a matter of fact, any learning is
hard. To understand the problem is the hardest part, if not the only
thing it matters in an innovation. Most of us possess domain knowledge
of some sort. The quick measure I would suggest is how much time you
have spent in that domain. Time doesn't cheat, and practice does make
one perfect. So even with a domain expert onboard, the process of
knowledge sharing so the software guy can <span
class="myhighlight">internalize</span> the idea and in turn transform
it into his domain expertise, eg. a software model and code, and
transfer his thinking back to the team for verification and discussion
&mdash; this back-and-forth process not only takes time, but is a
steep learning on both sides. Most importantly, <span
class="myhighlight">it takes both sides' willingness to learn</span>
in order to work.</p>
<p>So for innovation, it's really a process of learning A LOT OF things
which you have little knowledge before, and each must contribute to
the pod with his/her sharing. Some of those will be easy to pick up;
others, will be frustratingly difficult. If it takes 3 years for a
highschool and a 4 years for a college, this <em>mega-million-dollar big
problem</em> you are trying to solve can't be easier than those.</p>
<p>Well, now look around, how many team members are excited about
learning some coding, or accounting?</p>
<h1>Stop IT me</h1>
<p>If there is one theme of the buzz word section, it is
the dominant relevancy of IT. Yes, software is everywhere; coding is a
must have. But then, how many times I saw the poor coder sitting on
the side the table, listening in silence, as if the idea flows one way
&mdash; from business owner to IT implementation.</p>
<p>In China, coders and their managers must have a love-hate
relatinoship. They are needed (somehow), but nobody wants to pay him
much. Even worse, nobody understands him. He lives without a style and
is bad at speech; his jokes are dry; his need is not much; his skill
is witch-like, from fixing an iPhone to writing an app, even sometimes
a WORD or PPT; and <span class="myhighlight"> the best of all, there
are a dime of dozen of them</span> in job market and by subway exit;
whatever their coding language is, they can all do the same thing, and
with the same quality, too &mdash; <strong>poor</strong>.</p>
<p>This is really bizzare. Writing software is hard; writing quality one
is really really really hard. By common sense you won't look at anyone
speaking English to be a novelist, let alone a Shakespeare. But that's
exactly the mentality these innovation teams or their investors
have. So with such thoughts, on the one hand coders are necessity but
certainly not a worthy <em>investment</em>, on the other hand coders lack proper
mentorship in work to learn, develop and mature, so their deliveries
proved the common bias &mdash; "Look, this is scrappy
produce/code... I'm totally overpaying you..." sad, sad, sad.</p>
<p>Chinese management and team setup are so used to the hierarchy they
grow up with in school, in their previous jobs, and in the society
overall, that this is the only format they know. But innovation, as we
have argued, is depending on knowledge sharing, cross training, and
mutual interest in each other's domain. Hierarchy not only makes
information flow in one direction only, but enforces domain silo and
ignorance which enpowers the seemingly superior position (mgt? founder? investor?)
to legitimize its ignorance &mdash; "Hey look, IT guy, I hired you
because I don't know IT...".</p>
<p>So how to fix this? Stop using the word "IT"! It's an enormous topic
under this umbrella that each consists of a technology that can be
extremely challenging. If you are an IT guy, do you know <code>database</code>?
how about <code>nosql</code>? and deployment? and performance tuning? clustering?
modeling?  driver?... and network? server? storage?
virtualization?... So to make things straight, <span
class="myhighlight">stop IT me</span>. Let IT's voice be part of the
contribution, not just a downstream magic pod that will turn idea into
reality. Let everyone be <span class="myhighlight">practical</span> 
and <span class="myhighlight">specific</span> in term of their domain &mdash; yes
I know something about Python and Django web framework; no, I don't
know much about database, networking and storage. Same goes for HR,
for business analyst, for product owner, for investor, and for everone
who takes innovation seriously. </p>
<h1>Disruptive, not</h1>
<figure class="col l6 m6 s12">
  <img src="images/funny/disruptive.jpg"/>
</figure>

<p>A byproduct of China's economy miracle is an impatience to realize a
dream. Even worse, urban legends encourage one to be <em>disruptive</em>,
because, just look around, how many new riches found their fortune by
disrupting the traditional course with their ignorance and ego alone!
The mentality of <em>nothing is impossible</em> is not a slogan, it's a
common sense.</p>
<p>But no, innovation is not, and can not be, disruptive. We have argued
innovation is rooted in domain knowledge, and that knowledge forms the
food chain we see today, which in turn brew the perceived problem. The
instinct of redrawing the map to remove that problem is absolutely
correct &mdash; it's like taking fish out of its tank. It will
die. But the new map will have its own quirks, just you haven't seen
them yet. <span class="myhighlight">So being disruptive in that sense
is nothing but replacing the old, visible problems with a promise
while repeating "no problem no problem no problem..." to your covered
ears</span>.</p>
<p>Innovation is not magic. It can only be a system with feedback loop
that can be continuously tuned. Like writing software, you always
started with a version 1, and ended up with version 989287429 after
that many iterations of trial-and-error. If you ignore (or downplay)
the intermediates, viola, your end result looks absolutely
<strong>innovative</strong>!  Think about Newton's apple, or Einstein's, or Google,
or Amazon, great arts, or any disruptive technology/solution you have
in mind, just look closer, read and research, you will find
breadcrumbs all over its path. The last push gets all the glory, but
the truth is that it's standing on the shoulder of a giant, and the
ladder to climb is the <span class="myhighlight">spirals of continuous try-measure-tune-repeat</span>.</p>
<h1>Innovating</h1>
<p>Yes I'm a tech guy and am on a <em>perpetual</em> learning curve of some new
or unfamiliar technologies. With a growing age, I found myself even
constantly on a review session of some old technologies &mdash; a
command line I can't think of anymore after a couple month, a Python
syntax that now eludes me and I have to google it &mdash; this is not
even stackoverflow because SO is used only when I can ask a (smart)
question that has passed Python 101. I'm talking about <em>google python
built-in function</em> type of basics. Shame. But there are just so many
pieces one needs to know in order to build a technology stack.  So to
me I'm constantly learning, constantly thinking, constantly
re-inventing wheels or copying someone else's wheels, and constantly
writing something <strong>new</strong> and <strong>fresh</strong> that only my brain is
producing.</p>
<p>Those last part, if being original and bearing a thought worth
talking about, is my solute to innovation.</p></p>
