Sitting at coffee shop and after a cup of coffee, my mind is always,
springing back to life ~~ 

So it suddenly occurred to me, what happened SARS? I read all these
optimistic beats in wechat, and got seriously worried about what
people are deriving by shallow observation and an implied impatience
to end this misery as soon as possible. Who doesn't!? But the
documentary watched w/ Noah the other day, [Virus Empire: From SARS to
Ebola], made me feel quite otherwise from these sentiments &mdash; the
Spanish Flu virus killed only 145 people in its first ran, but two
years later wiped 50 million &mdash; no kidding, no shit, no
mercy. Again, like engineering work I do, sentiment counts for nothing
in the face of detail, practicality, and reality &mdash; you can wish
however you want, the things will work when all gears match, or
collapse when a single screw is missing. That, is the life.

Googled SARS, the very first hit is by [WHO][2], of course, and I has
no reason to doubt its credibility. It has a ["Situation Updates -
SARS"][3] section listing its trackings in reverse chronicle order, and
interesting enough, the last line, [May 18, 2004][4] &larr; ah, talking
about going back in time, history, let's see.

Now, this news, is just, disturbing! WTF!

So SARS was, **speculated** to have come from the _National Institute
of Virology in Beijing_, and now we all know Wuhan happened to have a
Lvl 4 Bio lab, now the whole city is locked down, and the whole world
is, worked up... coincidence!?

I think, yes? no? yes? no?... 

Btw, I'm entirely not sure about the idea of **turning point (拐点)**
&mdash; I mean, is this even a legitimate concept in describing a
viral outbreak!? I seriously doubt it, because it's very easy to
perceive such a thing in a simple curve. But hey, let's look at a Sine
wave, and you tell me which is the turning point!? The whole
assumption of this term lies in that once it passes the peak, it will
start to steadily decrease and approximating zero in the long run
&mdash; but, isn't that a wishful thinking!? I don't think virus agree
w/ this at all, otherwise, by mathematics all viruses will be,
containable, because it is just a matter of how long this curve is
&mdash; HIV takes like years, flu, 7 days (so I'm operating when Noah
gets sick), and so on... But this is just pure naive. **Why not a curve
ever going up!? Why not a cyclical pattern like a Sine wave!? Why not
a flat line for ever and ever!?** What is the assumption to rule out
these patterns? and how these assumptions are proved!?

Again, this outbreak is a like an awesome reality show that everybody
is now involved, everybody has to act and react, and it's like how
human will show their true ingredients in front of a dire situation,
here we are, standing naked in front of virus, and each one acting in
a way to justify the situation and make peace w/ him/her-self. A
majority of the Chinese, from what I read and heard, are going through
a pretty clear struggle of "yes they should be shut in their houses,
otherwise they will be acting selfishly", to "I'm sacrificing my own
little convenience for a greater good", thus feeling elevated
self-pride, to "enough is enough, I'm done w/ my duty, and now let me
out and play, and if you stop me, eat my ass"... Fascinating, isn't
it?

I think shutting down the city was a sound decision. Creating panic by
not being transparent was a bad decision. Acting patriotically is
great on individual basis, but a terrible deed to be broadcasted and
even promoted on government's end. I'm glad that modern infrastructure
is able to support these many people being locked in a cage (actually,
to think about it, it's not much difference living in the city on a
common day vs. in lock down days &mdash; your radius of movement is
just those few blocks, and entertainments are all at your finger tips
as long as virus doesn't attack your router or your ISP). So the
perception of anxiety is really from self-pity, sympathy, and boredom
once it lasts for too long &mdash; the same logic when you wait in
line at bank for over 10 min, you grow impatience, and even angry, but
the reality is, that 10 min doesn't make a dime of difference for
99.99999% of the people (especially if you still need to go bank line
for their service ~~ if your time is that precious, trust me, bank
waits for you, not the other way around). It's just a psychological
thing.

Anyway. I feel sorry for people who are going through this. I
constantly think this is a man made, disaster, not that its origin is
man made (that is going to be a conspiracy theory for many years to
come), but the way we handle it, and the way we live through it
&mdash; like war, not that all die and no one lives through it &mdash;
millions did survive.

But, who wants to go back and relive those days, again!?
