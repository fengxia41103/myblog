Finished reading Kenneth Clark's [Civilisation][1]. I can't say I
actually understand the book, because nearly every item he was talking
about and describing with passion and logic, I had little idea. I
barely recognized some names, and very little of the
artifacts. Sculptures, some; paintings, nearly none; background
history and social context, zero. Even the wordings he used were
elusive to me, because it felt _discrete_ in a sense of continuity of
meaning &mdash; I could recognize most of the words, then never saw
the pattern that this word is connected with that word in a sentence,
and had no idea what this combination means!

# Art?

Alas! This is terrible. Here I am, reading a classic on
**civilisation**, yet I do not understand a thing! On the back of my
mind I was thinking, isn't this the same feeling of ignorance and
disconnect when foreigner looks at Chinese arts? and what about the
most recent news of [奶奶庙][2], that people are debating whether
these local artifacts are a form of popular art, or an example of poor
taste. So when it is an eye sore, to me, isn't it because I lack of
the context, thus, like looking at these truly marvelous of the West,
so as to being clueless of how to appreciate? Isn't _beauty_, after
all, a complete subjective matter? But if so, how do we perceive
beauty? how do we create a _beautiful_ thing, a _beautiful_ feeling, 
a _beautiful_ act, anymore, if it is just your words against mine?
Doesn't this feel, wrong?

Interesting. I do not know. I don't think there is a qualified
_beauty_, that someone can define, or determine, or discriminate one
form or another. Yet, there is a sense of beauty in us. You can't deny
it. There is a common beauty. There is a timelessness in them. I can't
explain, nor even give example. But it's
there. The [La Marseillaise][3] moves me everytime it is played. It's
a sensation shooting through my vein.  You want to stand up, you want
to march, you want to fight for a principle, and you can die for it.

Music, painting, sculpture, literature... arts have such a power that
they can possess the receiver at the moment of engagement. How
transforming! So what about these [奶奶庙][2] arts? Aren't they on the
equal footing as those classics since they also bring a sensation to
their audience, just on a different spectrum than mine?

# No

But no. I still have to disagree. As liberal as I try, these _objects_
are vulgar. Same apply to many of the modern Chinese sculptures,
statues, and buildings. To think of it, it is not these big **mass**
themselves are at fault. No. There are some that are just replica of
the originals, like the [Charging Bull][4], while others are free
range vulgarity some called _creativity_. Even when it is a truthful
copy, it looks bad. The _creative_ ones are, just alien.

Why so? I think they lost the soul, the **genuity**, the spirit
within, the life, and thus become a superficial, lifeless, 
thus become a joke. The great sculptures
convey such a force, be it a smooth marble of a human head, or a
charging bull in bronze, it talks to you without holding back an inch
of the feelings that author felt and invested into it. No holding
back. It's not only all there, it wants more, it creates more, it
empowers you. Beethoven, Mozart, [La bohème][5], love letter, a great
movie, a portrait... it beholds you, it has its own identity, speaking
to you, staring at you, and disrupting you. It's a language by its own
that best describes the scene and conveys an emotion, and it does it
**perfectly**. It has motion,
has a thought, has a moment, that draws you into it, so you can be
part of what it is presenting.

Those Chinese mockups, lost all of the above. You know what, this
actually is familiar &mdash; they took the shell, thinking the shell
is the whole. So there is a perfect replica in form, but has no root
&mdash; a charging bull by the entrance of a condo community, a
Capitol Hill  shaped county government building, or even the super
ugly [egg][6]. I think they are all looking great, marvelous
creation; but they don't fit where they are because they have no soul.
What to fight and charge when it sits next to a bunch of cookie cutter
high-rise condos!!!????? And how it be **restless** and **resisting**
when the whole point of residential is about peaceful family life!???
Isn't this a joke or what!? And the performance arts in a round,
smooth, harmony looking egg!? NO! Performance arts are energy,
initiation, burst of force, searching deep in human soul, touching the
untouchable, speaking the unspeakables! How can they live with
harmony!!?... I'm angry, I'm about to cry, because they are sooooo
fake and soo lost the meaning of what the form is for... these, are
genuine insult on arts.

Diversity creates beauty (how interesting the
[fearless girl][7] is!). But fake shells can never.
