<p>Though it is a Friday, actually just another Friday in life, in 2019,
weather is nice, went to the gym, didn't have much sleep last night
since Noah and I had a rough night, but my body felt fine, not
tired.. but for some strange reason, my mind, is very disturbed.</p>
<p>I sense this strange timing this morning, that wherever I went, I ran
into some good looking girl or woman, and happened to be, that we will
across each other walking towards the same direction, but w/ them
always just a few steps behind me... to me, it is just a very strange
feeling that someone walk behind me like that, as if I were being
observed. I kept telling myself, don't be such a self-centered person,
who really cares about you anyway? Yet, it's just part of me since I
was little, that I constantly sense, or imagine, that their attention
was on me... well, what else to look at anyway, when there is just
someone walking in front of you, and not like walking on the 5th
Avenue that you get a lot to check out. Here we are, walking towards
office from parking lot, or from bld 7 to bld 8 crossing the 奈何桥,
no one but the two of us... it was just, uneasy.</p>
<p>Very often, first thing in the morning, you will start to notice a
pattern for the day, keeps happening wherever you go, whatever you
do. On some days the pattern is good, so you would have a good day;
then on others, man, just embrace yourself, and survive.</p>
<p>Why so!? I'm not a fatalist at all. But why so, why this pattern, why
can I sense it while it seems that others simply don't notice them at
all? Are they really just a reflection of your mind on that day, that
when you were happy or in a good mood, the sky would be blue
regardless what the weather really was!? or, they are indeed external
to me, existing independently. Though my mood would influence my
perception of the blue sky, it can only tint it, not change it? or can
it change it altogether?</p>
<p>I don't know. But this morning I have this strange feeling that
something is off. Noah is really struggling w/ his homework &mdash;
the kid spent 2 hours working on one single math problem out of a
lesson's practice, which has 7 problems on a double side A4! &larr;
and he didn't even get that problem right! wt heck!.... then, he
didn't get to bed till 1 o'clock in the morning!!!!.... isn't this
crazy or what!... what's up w/ him? I tried all kinds of persuasion,
father-and-son chat, punishment, encouragement, even played checker
last night after dinner just to <em>relax the mood</em> and give the kid a
break... none worked. Disappointing, indeed. I don't know what else I
could help this kid to understand that study is like his swim
training, is like the theme of the hare &amp; tortoise story &rarr;
perseverance. He might have been born w/ a brain of a hare. But his
race against his peers have just been another hare's race, also
&mdash; he got distracted left and right, and he is not far behind all
the tortoises. I hate how Chinese parents use the analogy of a race to
describe how kids are competing each other even when they were first
born, so called 输在起跑线上, I thought that's completely BS, and I
had felt lucky for Noah that I could give him an environment in which
he would not be put in such a position to endure such nonsense. Oh
well, so I have failed miserably. Not only he didn't appreciate the
privilege, but he failed to take advantage of the head start, and
refuses to grow up. I can't say it is very disappointing, because I
have to remind myself that it is unfair to him to impose my
expectation upon him. But I have to say, he is letting me down, he is
letting himself down. I really don't care whether he wins the <em>race</em>
at all, because I really don't care how all the other kids are doing
comparing to him. Yet, he is not doing well. Not at all. He is
becoming a worse person than before, and I don't know how to stop him
from becoming so.</p>
<p>Maybe the truth of my uneasy mind this morning, is that, I'm
disappointed of myself. Not only I have lost the battle of marriage,
of happiness, but now have lost the battle of parenthood, of making a
happy kid and a smart son. So that's what really is, a LOSER, written in
capital, indeed.</p></p>
