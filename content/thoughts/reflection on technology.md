Slug: reflection on technology
Author: Feng Xia


[This][1], is an excellent topic, excellent!! I love it. 

We need reflection of technology, of the terms tech talks use to
promote themselves and to dwarf others. I have argued before that the
so called 弯道超车 is ridiculous and outright disgusting. Period. This
implies to take a shortcut to win the race. I understand perfectly
technology and new way of doing things can, and should be, if they are
actually good, disruptive. But like everything else in life, the
majority of all are just mediocre, and even trying-too-hard. The true
good ones are always, I believe, always, organic &mdash; meaning that
the idea comes from rich experience and deep insights, not some
outsider dreams of a new way overnight. My favourate these days is the
news of `vpnhub` owned by `porthub` &larr; what a wonderful genius
idea!!!


Technology is good, is wonderful, and is hard. I have stated in [what
does IT system bring][2] that there are three, and only three benefits
a technology is going to, and should, produce &mdash; information
transparency, efficiency, and accountability. The article made a very
good point that:

> The word “innovation” has become synonymous with Silicon Valley to
> the point of absurdity. Indeed, the tech industry's entrepreneurs
> and "thoughtfluencers" throw it around as casually as a dodgeball in
> a middle-school P.E. class; what it really means is perpetually
> unclear and purposefully hazy. It is vague enough to be suitable in
> nearly any situation where a new product, service or "thing" is
> advertised as superior to the old — never mind if the so-called
> "old" thing has some distinct advantages, or if the new thing's
> superiority is solely that it makes more money than the old thing,
> or if there are other old things that are actually superior yet
> which won't make anyone rich. (Consider Apple removing the headphone
> jack from its new phones to be Exhibit A.)
> 

Like other buzz words, the word `technology`, `innovation`, are
becoming a cliche, and are being used freely without clarification nor
accountability. Technical solution, especially in the sense of
everybody's life, is becoming the **new middle man** that take a share
of the transaction, but downplaying any human element left.

It is very concerning that everyone is hailing for [Facebook's][3]
downturn, or even its success, because what I'm witnessing the impact
on social interaction is darn disturbing &mdash; I can not, and refuse
to budge, that two young couple sitting at a breakfast in Shanghai
will each read their smartphone, but not talking, not holding hands,
not making eye contact, and not being social! This, is **ridiculous**!

The only argument to defend this is always convenience. But then,
convenience isn't the crown jewel of humanity, isn't the goal of life,
isn't even necessarily a good thing. I like convenience, but it will
never dictate my choice of life, because, after all, there is still,
responsibility, duty, integrity.

Do something truly smart, is good, admirable. But in too many
occisions, I only saw pretended smartness, which, I have a word,
**pretentious**.
