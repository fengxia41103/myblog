Dana called yesterday. Her older brother Michael, died. Had an uneasy
sleep last night. Went and got a beautiful bouquet, a card, and wrote
a letter. Too many memories coming back to me, reminds me
of 2006. It's hard. Such a thing, is always, hard. There isn't easy
way out. There isn't even a way out. It's a dead end, sad, dark,
lifeless. Stopped by Amy's house, Alan walked to the door, eyes are
red. I didn't know what to say, or what else to say. I couldn't
speak. It's hard for parents to lose a child, especially when they
themselves are old. I can't imagine how I can cope with such an even
if it happened to Noah later in life. I would probably survive, but
only half of myself will be left, if half can be left.

The pic I saw on the China trip kept popping up in my mind &mdash; the
彝族 father saying farewell to probably his son at a funeral. Sadness
has no boundary, even if it were of a stranger. I could feel the
emotion, the pain, the hopeless cry, the light going out. Life is
fragile, when you see thing like this, happen in front your eyes, even
it is just a piece of paper, a printed photo! It doesn't retain
happiness for long, that how soon we just forgot the happy moment of
last night, last week, last lover. Yet, sadness, is like a dead
weight, doesn't fade, doesn't disappear, it lingers on and on,
consumes anyone coming across its path.

Can one be heartless? and will it be, easier? I don't know. It's just
difficult, the life itself, is difficult. I used to be full of
optimism, thinking I could manage, come out of, keep head above water,
and so on... now, it doesn't look promising at all. Life is so long
that it is scary. We don't know what cards God has for us. But I start
to wonder that all hands dealt are just as bad &mdash; one is born
with a full body, full heart, a clean soul. Then, like wind chipping
away a rock, little by little, it looks nothing like its origin
anymore, potholes all over, wierd shape and angle and slice and dice,
ugly, rough, part of it crumbles... that, is the fate of, everybody. 

How sad.
