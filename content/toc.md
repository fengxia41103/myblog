We have done these prototypes
    in 2015. All were proposed by an entrepreneur
    who has spotted an opportunity which s/he
    was hoping to pursue. Putting the ideas aside,
    they were all facing the same challenge of themselves not
    being technology savvy and hardly knew where to start.
    We took on the task to build a prototype, usually
    within 1-2 weeks after our first meeting. With a POC
    gradually forming, discussions became more and more
    productive and detail driven, thus allowing
    a formerly intimidating problem to be divided into
    smaller manageable pieces.
