</figure>

<p>Bumped into an article by the Google news directory, <a href="https://www.statnews.com/2020/03/17/a-fiasco-in-the-making-as-the-coronavirus-pandemic-takes-hold-we-are-making-decisions-without-reliable-data/">"A fiasco in the
making? As the coronavirus pandemic takes hold, we are making
decisions without reliable data"</a>, and its
follow up discussion that <a href="https://www.statnews.com/2020/04/27/hear-scientists-different-views-covid-19-dont-attack-them/">"Scientists who express different views on
Covid-19 should be heard, not demonized"</a>. I find them very
interesting because a recent event between me and Noah had echoed a
similar dilemma &mdash; can we know ahead of time? or in other words,
are we constantly putting a cart in front of a horse?</p>
<p>Both questions sound pretty, stupid. Any common sense would say <strong>NO</strong>
to both &mdash; no we can't know ahead of time (as we often heard <em>no
one has a crystal ball</em>), and certainly it's a bad sign if the cart is
put in front the horse (as my current project is perceived to
be). But, if the answers are so obvious, why do they even pop up, all
the time, and worthwhile to discuss? Let me first start the even w/
Noah.</p>
<p>Like many other days I prepared a meal for him, and towards the end of
it he said he was full and couldn't eat anymore (and we are usually
talking about a tiny portion that was left on the plate, and this
totally reminds me myself at his age that I was doing the same thing,
and my brother got really mad one day, and I thought "what a nasty guy
(to point this out blankly)!", oh well, what goes around, comes
around, don't they!?) So <em>naturally</em> I started my lecture that "you
could have said at the beginning that I couldn't finish them, and thus
cut out the portion you would finish, instead of touching food like
this towards the end. Now what are we gonna do w/ this left overs!?"
Well, whiling saying that, I was thinking loud to myself, how could
he, or anyone in that matter, know beforehand that he couldn't finish
the portion!? What about the saying that <em>never try, never know</em>!?
Wouldn't it be reasonable, or inevitable, that he could only find out
that he can't finish this much once he is towards the end of it? The
definition that "I can't eat anymore" is that when I get to the point
when there is food left, isn't it? So, it's simply not fair of my
lecture.</p>
<p>But then, is this a mistake doing the lecture? If the statement "I
can't know before it happened" becomes stand, wouldn't he then get
away from anything? Seems so, doesn't it? Like his accidents, his
mischiefs, since they are all measured by their consequences, and
consequences are carts, that can only seen towards the end, thus he
legitimately can create such left overs again and again because, he
couldn't possibly know his capacity until he tries it. Doesn't sound
right either. So what am I missing?</p>
<p>Same for these two articles &mdash; enough data and evidence will take
time to be accumulated, analyzed, and even then, there is not
guarantee that only one view (or _the view) will emerge, left alone
being agreed upon. So, can we have all waited till then to take an
action, such as this staying-at-home order, even though we don't know
either whether this is doing more harm than good? I don't know. I echo
the author's argument, but in the middle of this event, I also don't
see an alternative if I were the governor &mdash; people (yeah, I'm
using this word which I dislike) demand an action, any action. This
leads me to believe the true question lies in human psych, and in this
case, the social psych &mdash; </p>
<ol>
<li>why do people want an action asap?</li>
<li>Isn't it a soothing factor that is more important than its actual
   result?</li>
<li>Wouldn't this soothing effect itself be sufficient to justify the
   action?</li>
<li>Does it matter that we will <em>deal with the results</em> later, but take
   the action now? Especially that no one can tell the result anyway,
   right (not enough evidence for or against!), so isn't taking an
   action better than being a sitting duck?</li>
<li>Even after some time we have evidences, wouldn't it be interpreted
   subjectively anyway, that some thinks it justifies the past action,
   while others disagree (but even so, so what!? We can't go back in
   time, and damage is done, right?)</li>
</ol>
<p>Puzzling, isn't it? So it seems to me, one way or another is equally
valid, or equally baseless. <strong>In this sense the action guy will always
win, even by the fact that collecting evidence takes time, while the
power to ac is available, now!</strong> Thus, I believe this pattern will
always be so, regardless what the even will be in the future. I
totally agree that letting these voices heard is critical for social
health. But I'm convinced that these voices will always not be in the
driver's seat, thus making no material difference for the ongoing
event &larr; well, if so, it makes them heard even more appealing
since, they don't do any <em>harm</em> :)</p>
<p>What a convoluted world human has got themselves in!</p></p>
