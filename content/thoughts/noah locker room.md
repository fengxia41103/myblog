Hi Noah,

This locker room incident has been on my mind for the last two days. I
don't know what to say, yet I feel I have so much I want to say, ask,
and converse. I called Sharon looking for advice, and she suggested to
write you a letter. I thought it is a good idea. Words are easy to
make, but also easy to forget. By writing them down I would have to
organize my thoughts better, and examine again how the words would
convey. Hopefully this is a better format for us to exchange our
feelings, because I believe we both have a lot on the mind, but
equally poor at expressing them well. So let's try this.

I heard from mom that you are regretting what happened. I am glad to
know that, but deep inside I feel very sad. Both as a parent and as an
adult, I feel we have let you down. I wish we had known earlier of
what was going on between you and other kids. Foremost I wish we had
been there to offer a better solution than this one before you drew
the conclusion this is the best option. But we weren't able to help
then. You were hurt, and now we feel the pain also.

I feel sad you went through this alone. I feel sad to see you in a
situation where you don't feel safe. I feel sad none of us was able to
be that person you are willing to go to when you were
stressed. Looking back on the days we were together, I feel I lost you
somewhere along the way. I don't know where, and I don't know
how. It's a sense of failure. But more importantly, it's the sense of
powerlessness, that we didn't know what to do when you, someone we
care and love deeply, needed help. Watching you slipping down a
slope is the most painful experience I could imagine, and it hurts
badly.

I know your mom for 16 years now. I don't recall seeing her in such an
emotional distress before. She is a strong woman, but she is not a
superwoman. Labor of work, our cats, taking care of your daily need,
our Airbnb, she is trying to keep all these balls in the air. It's not
easy.

Over these 16 years, I also don't recall seeing her as happy as when
you were admitted into the YOTA that night. If feeling proud of one's
child is common for all parents, then hers towards you is on a higher
level than many others. If you recall, it was also her who registered
you to these trials over the last three years, and nudged me to take
you there when I was hesitant. If there were one person on this world
who is wholeheartedly cheering for your swimming progress, it is
her. Seeing you losing the seat on YOTA is a devastating blow. I could
only imagine how hard this is on her.

When I went through my photos, I often saw pictures of you since
little. I can't help thinking how much future was lying in front of
this young boy then, and how we have been proud you for all the little
steps you have made. Over this journey, you have fallen miserably in
the past -- bruises, scars, maddening moments, you name it. Yet, you
grew, grew, became stronger and stronger each year. I recall the days
when we could list the first 10 words you knew and the exact next word
coming up to your vocabulary. Now I wouldn't dare to challenge your
knowledge in science, biology, and certainly no match in those games,
youtubes, and God knows what other things your brain has acquired. You
have learned so much, and we love seeing it! One day you would also be
a parent, having your child. Maybe then you would understand how much
we are proud of you and all these, and how much seeing you fall like
hurts.

Remember I said that this is our first time being a parent? Each
passing day, each challenge you faced, was also a new one to us. It's
not easy to drive to YMCA each day considering million other things
have to be taken care of. But both of us enjoyed it, because your
training and your achievement gave the time the best meaning we could
wish for. My best reward was always the trip back after your training.
Seeing you in a good spirit warms my heart. When we learned you have
made new friends on the team, we felt so much relieved because we
worried about this after the school suspension. In my opinion, having
mutual support is the best part of a sports team. Everytime when you
walked out the training with other kids smiling and chatting, I felt
as happy and cheerful as you were. When you went to your coach after
each event during the meet to clasp hand with her and hang out for a
chat, I felt we have found you a group that would take care of you
well and you would be thriving in it.

So, picturing all these thrown away is extremely difficult for us at
the moment. Even though we are adults, we don't know what to do
now. We feel the pain, both of yours and of ourselves', but we don't
have a magic pill. You have read coach's email. I think they are
sincere, honest, and will handle this well. I trust in their
experience and judgment. So whatever the consequence they decide, I
would respect.

I also think we the family owe an apology to both the team and kids
involved. For the one you offended, we owe an apology for the
act. Violence is never a good idea. It will only create more
violence. For the other two boys in the locker room, we owe an apology
for having them witnessed such a violence. They were forced into this
situation without a choice. And for your coach and team, we owe an
apology for putting them through this disruption. Mom and I will reach
out to coach for a meeting including you. I think we should do this
face to face. Personally I feel ashamed in front of them. Let's try to
fix this as much as we can as a family together. It's never too late
to recognize our own fault, admit it, and give it a try of fix.

I also encourage you to reach out to your coach and maybe other
kids. They shared the same feeling we have, that we feel sad seeing
you did that, and worried about your well being. If you had something
to say to them, tell them. Maybe like what I'm doing now, put your
thoughts in a letter. You may think that "they must hate me
now". Trust me, they don't hate you. Nobody hates someone who is
sincere and honest even if he had just made a mess. They are probably
as shocked and confused as we are.

Ok. Thanks for reading this. I just want you to know our feelings, and
find a way to communicate. I still wish mom and I could be the go-to
person for you when you are in distress. Nothing is worse for us than
seeing you Noah suffers. I hope you will understand this now and put
trust in us next time.

Love,
feng
