Add my thoughts on how to remodel 517. I have some ideas. Most surely,
I want a big bookshelf as my Boston home, and I'm going to remove
kitchen wall cabinets to make them shelves also. I like open
spaces. Besides, I don't see point to put all the junks into cabinets
and drawers in order to hide them &mdash; they will live there
forever, and I don't like this idea. I would rather them to be in the
open, if they are useful to me, so I will use them frequently, and for
things I don't use much, well, better not to have a space for them to
begin with. Don't you think so? So I think open shelves will make this
hiding activity less pleasant because I'll be looking at them and
become annoyed by them, so that will curb me buying them at the first
place. Good deal.

# my book shelf

This is 2nd version of it after a few email threads w/ Rakks. It's
coming together :)

After initial contact, they modified it and sent me this. Notice that
spacing is changed to `33"`, which makes one pole really close to the
drop down ceiling beam. This also presumes two ends will be shorter
&mdash; mine was `16"` while theirs assumes `6"` on both ends. I think
theirs will look prettier. Since the poles are not bolted to wall
anyway, I can always arrange them differently at installation. So we
will see.

# kitchen shelf

Don't like wall cabinets &mdash; they are boxes on wall and so high
that they look, chunky! I don't like them a bit. Besides, top shelf
will be so high that it's not functional at all. So the entire idea of
having these cabinets so you have _plenty storage_ is just bogus to
me &larr; I want something that is functional, useful to my daily
routine, and leave the space if I can't fill them up! Yes, I may put a
few picture frames there to make my eyes happy, why staring at those
boring boxes!
