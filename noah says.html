    <h1 class="myhighlight">Noah says</h1>
  </div>

  <ol id="toc" class="row"></ol>

  <div>
    <div id="article-content">
      <p><p>This is to keep track what Noah says these days, some smart
remarks. But first of all, let me vent what this kid is like, this
morning, that was totally pissing me off!! &mdash; so I was cleaning
his glasses the last minute before leaving for school bus. There is
this missing piece off one of the legs, looked like the plastic has
been burned off by fire. So I asked what happened to it, he replied:</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>"I chewed it off." "But why!?" "<strong>I had this sudden desire to chew
   it.</strong>" Said calmly and unshamefully. WTF!</p>
<p>So here goes the first line of his I'm writing down. So him.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Commenting on the new badminton coach he had in class. "This guy is
   all about power." "Oh so he was a power player. That's good."  "Not
   really. <strong>Sometimes power has to bow to wisdom.</strong>" &mdash; very
   philosophical, isn't it!?</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>8:30 pm. Out of nowhere, after his Mom left for gym, he said to me,
   "爸，我决定了，等你有了517, 我和你住" "Why?" "Because I think it
   will be difficult living with her." "Why?" "So she bought snack
   without looking at the label, and it turned out to be wasabi
   flavored, and I was the first one eating it, and I didn't have
   water then..."  hahaha!! Poor little guy!! But I asked him whether
   he has other reasons for this decision, and he said, "第二， she
   gets up late, so there is increasing chance I'll be late for
   schoolbus."  "Anything else?" "Yes. I'm actually feeling scared by
   myself at home, though everytime I said I will be ok." "You mean
   when she goes to gym and leaves you at home?" "Yes" "Then tell her
   so next time." "ok" "I leave you for gym when you come with me in
   the office also." "But that's daytime."..... "Of course. You can
   come live with me anytime. I'll get you a key... wait, I'll
   introduce you to the concierge, so she will know you, and you can
   just come whenever you want."</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>10:00 pm. Math, struggling w/ the concept of "20% off", which he
   subtracted <code>$0.2</code>. Why so? "So how much is 20%?" "It's 20 over 100"
   "So how much will that be?" "0.2, 20 cents". Speechless, isn't it!</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>"Noah, remember to think before you ask." Pretty common
   conversation between. I don't recall what the topic
   was. Anyway. Listen to this. "爸， 我在新加坡的时候就有think." Very
   firm tone. "Really!? How?" "你记得吗？那个时候我想要touch一个bird
   poop" "我不记得了...然后呢？" "然后你说了No" "Yeah, that sounds
   right!" "但是那个时候我就有think" "How!?" this is interesting "真的
   真的！那个时候我就在think, 那个bird poop看起来是dry, 所以我就很想要
   touch它"...... speechless, isn't it!? What an example he gave to
   testify that he actually, thinks ~~</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Noah figured out how to put his math answer back into the equation
   to verify, "哇塞，我做的这么对！！" He was genuinely surprised by
   himself, haha, what a fun to watch him grow in moment like this.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>A beautiful early summer evening. After a long stressful day
   evacuating the contractor and his tools, having a barbecue w/ Noah
   outside the kitchen. He was talking w/ his mom about virus
   vs. bacteria. Mom was asking about "do you know which virus, and
   the only virus, cured by human so far?" (it was Hypatitis-C). Noah
   studied his science vigilantly in the week and the topic was about
   virus &amp; bacteria, so he was confident in the discussion. However,
   he didn't have this piece. So instead he realized his gap, and said
   "Do you know what I cured?... Dad's loneliness." &larr; because in
   that afternoon, he was my companion to 517 to clean up the mess
   left by the contractor, and on the way home I said thank you to him
   for being my companion. How funny!!</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>On our way home from 517, I was commenting on Noah's hair and asked
   him "what is his secret". Guess what he said? He was very serious
   and also in a good mood, responded that "I will give you one
   advice, is to use woman product." "Why woman product?" "因为她们总
   是想要look good, so you must use woman product" "所以你用她们的
   product, 你也会look good" "是啊，and I use 妈的shampoo" "是吧， 但
   是那都得等很久，像什么15分钟，我没那个耐心，那你怎么办的？" "I will
   meditate" "meditate?" "yeah" "what if it's still too long?" "那我就
   put on more shampoo"... hahahaha.... this is the very first time
   Noah seriously gives me his advice, and you can tell he is really
   believing in his own discovery in this one!</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>This one heard from his mom. She caught him taking a loooooong time
   in shower, and asked him what's taking him so long. "你的shower 有
   很多头发堵了，我在给你de堵".... what a, Chinglish?</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>On our way back from 517. There was a shower in some areas ahead
    of us. So by the time we were on the road, it was wet. All of
    sudden, Noah said "yi2" "what" "彩色，虹", you know, in a mumbling
    kinda of way, that he heard the word spoken by us, but doesn't
    really know how to say it properly. Very cute!</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>At dinner table, Noah started a thread, "爸，你知道，葡萄美酒夜光
    杯，是啥么？“”知道啊，这个叫唐诗。你咋知道的？“ So it turned out
    he saw it on mom's phone the other night, and he thought it's
    extremely funny, because, "美酒，no wine!" he claimed, and started
    laughing hard, by himself.... errr....pretty speechless ~~</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Had a wechat call w/ 陈思，I figure it would be good to connect
    him with some social friends at his age, and help him to establish
    some confidence. After an hour of talk, I asked "so 陈思家有只兔子
    是吧？”“对，她家有只兔子，还有很多鱼，她还有很多鸟....她还养了个姐
    ".. hahaha... well, so I was overhearing their conversation, that
    the girl introduced her older sister, and Noah brought up the</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Telling Noah we will have 豆腐骨头西红柿汤. He suddenly raised his
    head, looked at with an expression of awe, "等一下，你是说，今天的
    豆腐有骨头?"..... hahaha ~~ The kid is always super <strong>precise</strong>!</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Was at dinner at his mom's place over 2020 xmas. He was having
    something in the breakfast, and his mom commented that this is
    something he has been longing to have, thus he is now 如原以偿. He
    immediately countered, "No! 我没有常想(这个东西）I didn't always
    think of it".. oh well, what can I say?</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>At lunch chatting w/ Noah about the small room I'm thinking to
    decorate. "我觉得那个屋子可以用来打游戏“，”I agree! 它又小，又黑，
    还有门".. huh!? hahaha, and he bursted into a laugh himself
    also. Both of us realized what he meant &rarr; so he could shut
    himself inside and play as much as he wants. Hahahaha.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>After dinner, showing Noah the old album I brought back from
    Suzhou. There was picture of Dad when he was probably late 20s,
    and he didn't recognize him. Then on the next page, another of
    his, probably early 40s, and Noah pointed it out, "这是也爷爷!"
    "Not bad. How do u know?" "Because 他在 sporting 他现在的
    look"... hahaha!</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Saturday morning, asked Noah to help w/ breakfast &mdash; cutting
    an apple, and a grapefruit. I guessed I said "orange" when I
    handed the grapefruit to him. So he <strong>peeled</strong> it, the way he
    always wanted to do.. I held my tongue this time, "let him do
    this, and it should be fine".. then, I put some on his plates,
    knowing grapefruit isn't his thing. But, behold! He took a bite,
    and gave me a looking of eating a poison! "爸！！！你为什么说这是
    orange! 这是grapefruit!" "我说了！""你没有!!""咋了吧!?" I asked. "
    如果这是grapefruit, 我刚才cut的时侯会更严肃点!!""what do mean by严
    肃点!?"... so it turned out, by peeling his way, he left some
    those soft skins, which, according to him, is bitter, and his 更严
    肃点 is to remove more, if not all of, those skins... hahaha!! 更
    严肃点~~~</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Trying to solicit him taking interest in Chinese. So I let him
    watch the romance of the three kingdom by 横山光辉, w/ English
    subtitle. So it calls "字“ as <em>style name</em>. So I was trying to
    teach him what a 字 means in a name, then, he pointed at the
    screen, "萌的!!!" (the sound), and it is showing 曹操， "style
    name: Mengde".... hahahaha!!! Noah noah noah, what am I gonna do
    w/ your Chinese!?</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>11/15/2022 Sitting in Starbuck and he just finished his math
    homeworks. Asking him to throw away a leftover box to trash. Guess
    what!? He turned around w/ a stack of triangometry problem sheets
    in hand, and immediately he started working on it!? ... is this
    the same guy I know!? Unbelievable! and he looked quite happy
    working on the sheets. What a surprise! I asked him why, and he
    said he just wants to do more.. and 2nd trip to the same trash can
    he picked up yet another stack! hahaha... we joked about some kid
    throwing away his/her math homeworks that way so to avoid working
    on it and had a good laugh out of this. Wonderful time!</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>2/23/2023 On our way to his swimming. "Did you eat something?"
    "yeah I had salmon" "哦， 是吧，家里有salmon啊!!" "现在没了"
    ... hahaha... such an American way of understanding Chinese. No
    Chinese native would have interpreted the line on such a face
    value, but he did.. it was just halirious! I think this will be a
    great item for some foreigner's TOEFL test someday.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>5/29/2024 Sitting at a high table McDonald's after his swim
    training at night. I said, "I'm thinking to get a 大house, you
    know, with a big yard...你觉得这主意怎么样?" He shook his head. "
    不好吗？" Shaking head.. "为啥?" "你一take eyes off,它就跑了
    "... huh? I couldn't understand what he was saying.. "huh? 为啥它
    就跑了?" "你看，你不是说大hao4 (s)zi1 么，你不看它它就跑了".. then
    I suddenly realized, he meant 大house as 大耗子. Hahahaha!!!!</p>
</li>
