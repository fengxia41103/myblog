This is a quite fascinating [book][1]. Actually I started to find
myself always fascinated by early first-person account of China. I
have this curiosity of what this country was like, and everytime I
read a book like I always found myself keep thinking how similar
peopel then to people now, and how unchanged this place has been. This
actually bothers me because I think I am being biased against them,
that I have already drawn a conclusion and am therefore seeing
evidence (and seeking evidence in haystack) everywhere.

The conversation between Bea and her Russian pupil is just funny:

> Speaking of saving for a rainy day, one of my Russians met that
> expression in his reading the other day, and wanted to know what it
> meant. I said he might be sick and need money for doctor or
> hospital.

> "But doctors and hospitals are free."
>
> "You might want to save to send your child to college."
>
> "But all education is free."
>
> "Your house might burn up."
>
> "The I would be given another."
>
> "You might want to travel."
>
> "If the government allows me to travel, they will pay my expenses."
> 
> I felt uneasy at the thought of a culture in which there is no motive
> for thrift, and in which one may not make one's own decision to
> travel. 

So even in the time of such, she had an acute sense of disillusion of
utopia however well its golden cage may give its captives. But again,
I start to wonder whether it is just a matter of choice of life style,
like belief, is completly subjective and opinionated.
