What is an addiction then!? and why is this word negative!? I
think when we talk about this word, the implied message logic is that
_it is bad because it puts a person into an **extreme** condition,
thus is not sustainable, thus is not healthy_ &larr; so there are
quite a few assumptions:

1. Extreme state is, bad (but is it bad because of #2 below, that it
   is not sustainable!? or, regardless it is sustainable or not, it is
   just bad being in any kind of extreme? and is there such a thing as
   "extreme & good"?).
   
2. Unsustainable is no good. Well, this is actually interesting then,
   because then I would ask, what is the sustainable state!? Is
   drinking water instead of being an alcoholic more sustainable!? Is
   it defined as being able to live longer, thus more _sustainable_?
   or less likely to be bored of!? This last one must not be true
   then, because alcoholics don't get bore of liquors, thus definition
   of this word, alcoholic!
   
   So, it is not whether you will be tire of doing the same thing over
   and over. What about being able to do that longer than others!?
   When you can walk longer than sprint, walking, is more sustainable
   than sprint. Therefore, if taking average course one can last
   longer than the other, this one is more sustainable.
   
3. These two criteria have nothing to do with whether this addiction
   makes one happy. You can be addicted to an act that makes you
   really happy, but it is still an addiction, thus, bad.
   
So, is being in an extreme state really bad!? I actually start to think
that they are not.

First of all, what is an alternative if not being extreme? Somewhere
in the middle. But how to identify of this point!? Without knowing it,
how do we know we are off!? and even if we do know where it is, is
keeping at that balance state all the time possible!? I would argue it
is not. So people are thinking of deviation &mdash; what is the degree
of us deviating from this balance? But this leads to two questions:

1. How to measure a deviation &larr; and this implies we know two data
   points, the reference (that balance point), and where we are.
   
2. What is the criteria so it becomes bad?

So, as long as we don't have a definition of these two, we can't
battle "not being extreme", because we just don't know.

Secondly, we associate addition to things like smoking, drugs, these
things get you high, well, under the name of also _making you
happy_. Therefore we think they are bad, because your body craves for
them once you are addicted. But is getting high, bad? We know these
things make your brain emmit some chemicals so you feel the
experience. But other actions can trigger them just as well &mdash;
sports, sex, and in stone age days, hunting, war &rarr; we know
getting in a fight will get your body into a state that it feels,
high, then extreme fatigue &larr; isn't this the same cycle that
getting high experiences!? I don't know. Maybe they are different
chemicals, different processes, but I think there are tremendous
overlap between the two.

Thirdly, if getting high makes you, happy. Don't we all be pursuing,
happiness, in life, as the ultimate goal!? Then, here it is, why not!?
So it is not sustainable, won't last, but then, what will? I feel
there is a convolution of logic &rarr; this doesn't feel right, but I
don't know what it is, 诡异的逻辑.

Well well. So I don't have an answer, not even a train of thoughts,
just a mess of conflicting statements. But still, as I have been
telling Noah, as I have been told by my dad at Noah's age, two things
don't touch &mdash; drugs, and gambling. Addiction or not, they will
ruin your life, and your happiness.

Addicted to love? Might be ok.
