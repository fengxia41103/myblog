Reading [The rape of the Nile][1], quite a fascinating book.
It's rather surprising how recent these events were &mdash;
we are talking about the mid-19th century, what, about 150 years ago?
In prospective, the history of Egypt and its glorious monuments have
been around for much longer than that.

What really bothers me, however, is how the people at those days were
treating these ancient artifacts back then &mdash; just like the
horror propaganda I have been told about China's treasure being looted
and trashed by barbarians of both foreign and domestic origin (and
admittedly much more by the domestic ones), the same theme of sadness
was playing in Egypt, over and over and over again. Pyramids were used
for quarrying building materials, and artifacts were given as a token
to influential whoever the ruler was trying to please. At the end of
the day, no one was looking at them as arts of unreplaceable
value. They were free gifts left over by ancient anonymous &mdash;
cheap as dirt, and only meaningful to one when it could bring glory,
fame, profit, or the things s/he wants at that given moment. There was
no perpetual value, no inherited value, certainly no emotional value
worth preservation, and much less of responsible value by making them
available for the generations to come &rarr; consume and dispose them
now, by me, period.

But then, if you feel it is clear now to see how terrible those deeds
were, I kept wondering how to justify this view when I'm really
reading all these from a distant **present**, or to say looking from a
rear view mirror. I hold a different prospective than those in the
book at the time. You can call it a progress of civilization as we are
now understanding more of its history (since no one was even able to
read the Egyptian words till the [Rosetta stone][2], and even that
took a few decades before it was deciphered), thus its importance and
value. But does it state that it's not fair to those people we call
_barbarians_ these days since they were really operating in a
disadvantage comparing to what we know today? Well, then why being
_fair_ is a measure of good or bad anyway? who said it must be _fair_?
If you throw these out, then how does one look at so called
**history** and opinionate it one way or the other? After all, each
holds his own life experience as the only foundation he could relate
and refer to. So it becomes a completely random chance that someone's
reference happens to match the one that later gets realized 
and is labelled as a **human progress**, which then leads them
standing out as the pioneer and a great mind, while in reality, who
the heck know what it is going to be tomorrow!? 

Further, when western museums were the buyer who drove all the tomb
robbers and antique traders, the sad reality back then was that local
folks didn't give a fxxx of all the mummies and monuments. So now fast
forward 150 years, it is just not reasonable
to *blame** them for collecting them in the name of `loot`
or `steal`. Their argument is valid &mdash; the antiques did have a
better chance to be preserved and to survive, and they did have a
better vision (if can be called enlightened) of the future than
others. But this leads to another dilemma.

Does it then mean that a so called _advanced_ group or society should
be in position to take over things from a _less advanced_ group so to
maximize the overall benefits of, what, society? human race?
history?... I don't find a word to describe this. But you see what I'm
driving towards right? This argument definitely feels, not right
morally, but right factually. Let's say we let them do that, and the
future proves they were right &larr; both of these are pretty
**SIGNIFICANT** assumptions. But does it mean that the less advanced
group will be locked in their inferior position/class forever? If I
enjoy the benefit of taking over others' stuff, what incentive do I
have to educate them and lift them up out of their existence so to
_compete_ with me!? Isn't this the exact thought any privileged
subject has and wish to maintain, forever!? So the elites rule us all,
because even you are the _privileged_ one, chances are you are not the 
single top guy of the food chain, then by this reasoning it derives
that you will also be ruled, crashed, bullied, and wasted, maybe just
with a slight less degree of destruction, but the idea is the
same. Well, then why do you want to promote that!?

How confusing! I think this whole mess of arguments really lead to the
problem that there is no _compass_ in my life these days and the line
between right and wrong is completely blurred (or just disappeared). 
I lost faith in the future, has serious contempt of the present, and
has a shaky feeling of the past. [Santayana][3] warned that "
Those who do not learn history are doomed to repeat it." But what you
learned from history isn't really a truth or even fact, but a
hindsight of judgement which itself could just be a complete wrong
in the next few decades because of the prospective shift. Then, what
could one really learn from so called history, if anything?

马未都说："历史没有真相，只残存一个道理". Now even this seems over
optimistic. There isn't even a 道理, just a story, a legend,
a myth. So to this point, history doesn't really matter much, nor it
has any value in anything. Its left over artifacts are valuable, when
they have a market (which means someone wants it for $$). If no one
wants it, oh well, they are just a whole pile of dirt regardless what
they are named, mummy, gold, or whatever.
