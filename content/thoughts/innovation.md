Slug: can you innovate
Author: Feng Xia

This has been a topic on my mind for quite some time now ever since I
worked in Shanghai in 2016 and witnessed things that quite annoyed me,
especially from a software engineer prospective. 

So the backdrop is that Chinese people have been encouraged by
the country's phenomenal success in economy and are now moving from _made in
china_ to _created in china_ &mdash; a sound idea, just like
_socialism_ or any other idea someone around the corner has. The
idea is not the problem, the execution of the idea is.

Over the past few years I am convince that ideas are cheap. Everyone
has some good ideas. Talk to your family and friends, or just a
stranger met on the street. Yes, from his/her view there are things
that are not quite right, and there lies an opportunity for smart
people to tackle, and if solved, someone's life will then become a
bit, better. That's the hope.

The challenge, of course, is how we are gonna find a solution for this
problem, let alone a _satisfactory_ one? Well, no one can really
define that. Even when you talk about a _working_ solution, the
counter argument will be what you mean by _working_? How do you prove
it works? This sounds more and more like an attorney's job now,
doesn't it? Well, let's not get tangled by this philosophical thought
and switch gear to think about technology.

Yes I'm a tech guy and am on a _perpetual_ learning curve of some new
or unfamiliar technologies. When a growing age, I found myself even
constantly on a review session of some old technologies &mdash; a
command line I can't think of anymore after a couple month, a Python
syntax that now eludes me and I have to google it &mdash; this is not
even stackoverflow because SO is used only when I can ask a question
that has passed Python 101. I'm talking about _google python built-in
function_ type of basics. Shame. But there are just so many
technologies that one has to know in order to piece all them together
somehow to make your stuff work. So to me I'm constantly learning,
constantly thinking, constantly re-inventing wheels or copying someone
else's wheels, and constantly writing something **new** and **fresh**
that only my brain is producing. _Is this innovation?_

So what bugs me about this wave of so called innovation, which,
besides anything else, certainly created an army of _entrepreneurs_ or
has drilled the thought of start-your-own-business as the crown jewel
of living for anyone who is between age 20-40. And supposedly you
should retire if you are 40+, either with loads of money due to your
successful business, or live as a happy square dancer. Well, if you
own a condo in a city, you are congrat yourself for a successful life,
too. 

There is nothing wrong about trying to create something. I think it's
built in human nature, and usually the smarter you are, the more
likely your mind will go all over the place. But let's stop right
here. Walking into any coffee shop in Shanghai these days, any group
of:

1. more than 2 people (2 is more likely love birds chatting), 
2. the age band fits the description above, and
3. using a laptop
4. bonus: it's running a PPT
5. super bonus: it's running code

Yes, they are literally in an  _innovation_ frenzy. Just get a cup
of coffee and eavesdrop for a while, the buz words are bound to
flow with full strength: `cloud computing`, `big data`, `share
economy`, `amazon`, `google`, `BAT`, `R` ... nowadays one should
also add `AI`, `alphaGo`... whatever the problem is, or even the
solution might be, it must be loaded with these words so to be even
**acceptable** &mdash; but, acceptable to whom!?

I really shouldn't bash these ppl. After all they are thinking, and
trying to create a solution. My problem is that many conversations I
have participated all went with roughly 30-min of discussion of the
problem and rest of life for the grand future of the "what if we get
10% of the 13-billion population using this!?" How exciting! Of
course, even selling a million toilet paper is an exciting business,
and if you can figure out to sell them by the piece instead of roll,
man, you will be a legend for sure.

But that's exactly my annoyance &mdash; <span
class="myhighlight">these are not solutions</span>. These are buzz
words that anyone can pick up from a blog or a chat forum. They are
window dressers that makes a content pretty and looks more
sophisticated than it is. But do you understand what they are really
about? Let's say _cloud computing_. Why cloud? what make a cloud? Yes
there is the [NIST definition][1], but that doesn't really mean
anything to me if you can't relate it to your own context (the problem
we are to solve) and explain (clearly):

1. what will a cloud be used for
2. how it is going to help
3. which layer is going to help, and
4. how that decision was made

To the minimum, if you are thinking cloud is to build a central data
center on your own, then you don't know what you are talking about; if
you are to rent from AWS, then can you tell me what cost you are to
bear in exchange for its service (and I can tell you now it is not
just money... no, not data security, nor privacy, nor vendor lock
in... these are all valid points, but the real bummer, is the learning
curve) &rarr; AWS is a wonderful service. It is a Ferrari with a
million dials. The magic word _cloud computing_ or _AWS_ is not going
to just spit out a solution. It will help, dramatically, if you know
how to use it... Man! I can't tell you how many times I had to battle
some Chinese IT fella in 2015 who wanted to sell his client
an Oracle database (the swiss army knife of DB) but
failed to come up a single example of which feature of the Oracle is
needed in his application, and why alternatives are inferior? Come
one! if you are too lazy or just not good enough to set up an
apple-to-apple evaluation, then all what you are saying about the
wonderful things Oracle can do, are just from their brochure, and
it's a shame if you call yourself _engineer_ or _IT guy_.

And we haven't touched the core of innovation yet. What really matters
is the **domain** knowledge &mdash; How much do you really know the
problem?  and the context of the problem? what's the assumption you
are taking to think of this as a problem? and what method you used to
analyze the cause of this problem? how do you support your argument?
and how sound is your support, both qualitatively and quantitatively?
... too often, the tool becomes the solution, or the rosy forecast
becomes an addiction, that an even stronger dose will shot through
vein that gets you high &mdash; _disruptive_, _cross discipline (跨
界)_, _horizontal and vertical integration (整合)_ ...hey, hand me the
BS dictionary, pls.

No, no, no. It is not going to be _disruptive_, and it simply can NOT
be disruptive. First of all, any domain has a food chain. The solution
to your problem, whatever it is, is not going to, and should not,
replace the whole chain, period. If you think the problem you are to
solve is so big that it requires redrawing the entire picture from
scratch, then not only the problem is not broken down sufficiently to
become executable, but you should seriously re-evaluate your
assumptions of the topic see if you have missed or misunderstood
something big.

Second, solution, from my 20 years of development, can only be
**incremental**. There is no other way. You always started with a
version 1, and ended up with version 989287429 after that many
iterations of trial-and-error. If you ignore (or downplay) the
intermediates, viola, your end result looks absolutely **innovative**!
Think about Newton's apple, or Einstein's, or Google, or Amazon, some
great arts, or any disruptive technology/solution you have in mind,
just look closer, read and research, you will find breadcrumbs all
over its path. Didn't I say how important _domain knowledge_ is? Those
breadcrumbs are the domain knowledge. I think too many innovators are
jumping to a solution prematurely because they skipped or skimmed by
getting that domain knowledge, and too many times they think they find
a silver bullet, on the first run, and it is going to work. But I
don't buy it. Solution and success come from **iteration**.  As long
as you can have a sandbox, you are in position to try out your
theories and use the trial-and-error to tune in your thought and
effort. There are no short cut, no revolution, no magic, but
continuous cycles of try-measure-tune-repeat.

So back to China's innovation frenzy, if being _disruptive_ is
the theme, well, I think you are to fail without a doubt. Loading buzz
words are shallow and cheap, just like any idea is cheap,
too. Research and analysis is hard, really, really hard. Learning a
new technology, having a sandbox to iterate, re-inventing a
wheel... these are all hard, and necessary. Innovation is not glory
at all. It is a lot of learning, experimenting, stuck without a
solution in sight, give up, and when all pieces are ready to fall in
its place, they will... the question is, will they fall on you?
