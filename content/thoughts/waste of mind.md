Wow, this is quite unbelievable! I read a line:"A mind is a terrible
thing to waste." (looking it up, there is an [NPR][1]!) yes I have
always remembered this line, because it is so true &mdash; despite
that I have been losing faith of human being in general, I do consider
a mind, well, regardless it is doing good or evil, is a terrible thing
to waste. After all, I think the mind is the one only thing that human
may come out of his own misery. Reading books always gives me this,
false hope maybe, that once a while, just about everything goes into
darkness, there is some mind, somewhere, somehow, wired so
differently, that sparks a light, that gives, hope.

The recent movie of ["Dying to Survive"][2] is another case in point,
that goods came out of something so original, so humble, so remote
from being grand, memorable, plausible, beneficial. This feels almost
like the argument that free market ppl like to say the best drive to
create something good is the individual's extreme selfishness to
maximize his/her own gain &mdash; it's the root of both good and bad,
twins.

Well, before I started this article, I was actually going to make a
fun of this news I just came across, that "陕西省社科联经研究决定开展
“梁家河大学问”课题研究", because my first reaction is, what a waste of
mind! But then, why wouldn't such nose browning aldo derive something
worthwhile? What's the difference between the drive to propose such
research versus peddling something legal or illegal just to make
money? If we don't understand how these are different, how do I know I
don't step over the _line_ someday myself, and wasted the mind I have?

I don't  have an  answer. Somehow I  do have a  gut feeling  that this
drive is quite  different from just an  urge to make money.  It is not
greed... well, not a greed of $$, but can we say it's a greed of fame?
of [social  capital][3]? and don't  these greed  all converge to  be a
greed of $$ at the end anyway? hmmm... this is worth looking into, how
do we categorize  greeds!? and what are the inter-links  among them? I
think the older I  get, the clearer I start to  realize that these bad
words/concepts should  not be avoided.  Instead, we should  look right
into its  eyes, with fear  and uncertainty maybe, but  nonetheless, to
face it, so  you can watch, study,  maybe figure out how  strong it is
really, and  start to  see a  strategy to break  it down  into smaller
tasks so to defeat it, if we really think it's a bad thing to exist.

It's not easy to produce proposals for such a dry topic (IMHO). But
well, I have to admire their capability to tolerate the BS, to even
think in this BS fashion, internalize this BS, and become thoughtful
enough to put such concept together.

Wow, I guess theirs minds are probably even smarter than mine. With
that endurance and persistence, they could certainly do wonderful
things, be successful and all that. And here they are, putting their
mind into a study of these topics, certainly the prospective of where
to start is totally beyond me. But as a human member, they have
demonstrated an incredible character in spending energy and mind on
something as arcane, uninteresting (to me at last) as these topics, I
have to say, like the twins of greed, this sheds a hope on us &larr;
who knows, somewhere, someone, will use this same character on
something, good, and we will all be thankful then.

So I think, there isn't a waste of mind, as long as your mind is
working on something, and better be something boring, hard, no one
likes to bother type. Even by just absorbing yourself into these so
you don't let loose your brain power on something truly terrible, like
crimes, then you are still doing the society a favor.

What a bizzare logic this is!
