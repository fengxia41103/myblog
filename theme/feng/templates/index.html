            <p>
                I build prototypes. My mission is to lower the for entrepreneurs to enter the web application mobile application arena.

            <p>
                I specialize in building and delivering proof-of-concept (POC) using robust system architecture and technology. I believe many critical details questions can only surface through trying. An idea can look great on paper (or napkins), but to get all pieces working coherently together as one system is not an easy task. A prototype is an attempt to to build that coherent integration. To the least tt is a guage to test how deep that water is. A working POC is exciting because it lowers risk, raises confidence, removes ambiguity, clarifies design, discovers barrier, and points out a direction going forward.

                Here I present some samples of my research works and recent projects (2015-16) &mdash; design documents, lesson learned, tools used, thoughts and discussions. Dig in and get an idea of what I could do for you.
