[code][2].

The key is to learn and understand [fibonacci sequence][3].

- **problem space**: < 4000,000
- **test criteria**:
    1. is fibonacci number
    2. is even number

```python
def fibonacci(N):
    '''Generate Fibonacci number less than N
    '''
    p1 = 1
    p2 = 2
    while p1 <= N:
        yield p1
        p1, p2 = p2, p1 + p2

def main():
    bound = 4000000
    results = filter(lambda x: not x % 2, fibonacci(bound))
    print sum(results)
```

**Note**: we are using `filter` which will actually build a list in
memory. This works when problem space is not overwhelmingly
large. What if ``bound=4*10^100000000000`` (hypothetically speaking)?
Generator can run iterate up to that bound, but building in memory
list would be disastrous. So here we are being cheap. A proper
approach is simply counting the ``sum`` value as we go &rarr;
`count += next number`.
